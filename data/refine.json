That\u2019s the dilemma facing many elite athletes when they stop chasing their dreams and transition into retirement. Far too young for slippers and often at an age when non-sporting peers are still climbing the career ladder . . .For decades, they\u2019ve trained relentlessly, dedicated to the pursuit of glory \u2013 to victory and to defeat. They\u2019ve made unimaginable sacrifices, sidestepped the trappings of \u2018ordinary\u2019 life, invested blood, sweat and tears to represent their people on local, national and international stages.Along the way they\u2019ve formed tight-knit communities and friendships. Adhering to rigid training schedules, out-of-step with loved ones, they become somewhat institutionalised. But such steadfast, single-minded obsession cannot last forever.When that final whistle sounds, these athletes retire, often left behind by fans and team-mates. An overwhelming uncertainty lingers: \u2018What now?\u2019 Post-sport, life is daunting. From incredible highs to earth-shattering lows. Studies show that 46% of retired athletes experience depression or anxiety.When the World Stops Watching tells intimate stories of 14 Irish sportspeople. From rugby grand slam winners to Olympic boxers, European Tour golfers to World Cup footballers, from local GAA heroes to international hall of fame winners \u2013 offering front-row insight into how elite sportspeople fare in their sporting afterlife.With searing honesty, these athletes recount dramatic personal and social changes, from loss of income to loss of purpose. A complex journey of resilience and regret, despair and desolation, fear and fulfilment is undertaken as tentative new beginnings dawn.

In classrooms, some examples which are used for simplifying and understanding the material better are in macroscopic dimension and students do not understand particles such as atoms, molecules and ions well. In order to help them understand these concepts in macroscopic dimension, illustration is used. In illustration, students can reflect different concepts of chemistry which have learnt during teaching. One of the illustration methods is to use painting art, as one can determine the extent to which they have understood from chemistry concepts and relationship among different areas of the sciences, society and technology by studying paintings of these students. The Aim of this research is to determine through their paintings whether students have understood the taught concepts in chemistry of the first grade of high school in IRAN or not. These chemistry subjects include water, atmosphere, minerals and fuel. After teaching the above topics, the students were asked to select a subject at their will and paint about it. This research has been performed in two separate cities in IRAN but it has been implemented in equal age groups and it was specified that different places of residence had effects on selection of painting subject. Our experience showed that use of this method led to deep learning in the students and provided the opportunity for them to express their beliefs in scientific concepts in their own way and language. On the other hand, teacher performs a kind of continual evaluation in this way and understands students\u2019 misconceptions and tries to remove these errors before beginning new subject. This method is interesting for students so that most of them mentioned that painting the chemistry was new and interesting experience.", "Loss of interstitial cells and a fibromuscular layer on the luminal side of the colonic circular muscle presenting as megacolon in an adult patient.BACKGROUND: Animal studies have shown that the neuromuscular structures on the luminal side of the colonic circular muscle coordinate circular muscle activity. These structures have been identified by electron microscopy in the normal human colon, but have never been thoroughly studied in patients with acquired intestinal hypoganglionosis. AIMS: To perform histological, immunocytochemical, and electron microscopic examinations of the colon of a patient with acquired intestinal hypoganglionosis presenting as megacolon. PATIENT: A 32 year old man with a one year history of constipation and abdominal distention, a massively dilated ascending and transverse colon, and a normal calibre rectum and descending and sigmoid colon. He had a high titre of circulating serum anti-neuronal nuclear antibodies. METHODS: Histology, immunocytochemistry (for neurofilaments, neurone specific enolase, synaptophysin, glial fibrillar acidic protein, S100 protein, and smooth muscle alpha-actin), and electron microscopic examinations on the resected colon. RESULTS: The number of ganglion cells and nerve trunks was decreased throughout the colon. Disruption of the neural network and a loss of interstitial cells of Cajal were observed on the luminal side of the circular muscle; in their place, the non-dilated colon contained a hypertrophic fibromuscular layer. CONCLUSIONS: Striking architectural alterations occurred at the site regarded as the source of the coordination of colonic circular muscle activity in an adult patient with acquired intestinal hypoganglionosis presenting as megacolon.[1]\nReferences\n- Loss of interstitial cells and a fibromuscular layer on the luminal side of the colonic circular muscle presenting as megacolon in an adult patient.

In college, this process requires the writing of research papers.In this class, you will write 1 small research paper (1,000 to 1,500 words). This paper is small enough to avoid overwhelming you, but it will give you valuable experience in writing future, more extensive projects, including your comparative paper. The comparative paper is to be 1,500 to 2,500 words in length.Citation Format: You must use a recognized citation format for the research papers. It is your responsibility to learn a format if you havent already learned one another course. I will deduct 20 points from your grade for each paper if the sources are not documented in an approved citation format.Plagiarism: I reserve the right to examine every paper for plagiarism.

I don't know when, but they want this feature as much as you do. We will get it - I just don't know when.\"\nThat's comforting to hear as it would be nice to buy a game for a friend as I've done it many times on Steam for others and likewise others have gifted me games. From a business side of things it makes no sense not to allow the option as there's money to be made and on Steam it works perfectly well. Majornelson also later commented on the state of the Xbox Store with, \"The store is far from feature complete. They've got a lot of things they're working on :) \".

The event, held in the Australian High Commission, coincided with the 60th anniversary of Australia\u2019s diplomatic presence in Malaysia. The New Colombo Plan provides opportunities for Australian university students to live, study and undertake work placements in more than 35 countries across the Indo-Pacific. This year, of the 5,500 students offered opportunities under the New Colombo Plan, more than 150 Australian students will pursue part of their undergraduate studies in Malaysia, as well as gain practical experience through internships, mentorships or work placements. Our students will return to Australia with new insights and perspectives, a greater understanding of Malaysia and its people, new professional networks and lasting friendships. The Australian Government has committed more than $100 million in new funding over five years to implement the New Colombo Plan, which includes both the mobility grants program as well as a prestigious scholarships program. Since its successful pilot in 2014, the New Colombo Plan has supported around 4,600 young Australians experience this invaluable study opportunity in our region. In 2016, the program will continue to grow, offering 100 scholarships and more than 5,450 mobility grants.

In 1722 he was chosen one of the sixteen representative peers for Scotland, and was re-elected in 1727. He attached himself to Lord Carteret, and was not re-elected either in 1737 or 1741, but was returned in 1742, and again in 1747, 1752, and 1761. On the resignation of Sir Robert Walpole in February 1742 he joined Lord Wilmington's administration as principal secretary of state for Scotland. He resigned the office in January 1746, when it was abolished. With his death the office of extraordinary lord of session also came to an end. He was for some time principal keeper of his majesty's signet. In 1761 he was appointed lord justice-general, and was in the same year made a governor of the Bank of Scotland. He died in London on 9 Sept. 1762, and in accordance with directions given in his will was privately buried at Yester in East Lothian. By him the estate of Yester was greatly improved, particularly in the way of enclosing fields and planting trees, and towards the close of the eighteenth century the estate contained some of the finest timber in Scotland. He married, 24 May 1748, Lady Frances, daughter of John Carteret, earl Granville, and they had a family of two sons and four daughters.\n[Scots Magazine; First Statistical Account of Scotland, 1715; Register of Sasines in General Register House, Edinburgh.]", "In digging up material for my smart cities lectures, I have always given a short history of computer graphics by way of background to visualization of cities.

They won by 35 points, outdoing their expected KenPom outcome by 30 points. It was a much-needed win, considering up until then the Wildcats had been the most disappointing team in the Big Ten. Along with the losses of Jared Swopshire and Reggie Hearn, the team is still adjusting to Chris Collins\u2019 new system and has reverted to throwing up threes when their half-court sets have fallen apart. Up until that game, nearly 44 percent of their total shots have been from the three-point line \u2014 most in the conference \u2014 and when they drove the ball to the basket, they weren\u2019t finishing the play either (42.5 percent).

However, Northwestern\u2019s blowout was more a product of a vulnerable opponent rather than any long-term fix..\nUnlike Minnesota, the other Big Ten team adjusting to a new coach, the Wildcats are struggling to adjust to their new system. On Wednesday night, they looked like they started putting things together. Players who were previously struggling showed signs of life. For example, junior Dave Sobolewski (6.7 PPG before Wednesday night) went off for a career high 25 points. But the more likely case is UIC was weak team that was especially vulnerable to Northwestern\u2019s game of shooting the deep ball.

The resin is perfect for use in mixed media and art projects. Simon often demos the resin using the beautiful moulds from Jo over at The Craft Hut some of which we also stock being a proud stockist of theirs. The Resin is quite quick drying and depending on the temperature you can demoted your products after as little time as 8 hours (though best left 12 hours). As with all resins the drying time and curing time are different it is advised this resin should be fully cured within 2 weeks dependant on the temperature. When colouring the resin we have found that our QD sprays works amazingly and are not only easy to mix in but provide a beautiful colour. Why not add some mica for a innteresting sparkly look. This Resin is brilliant to work with however I would like to note it does not have a UV protector in it so if you want a crystal clear resin to cover your art work this really isn't for you as the clear resin will yellow over time unless it is mixed with a colourent, then it will retain its colour.The resin has a minimal odour to it and is not overpowering.When using the product remember to wear your gloves and in a well ventilated area, a mask is also advisable as with all resins.", "******************************************************** alph McBride ) File No. EB-FIELDSCR-14-00015023 Owner of Antenna Structure No. 1058494 ) ) NOV No. V201432540008 Beaumont, Texas ) ) ) ) NOTICE OF VIOLATION Released: April 15, 2014 By the Resident Agent, Houston Office, South Central Region, Enforcement Bureau: 1.

The cochineal scale insect appears in Morocco for the firsttime in Saniet Bergig (Morocco) by the end of 2014. It attacks only cactus plants Opuntia sp. It is characterized by its red color because of the carmine secretion. The origin of these insects is tropical and subtropical forest of America and Mexico. It is soft insect with oval form. The males are winged in contrary of females, which are covered by white wax substance. The females lay eggs after copulation hatched in to small larvae secreting white waxy substance to protect themselves from loss of water and heavy sunrays. The scale insect appears as white cotton-like piles, it moves into the marginal cactus pads, the wind carries the filament waxy substance into new cactus plants. The winged males are disturbing the human populations around the cactus fields. The food national office of Morocco confirms that the cactus fruits consumption do not have any health effect neither for human nor for animals. This scale insect affects cactus yields and causes enormous losses to the plants by sucking their sap lead to pad drought. The cactus plants die when the infestation is heavy. The prevention methods are the best solution to avoid insect transmission and reducing damage. The transport of infested cactus pads and fruits should be prohibited. The plastic boxes are recommended to use instead of woody after washing and disinfecting. Controlling the vehicles are also playing a roll in insect transmission. The control measures should be applied for the disposal of infected plants and using the recommended chemical control by ONSSA.

After the claim is paid, the customer then goes further back in their statements to see when the first error happened and files another claim. If the customer would have claimed the UT the first time it happened, the original claim would then be the customer\u2019s responsibility because they didn\u2019t notify the bank within 60 days of the statement date and it falls 60 days after the first UT yet the bank can\u2019t reclaim the payment it already made. What is the proper process for situations like this? Or does the fault lie with the bank since the bank did not research prior statements looking for the first UT when the customer first filed the claim? Must the bank pay both claims (within liability limits of course) May 6, 2013 at 3:16 pm EDT #3063 rcooperMember.

It merely got me wondering what the correct implementation of a UNIQUE constraint regarding NULL values would be. Verifying my own ideas against the PostgreSQL docs and various results from Google turned up some interesting differences in points of view. Hence the quotes :P I still think one shouldn't allow NULL values in unique constraints unless it's the _only_ value (any value is unique if there are no other values to compare with, after all), but I can't compare myself to C.Date, Darwen or Tom Lane... I'm not a database deity :P I suspect they have some pretty good reasons to treat NULL values in a UNIQUE constraint as different even from other NULL values. It sure makes me curious though ;) Regards, -- Alban Hertroys alban(at)magproductions(dot)nl magproductions b.v.

In this Order, we cancel a proposed forfeiture in the amount of six thousand dollars ($6,000) issued to Isan Telecom, Inc (\"Isan\"). On February 25, 2009, the Bureau issued to Isan a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture (\"NAL\") based on Isan's apparent violation of section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, section 64.2009(e) of the Commission's rules, and the Commission's EPIC CPNI Order, by failing to timely file a compliant annual CPNI certification with the Bureau. 2. Upon review of the record, and based upon additional information provided by Isan, we agree with Isan that it had no telecommunications customers during the 2007 calendar year, thus an annual compliance certification for calendar year 2007 was not due. Accordingly, we find that Isan (\"Act\"), and sections 0.111, 0.311 and 1.80(f) (4) of the Commission's rules, that the proposed forfeiture in the amount of six thousand dollars ($6,000) issued to Isan Telecom, Inc. in the February 25, 2009 Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture IS CANCELLED. 4.

Emotions are part of being human, so the issue is not the emotions, but rather how you view them. We live in a messy world due to The Fall, and that means we are messy at any given time in our lives. Mindfulness and being in the moments says \u201cOk, you have this feeling, don\u2019t deny, and now that you acknowledge it, how are you going to move forward with it, once you release it, the grip it has on you?\u2019 You have a choice, we all do as to how we then move forward once we acknowledge having the feeling we have, even anger. Do we go Destructive Rambo, or Mr. Smith Goes to Washington? Do we stay angry, destroy or process release and rebuild? That\u2019s up to us. When you are mindful, the one thing you can\u2019t do is run. You have to own it as they say, which is not easy. You have to own it when you hear what you don\u2019t want to hear, but deep in your heart you know is truth.

I have only recently found this site and... well... I'm pretty taken aback to be honest. Feel's very much like the Black Hat's from Philip K. D***s novel \"The Adjustment Bureau\". Anyhow, I'm a short film director and I first go onto the shady world behind YT marketting when a guy entered a competition that I entered and I remember one day looking at his video, then the next day looking and he had 22,000 views overnight. When I approached him, he played it all down and said he posted it on his facebook, which immediately got my goat up, the video was seriously not that good at all, not to gurney 22,000 views overnight... the prize bellshiff.... I should have given him a swift crack. So now I am here, with my films and I am slowly realising that the youtube world, isn't as transparent and democratic as it either once was, or as it likes to show. So, I am left asking myself if it is worth it? When someone can make a fairly crud video and publicise it, using what I would say, shady methods. And then there are 'better' films and artists who are being cast aside because of the methods they use. Of course, I suppose it's all about the content, and if your content is as good as it can be then.. (you know the argument)... So, what do I do now? Do I carry on looking at online publishing with an off transparent sheem. Or do I join the ranks, work with IM's and try to ride the storm in a cast iron galleon? Yes, this post is set out fairly dyslexic, because... I am dyslexic and yeah... well, I eat my own snot.", "Mugabe Parties Lavishly on Broke Zimbabwe's Dime Daughter's wedding costs $5M; his own birthday $1M By Matt Cantor, Newser User Posted Mar 13, 2014 1:00 AM CDT 11 comments Comments Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe,left, and his wife Grace arrive for celebrations to mark his 90th birthday in Marondera, east of Harare, Sunday, Feb. 23, 2014. In July, Mugabe who has ruled the nation... (AP Photo/Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi)  bailed on a rumored bailout. Yet somehow, President Robert Mugabe has found enough in taxpayer coffers to fund his daughter's $5 million wedding\u2014not to mention a $5 million pair of North Korean-built statues of himself, as well as his own $1 million 90th birthday bash last month, the Christian Science Monitor reports. \"Mugabe and his government have lost it and all they care about now is the accumulation of wealth and strengthening their hold on power,\" says a former finance minister turned opposition leader. Bona Mugabe was married March 1 at her father's home, with the heads of state of South Africa, Zambia, and Equatorial Guinea in attendance. The president held his birthday at a stadium; 10,000 turned out. The North Korean statues include a 30-foot, $3.5-million bronze Mugabe for Harare and a $1.5 million one for a planned $3.8 million museum in Mugabe's home town. Meanwhile, some government ministers are making more than $40,000 a month while average Zimbabweans earn about $300.

I made the brownies last night and the whole family had some, and while they are not great, they at least cover my chocolate fix. Well I called the manufacturer, Hain Celestial Group, this morning to verify that these brownies were safe for someone with a peanut allergy. The box has no allergy statement on it, so I guess I should have seen that as a warning and not bought the products or at least called before making them. Hind Sight is always 20-20. Well the official stance from the company is that unless the package clearly states that the product was made on a dedicated line, they cannot guarantee the safety of the product for someone with an allergy. I verified that the same rule applies to us celiacs. So, even though the box clearly states Wheat Free in the title of the product, they cannot guarantee that the product is actually wheat free. Isn't this somehow mislabled when the box shows Wheat free and gluten free on the package but the company has no ability to back up the claim of being wheat free and gluten free. So please tell me what the point of calling it wheat free? Should have been named Sort of Wheat Free Brownies or Possibly Wheat free Chocolate Chip Cookies.

They believed that there were evil spirits living in the bodies of dead people By placing heavy stones on the graves they hoped to prevent these spirits from rising. But the marking of graves in some way goes back to very ancient times. Primitive man placed stones or other markings on graves not only to keep the evil spirits from rising, but to mark the spot so he could avoid it. The ancient Greeks used gravestones, and they were usually ornamented with sculpture. The Hebrews marked the graves of the dead with stone pillars. And, of course, the Egyptians marked the places where dead were buried with tombs and pyramids Different peoples used different things for this purpose. Some built vaults, others erected tall pillars of ornamented stone. Some marked their graves with simple slabs of wood or stone; others built magnificent shrines and mausoleums. As Christianity spread, the marking of graves became common. The cross over the grave was the most popular grave mark among Christians. Decorating graves with flowers and wreaths is a custom that goes back to ancient times, too. The Greeks used wreaths made of gold. During the early days of Christianity a custom started of making wreaths of ribbon and paper and giving them to the church as a memento of the person who died. These wreaths would be hung around the walls of the church and stay there for years and years.", "Correspondence: Address correspondence to Susan M. Friedman, University of Rochester, Highland Hospital, Box 58, 1000 South Avenue, Rochester, NY 14620. E-mail: susan_friedman{at}urmc.rochester.edu\nPurpose: We sought to determine whether participants in the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) with an informal caregiver have a higher or lower risk of nursing home admission than those without caregivers. Design and Methods: We performed a secondary data analysis of 3,189 participants aged 55 years or older who were enrolled in 11 PACE programs during the period from June 1, 1990 through June 30, 1998. Cox proportional hazard models determined whether having any caregiver, as well as specific caregiver characteristics, such as either living separately from the enrollee, being over the age of 75 years, providing personal care, not reducing or quitting work to provide care, or not being a spouse, predicted time to nursing home admission. Results: Fewer than half of the participants (49.4%) lived with a caregiver, and 12.4% had no caregiver. Individuals who lived with their caregiver were frailer than either those who lived separately or those without a caregiver. We measured frailty in terms of functional and cognitive status, incontinence, and multiple behavioral disturbances. The presence of a caregiver did not change the risk for institutionalization. None of the caregiver characteristics were associated with a higher risk of nursing home admission. Implications: Unlike individuals in the general population, participants in PACE who lack an informal caregiver are not at higher risk of institutionalization. Further research is required to ascertain whether PACE's comprehensive formal services compensate for the lack of informal caregiving in limiting the risk for institutionalization.\nKey Words: Informal support Institutionalization PACE Social support", "A's Game for the Win!...but then they lost.\nFor Father's Day, the boys & I (and sort of Zoe except her name wasn't on the gift since I wrote the card in early June and wasn't thinking she would be here by Father's Day ha!) gifted Daddy tickets to an A's game.

We left Phillip with Tom's sisters (he played a little musical houses and pretty sure he didn't regret not being able to come with us to the game even one bit...all that attention from cousins & aunties and he was in heaven!) and took Jack Jack, Zoe, and Tom's mom! A night of peanuts, hot dogs, cotton candy, fireworks, and baseball. The perfect all-American evening! PS pretty sure there are no pictures of Zoe and that might be because the sweet grandma in front of me hinted that she might love to hold little 9-day old Zoe and being the brave mama I am I totally gave her up to the complete stranger who kept her for a good two hours haha! Don't worry - she was sitting directly in front of me! And you should have seen how much happiness it brought her to cuddle a little newborn.

Today we went to IKEA for lunch, and bought a new highchair so that Jack-Jack can practise his pincer grip (the one we have doesn't have a tray as it's designed to be used at the dining table, but we tend to feed Jack-Jack in the kitchen at this stage to contain some of the mess!) Jack-Jack shared my meatballs, mashed potato and peas, tried some of Esmeralda's tomato soup, and munched down on some bread roll with gusto, kicking his legs and smooshing mashed potato all over his hands. He seems to be swinging between mealtimes either being an absolute joy or very frustrating and a bit of a battle at the moment (much more from his side than ours, as we're of the philosophy that he gets his calories from his milk and food is just to experience tastes and textures for the next few months at least, so are quite relaxed about the whole thing!)\nAlthough we've mostly cracked naptimes at home, when we're out Jack-Jack rarely naps more than half an hour at a time in the car, buggy or carrier, which can make for some pretty cranky afternoons out.

Years ago, I used to use the old spit method too. Nothing like natural enzyme digestion. I was taught that method by Bonnie Proctor from Providence Hospital, Portland OR in 1976. She was Navy trained. It worked great, but the green stuff after lunch got to be a little too much for the younger histo tech's. Plus, it's not exactly a set standard protocol, since everyone has different enzyme make-up. You also had to rinse it off for a long period of time because it dried out on the parameter. Diastase malt didn't seem to work very well after years of inconsistent results. Our lab switched to amylase digestion. We got more consistent results.

Speaking to GQ prior to his win, Shannon said: \"I think I have developed a really modern brand that has global potential. Everything we have achieved has been quite organic and now the company is at a size where it requires a bit more strategy. It's about being a bit more grown up and focused without losing the excitement and the ideas.

Published on Oct 06, 2015 Editor's Pick Proof that hipster culture isn't dead, but taking over the world: here's a campaign from Turkey that features Istanbul's equivalents to the Williamsburg/Shoreditch crowd, getting hysterical over coffee. Turkish dairy brand Sek is advertising its range of iced coffees with three spots set in a coffee bar named Hipster Hill. Each scenario sees a Hipster collapse with an attack of \"hipsteria\" after facing a challenging situation: a coffee with a normal-sounding name, a drop spilled on his espadrille, an inability to put his jacket on. In each, he has to come to terms with the practical, unpretentious Sek brand. The ads, according to independent agency Blab which came up with the campaign, are aimed at positoning Sek as \"the coffee brand of the post-hipster era.\" \"With its new minimal packaging, it successfully shows that it's catered towards anyone who enjoys coffee, free of pretension,\" said the agency in a statement. It adds that it \"has stirred much controversy among hipsters who claim that they're not hipsters.\" Now that sounds familiar. Rate this Ad You must be registered to rate the ad.

Sliding doors do not \u201ceat up\u201d useful space when opening, unlike swing counterparts, which is especially true for owners of small apartments. It remains only to decide whether to buy a freestanding or built-in wardrobe? Let's try to figure it out.Which cabinet is more expensive?Any built-in furniture that is made to order according to your size will cost more than cabinet furniture. But when ordering a built-in cabinet, you can vary its content as you wish, then you can save on shelves and accessories. We recommend choosing a design based on the dimensions of the room. If the room is small, it is better to give preference to cabinet furniture, it will look less bulky. City Wardrobes uses high-quality materials and works with only reliable suppliers, which allows you to keep the price lower than that of competitors. If the room is large, then it is more advisable to order a built-in wardrobe. It will be a visual continuation of the wall and more harmoniously fit into the interior. The total cost of a separate and built-in wardrobe is approximately the same. A lot depends on the size, internal content and the number of doors.Advantages of fitted wardrobes:\u2022 Affordable price. We have already said that you can vary the content of your own free will. If you abandon the case box and expensive retractable hangers, you can save a lot.\u2022 Lack of gaps between a floor, a ceiling and walls.

Everyone seems to be rocking an accent nail from Rihanna to Vanessa Hudgens, even the models on the Chadwick Bell runway donned the infamous look. So here are some quick tips on how to achieve this ever so popular style. For starters, you have to pick a nail; we love the ring finger, if you\u2019re an accent nail virgin. Once you get the hang of it get a little creative! Try the pointer finger for a little pizzazz, and maybe even the middle finger if you\u2019re feeling edgy. The second step to a great accent nail is you have to pick the perfect color. The best Lauren B. colors to don the accent nail with are bright and fun because after all the point of the accent is to draw attention to your magnificent mani. My go to accent colors currently are Where\u2019s My Oscar? and Hollywood Blvd. Both give that extra special something to my nails that ensures a compliment or two. I also like using complementary colors to highlight each other. You can use Hollywood Blvd to create a gradient nail by gradually applying more polish towards the end of the nail. Remember an accent nail doesn\u2019t always have to be a solid color it can be a fun design, ombre nail or bedazzled nail. Don\u2019t forget the point of this trend is to stand out and show a little more of your personality on your nails!

Enduring physical battles while fighting for civil rights and political battles while representing his constituents from Georgia's Fifth Congressional District in the U.S. House, Lewis leads a life characterized by leadership and an unquenchable desire to create the \"Beloved Community,\" where the goals of personal dignity, human rights, and environmental quality are realities for all people.\nBorn into a sharecropping family and later serving in elected office, Lewis understands environmental justice issues on both personal and political levels. As he noted in the foreword to the book Unequal Protection: Environmental Justice and Communities of Color, \"I [grew up] in Alabama seeing the signs that said 'White,' and 'Colored.' The signs are gone, but the residuals of Jim Crow housing and unfair industrial and land use polices are still with us.\" This understanding led Lewis to introduce the U.S. Congress's first environmental justice bill shortly after the inaugural People of Color Environmental Summit in 1992. For almost a decade, he reintroduced the bill, relentlessly advocating for a clean and healthy environment for all people and paving the way for future successes. Just as African Americans and others mobilized to protest segregation and discrimination, Lewis has said, \"they now mobilized to protest unjust public policies, discriminatory facility-siting practices, unequal protection, and other forms of environmental racism.\" He emphasizes that the goal is not to spread the risk and burden our neighbors, but rather \"to leave our physical environment-the communities where we live, work and play-a little cleaner, a little greener for unborn generations.\"\nAs published in Human Rights, Fall 2003, Vol. 30, No. 4, p.25.", "On date Wednesday 2011-05-04 14:29:42 +0200, Michael Niedermayer encoded: > On Wed, May 04, 2011 at 11:54:26AM +0200, Stefano Sabatini wrote: > > On date Tuesday 2011-05-03 18:47:28 -0700, Baptiste Coudurier encoded: > > > On 05/03/2011 05:56 PM, Michael Niedermayer wrote: > > > > On Tue, May 03, 2011 at 11:32:08PM +0200, Stefano Sabatini wrote: > > > >> --- > > > >> doc/eval.texi | 3 +++ > > > >> libavutil/eval.c | 4 ++++ > > > >> 2 files changed, 7 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-) > > > >> > > > >> diff --git a/doc/eval.texi b/doc/eval.texi > > > >> index d0e04c0..fe3eea6 100644 > > > >> --- a/doc/eval.texi > > > >> +++ b/doc/eval.texi > > > >> @@ -72,6 +72,9 @@ integer.

They transplanted Chinese tea plants, Chinese tea coolies, and various other forms of Chinese skill and expertise into Indian territory, adapting them to an alien natural and social environment through various processes of naturalization. New plants were imported or bred, new curing processes were developed to suit British tastes, and in contrast to the smallholder-based Chinese tea industry, tea in India was grown on a large scale, as part of a plantation system.\nTo investigate these processes of translation and adaptation, and to compare the characteristics of the \u201cculture of tea\u201d in each context, we select technical, institutional, literary, and other texts from the large corpora generated around Chinese and Indian tea to map the operational sequences (cha\u00eenes op\u00e9ratoires) of tea production and consumption that they describe. Plotting and comparing the skills, knowledge, material, and social and symbolic resources mobilized in specific cases, this diagrammatic technique will generate revealing patterns of transmission, nontransmission, and difference between the Chinese and Indian tea systems.\nThe question Where do we put the elephants? suggests the ontological challenges of devising such a mapping system. One of the perils that a British tea-plantation manager in South India faced was elephants. Huge, fierce and hungry, a rampaging elephant can destroy a tea garden in minutes. A bullet would neatly resolve the material problem of the elephant. But the tea estates occupied land leased from the rajah, who reserved the sole right to shoot these royal animals. So how do we enter elephants on our diagram\u2014as a material pest or as a political symbol of the conditional rights to land of British tea companies?", "On Fri, 2011-03-25 at 07:48 -0500, Laura Carlson wrote: > >>.) > > Do you think that it would be a good idea for the spec to have > language for conformance checking tools to do such checks if longdesc > is reinstated into HTML?. > > Use cases are at: > > > What are appropriate way to solve the formal use cases? > I get the feeling from the stated use cases that they are reverse use cases that are made to fit longdesc rather than a list of use cases identified as blind users having.

Copyright 2012 PWxyz LLC\nGr 5-8--After her stepfather beats them up, Carley is placed in foster care while her hard-partying mother recovers in the hospital. Angry, frightened, and determined to be unhappy, the 12-year-old finds the Murphy family quite a change. At first she's difficult, but the kindness of Julie, the mother; easygoing Jack, the father; and the slow acceptance of their three sons predictably turn things around. There is never any doubt that the generous Murphys and a friendship with a girl at school will be redeeming factors for sarcastic, funny, tough Carley. When little Michael Eric has a medical crisis, she cements her place in the family by jumping in to help. Because of the balance between showing her inner good nature and her mean and tough performance, readers might have a hard time recognizing which is Carley's true self and which is the front she is presenting. Her mother, quite surprisingly, turns out to have some redeeming qualities, a fact that provides drama when Carley is conflicted about returning to Vegas or continuing to live in Connecticut with the new family she has made. In the end, the choice is made for her, deflating the tension.

I'd like to announce the availability of a Gnome Bluetooth configuration tool (with screenshots): Fedora already ships a system service called \"hcid\", as part of the Linux Bluez packages. This Gnome tool makes it possible to configure basic Bluetooth device properties like status, name and pairing through this hcid. The actual Gnome tool part is very simple, because it's just a GUI glued on a DBus connection to hcid. It's currently written in C because I couldn't get the Python DBus library to work properly. The main work and important configuration improvements are made in hcid. Changes include: 1. A hcid DBus interface for Bluetooth device management as well as device configuration management, key pair management etc. 2. Plain text files for configuration storage. The current hcid shipped with Fedora uses for example the binary file /etc/bluetooth/link_key for paired keys. This file is based on a binary dump of a struct and as such will be difficult to move accross different architectures, compilers etc. This binary file is automatically converted to a plain text file located in /etc/bluetooth/keytab if this file does not already exists. 3. A device name cache for paried devices, making it possible to display the names of paired devices. 4. Persistant storage of configurations, by saving changes in /etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf, managed automatically by hcid. 5. A man page (hcid.1). These changes are not included in the main hcid branch yet. I think more testing and some technical discussions/improvements on for example the DBus interface are needed before this can happen. Comments? Any interest? (Specific lists for discussing Bluez and Gnome Bluetooth in general are <bluez-devel lists sf net> and <gnome-bluetooth usefulinc com>.)

Barrow first won wide attention with his book The Anthropic Cosmological Principle (1986), coauthored cowritten with Frank J. Tipler. In this work the two scientists set forth weak, strong, and final versions of the anthropic principle\u2014the notion that the universe contains conditions ideal for the development of living beings. Barrow\u2019s 1988 book, The World Within the World, was a study of the origin and development of laws of nature. In 1989, at age 36, he became the youngest person to deliver the Gifford Lectures at the University of Glasgow, in the centennial year of the series.\nIn 1999 Barrow became professor of mathematical sciences at the University of Cambridge. In that year he was also appointed director of the Millennium Mathematics Project, a public education program to help young people understand and appreciate mathematics and its applications. He From 2003 to 2007 he was the professor of astronomy at Gresham College in London. Barrow lectured on cosmology at such venues as the Venice Film Festival, 10 Downing Street (the residence of the British prime minister), Windsor Castle, and the Vatican Palace. His interest in making science understandable to laypeople was demonstrated in a 2006 lecture at London\u2019s Royal Society, in which he explained why it was possible to send a rocket to the Moon but not to predict tomorrow\u2019s weather accurately. In addition to his numerous nonfiction books, Barrow wrote the critically acclaimed play Infinities (2002), which was staged at several theatres, including La Scala in Milan. The recipient of many honours, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 2003.", ". Guilds essentially allow players to form small to large groups, with smaller questing and dungeon parties being formed either on a need-basis or more permanently. Unlike more traditional Role Playing Games (RPGs) on video game consoles where a player usually ventures into the virtual world alone as a single character (like Assassin\u2019s Creed) or as a group of controllable companions (like Final Fantasy games), MMOs create environments that encourage player-player interaction within the game as certain activities like raids and dungeon boss battles are easier to navigate when players take on different roles (the healer, the tank who draws enemy attention, and the character classes that do damage-per-second are some of these roles) in order to enhance the effectiveness of the group. Guilds are not only for questing and raiding, but are also ways for new players to be mentored by veteran players and come with a number of perks and opportunities that a lone player would not have access to, such as item trading. Though MMOs do have an underlying storyline driving the game world and creating overarching goals for players, it is the interaction between players that comes to embody the bulk of their experiences within the games, transforming individual gameplay from a solitary experience to one with a seemingly infinite number of connections. One of the biggest draws of guilds is the communication nexus that exists between members, as players find not only companions within the game worlds, but also connections outside of the games, through general discussion forums on official game websites, guild forums, in-game channel chats, social media like Facebook, and personal emails and phone calls.", "Home \u203a Forums \u203a Forum International Section \u203a Off topics \u203a etilaam 0.5 buy online This topic has 0 replies, 1 voice, and was last updated 2 weeks, 4 days ago by Judson Coghlan.

Daniel and many other refugees have spent all of their money on their passage to this new land and thus have no money to give the greedy officials. Daniel then meets David, a Russian Jewish man, who fled Russia because of his Jewish beliefs many years prior to Daniel's departure from Germany. David is an ice cream vendor and spends a lot of time with the newly arrived refugees. He introduces Daniel to Cuban life, helping him learn to speak Spanish and adjust to his new home.

(AP Photo/IntelCenter, File) (Newser) \u2013 The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria is \"not a branch of al-Qaeda,\" Ayman al-Zawahiri declared in a statement posted online yesterday. \"Al-Qaeda is not responsible for ISIS' actions,\" and has \"no connection\" to it, al-Qaeda General Command said, according to the BBC. It added that al-Qaeda \"was not pleased\" with the group's creation. It also decried the increasingly intense infighting between Islamist factions in Syria and the \"shedding of protected blood.\" But this weekend ISIS fighters assassinated two rival rebel leaders in a series of bomb attacks, al-Jazeera reports, in an apparent shift in tactics. A double suicide bombing took out the leader of Liwa al-Tawhid on Saturday in Aleppo, while another attack in Hama killed the leader of the powerful Suqour al-Sham. Al-Qaeda was opposed to the group that became ISIS ever entering the Syrian conflict, with Zawahiri ordering it to return to Iraq in May, Aryn Baker at Time points out. But ISIS' leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, defied him, saying, \"I have to choose between the rule of God and the rule of Zawahiri, and I choose the rule of God.\" My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting | 28% Hilarious 52% Intriguing 3% Depressing 3% Brilliant 4% Scary 10% Ridiculous", "Hi all, For my own study, I've been playing around with various NP complete problems. Previuosly I was doing so in Java, but because I want to learn Haskell, I'm trying to port the algorithms. In Java, I had an abstract class called AbstractNPProblem which looked like this: public abstract class AbstractNPProblem implements NPProblem { public abstract boolean validates(Certificate c); public abstract List<Certificate> certificates(); public boolean decide() { for (Certificate c : certificates()) { if (validates(c)) { return true; } } return false; } } This has one problem, however: it is slightly dynamically typed. Anybody that implements the verify method must cast the object c to a particular type (could be a bitmask, a list of integers, a subgraph, etc.) I'd like to get rid of this problem in porting to Haskell. Here is how I am trying to solve the problem, using multi-parameter type classes. class NPProblem inst cert where validates :: cert -> inst -> Bool certificates :: inst -> [cert] decide :: inst -> Bool decide i = any (\\x -> x `validates` i) $ certificates i Unfortunately, ghc throws the following type error: NPProblem.hs:5:45 Could not deduce (NPProblem inst a) from the context (NPProblem inst cert) arising from use of `certificates' at NPProblem.hs:5:45-58 Possible fix: add (NPProblem inst a) to the class or instance method `decide' In the second argument of `($)', namely `certificates i' In the expression: (any (\\ x -> x `validates` i)) $ (certificates i) In the definition of `decide': decide i = (any (\\ x -> x `validates` i)) $ (certificates i) Could somebody explain what is wrong with my intuitive approach? Also, is multi parameter type classes the way to go, or is there a better way?", "Blackberry is known to be one of the most premium smartphone makers. These smartphones have been pretty absent from the market lately, because of the revolution that was brought about by Android platform and smartphones with large sized touchscreen displays. Last handsets by Blackberry which tried their worth to prove Blackberry\u2019s metal were Blackberry Z3 and Blackberry Z10. And then we saw a bigger and better Blackberry Z30 coming up to the horizon.\nAccording to a report from Blackberry Central, the images of a new smartphone from Blackberry have surfaced. In the images, the device looks to possess close similarity with Blackberry Passport, based on design and outlook. The smartphone packs square dimensions and possesses a physical keyboard with a large touch screen as compared to the area covered by the keyboard. The smartphone, as per the leaked reports, will feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor and will boast an LCD touch screen with a screen resolution of 1440\u00d71440 pixels.\nSpeaking of the smartphone camera, a 13 MP primary camera with LED flash will be found onboard along with a 2 MP front facing camera for capturing selfies and facilitating video calling. The new Blackberry Oslo will feature the latest Blackberry OS platform i.e 10.3.2. The reports also suggested that the phone will inbox a huge battery with a power rating of 3450 mAh.

Lutz said the battery technology has shown no problems so far and a working lithium-ion battery pack for the Volt could be demonstrated by June 2008. But the Volt requires a complete re-engineering of a standard passenger vehicle, he said. Environmental advocates see plug-ins as a way to cut fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The sharp increase in fuel economy the vehicles could also help automakers meet more stringent U.S. fuel economy standards. GM's head of North American operations, Troy Clarke, later told reporters that GM may launch a plug-in version of its Saturn Vue sport utility vehicle in 2010, possibly making it the first commercially available electric vehicle. \"It could precede the Volt,\" said Clarke, adding the Saturn Vue would run 10 miles on battery power alone. An official for Ford Motor Co <F.N> said Monday its own tests on a plug-in car should last several years and are not based on being the first to launch an all-electric vehicle. \"This is not a case where we are being driven by first-to-market (strategy),\" Derrick Kuzak, the company's global product chief, told Reuters at the show. gasoline. \"It is a major step forward in fuel saving and we are going across the board to promote technology,\" said Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of Daimler AG and Mercedes.

While the Court\u2019s power to choose its cases is a frequent subject of study, its practice of preselecting questions for review has received almost no attention. This is particularly surprising since the Court openly adds or subtracts questions in some of its most consequential and politicizing cases. Yet despite the significance of this practice, its origins are poorly understood. This Essay uncovers the hidden history of the Court\u2019s question-selection powers and reveals an important\u2014and possibly intractable\u2014conflict between the Court\u2019s legal authority and its practice.\nScholars usually explain the Court\u2019s agenda control as either a power granted by Congress or a natural component of the judicial power. Tracing the statutory, legislative, and common law histories, this Essay presents a novel challenge to these standard narratives. The Court\u2019s custom of targeting specific questions is not grounded in the history of appellate practice and Congress never intended to, and likely never did, give the Supreme Court the power to select its own questions. This history has profound repercussions for the Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. The question-selection power rests uneasily with both statutory law and Article III\u2019s \u201ccase or controversy\u201d requirement, risks doing fundamental injustice to litigants, and pulls the Court deeper into politics\u2014all of which put its legitimacy at risk. Abandoning this practice would almost certainly limit the Court\u2019s ability to answer hot-button political questions, but it might also help to preserve the Court\u2019s legitimacy.\nThe full text of this Essay can be found by clicking the PDF link to the left.", "kitchen corner base cabinet ideas 18 base cabinet best of kitchen corner cabinet ideas upper corner cabinet options corner cabinet dimensions medium size upper corner cabinet options upper corner kitchen cabinet ideas medium size of corner kitchen cabinet ideas.\nkitchen corner cabinet solutions corner kitchen cabinet ideas best kitchen corner cabinet solutions kitchen corner base cabinet solutions , corner kitchen cupboard outstanding great top corner kitchen cabinet corner kitchen cupboard kitchen cabinets corner shelf kitchen cabinet corner shelves corner base cabinet shelves kitchen , corner cabinet door bestfunnyvideosme corner cabinet door corner cabinet door corner cabinet door hinge lazy cabinet door hinges corner home, corner sink kitchen corner kitchen sink design kitchen corner sink corner , cabinet dividers kitchen lovely stand kitchen sink organizer n cabinet dividers kitchen lovely stand kitchen sink organizer n cabinet baking sheet organizer kitchen corner base cabinet organizer kitchen cabinet cutting , corner cabinet storage ideas corner cabinet ideas interior design corner cabinet storage ideas best corner cabinet storage ideas on corner regarding kitchen corner cabinet ideas , corner sink cabinet image of kitchen corner sink base cabinet design corner sink cabinet kitchen corner sink cabinet home design corner kitchen sink base cabinet home depot corner sink cabinet corner kitchen , kitchen corner storage cabinets solid wood kitchen cabinets lshaped corner base cabinet, kitchen kitchen corner units blind corner base cabinet dimensions medium size of kitchen corner kitchen cupboard ideas double bowl kitchen sink with drainboard kitchen sink, kitchen storage projects that create more space bpm collections kitchen storage projects that create more space bpm collections how too pinterest kitchen storage kitchen and kitchen cabinets, kitchen sink base cabinet design decorating interior of your house corner sink base cabinet kitchen remodeling with nice.", "This year's East Boston YMCA Summer Kick Off was a great event filled with smiles everywhere you looked. The kick off took place at Constitution Beach with a great view of Boston, Logan Airport and Boston Harbor. The kids were able to enjoy many games on the beach, swim and experience a touch tank full of bivalves brought by Save the Harbor / Save the Bay. I couldn't wait to show the kids what we had brought because everything we had was harmless and some of the best seafood's in my opinion. The touch tank marine life consisted of mussels, little neck clams, cherry stones, Quahog clams and oysters. The kids were very eager to touch all of the marine life that we had and learn what they are. There were a few kids who already knew what some of the bivalves were since their parent had given them seafood before. It was great to see that the bivalves were not completely foreign to the kids.\nThroughout the day we had fun participating in the dance events with kids. The DJ of the event did a great job and really kept the kids enthused with different dance games and songs that had choreography in the music such as the \"Cha Cha Slide\" and \"Cupid Shuffle.\" Being able to have fun with the kids and make their experience on the beach as fun as possible is something I love to do. Smashing opening a mussel so that that kids can see the inside is definitely something that gets them engaged just as much as dancing in a game of freeze dance.\n-Will Clark", "Harry Edward Carpenter, Sr. Harry Edward Carpenter, Sr., 80, of Culpeper passed away Friday, October 26, 2018 at Culpeper Health and Rehabilitation Center.

Our hosts, Dominique and Philippe, were welcoming and very helpful with suggestions for restaurants and day trips. This accommodation is close to the centre of town and a short walk to the beach. Our room consisted of a small bedroom area and a modern bathroom with shower. The bed was very comfortable for sleeping and, from the window, we not only had a view of the sea, but also cooling breezes every night. The room had AC but we never needed it. Breakfast was served beside the pool and consisted of good coffee, fruit, rolls/sweetbreads, ham, cheese, jams, honey & yoghurt. Very satisfactory for our needs. When we booked this place in spring, we were not aware that there were two other choices of accommodation at Casa Mar: a self catering full kitchen studio, with a balcony, and another suite, also with balcony. Our single room would be fine for a short stay, but for a longer time, we would recommend one of the other suites which would allow some seating (other than the bed), for reading or playing games or having a glass of wine and snacks.

The SCSC was founded in 1955 and officially incorporated in 1959 to support, educate, and provide a competitive environment for children and adults participating in equestrian sporting events. Our mission is to serve and develop a diverse group of equine and rodeo enthusiasts of all ages and abilities, and to provide families with fun equine activities. The key to accomplishing our mission is the ability to provide and continually improve the SCSC\u2019s arena facilities for these activities. SCSC\u2019s vision for the future is to repair and improve the facility enabling us to hold major equine and other events year-round. Bringing this vision to fruition will enable us to actively promote the facility for local and regional events fulfilling our mission to provide a safe environment for equine and other activities and to continue our successful 60-year history. Improvements to the facility will also provide an opportunity to host new events that the facility cannot currently accommodate. Hosting new regional events will also increase tourism in the local area and bring additional revenue opportunities to the entire community. The primary source of revenue for SCSC is generated through hosting events such as Little Britches Rodeos (Cedaredge boasts the longest running LBR in the nation), barrel race and roping competitions (for youth and adults) and gymkhanas (competitive events to help participants learn and improve their skills). In order to continue to host these types of events, SCSC needs funding for basic repairs to the livestock ramp/pens; the concession stand roof; the restroom facilities; the stairs/ramp to the announcer\u2019s booth and more.", "NNA - Maronite Patriarch, Cardinal Beshara Boutros Rahi, called on Lebanese officials to keep the judicial body away from the vicious circle of polarizations and political polemic. \"We insist on restoring rights, especially bank deposits. But what happened recently was contrary to judicial principles and legal rules, as it affected the prestige and respect of the judicial authority, which is the only one that guarantees the rights and freedoms of citizens in their disputes among themselves and in their differences with the authority and the state. We wonder with great concern about the event and its circumstances,\" the Patriarch said in his sermon, commenting on the recent events that took place in the judiciary. \"If our officials heard the voice of God in their conscience, and His voice through the suffering of the Lebanese citizens, 50% of whom became below the poverty level, while the middle class was above 80% of the people and constituted the pillar of its stability, and His voice through the collapse of the state with its institutions, economy, finances, and the livelihood of its people, they would have been formed the government, and began quickly with reforms and restoration of the port and reconstruction of Beirut, and stopped waste, and closed open and hidden smuggling crossings, and controlled the revenues of ports and the airport, and carried out basic and urgent reforms,\" Rahi went on.\nThe Patriarch also stressed the need to issue the ration card to needy families as a compensation for reconsidering the subsidy", "Scosche TA2113B In-dash Receiver Kit Fits select 2012-Up Toyota Yaris models \u2014 single-DIN or double-DIN radios for matching vehicles with all car stereos $119+ Zoom Front Photos Videos Does it fit my car?

Social work and social sciences review, 12 (3). pp. 40-56. ISSN 0953-5225\nThe past 11 years (1995-2006) have seen several major government initiatives in child welfare programmes culminating in the Children Act 2004 which places a duty on Children's Services and their relevant partners to 'cooperate to improve the well-being' of children. One of the most important vehicles of delivery is the establishment of a common assessment framework (CAF) (DfES, 2003) as a key recommendation of the Green Paper Every Child Matters (2003). It is believed that the implementation of the Framework will lead to a significant re-shaping of intervention practices and to a measurable improvement in the lives of children and families facing adversity of different kinds. The research presented in this article aims to address a fundamental problem which stands in the way of this initiative designed to standardize approaches to the assessment of need. The problem concerns the identification and categorization of matters which are currently being referred by different agents and agencies to children's services social care 'front-doors' as child protection matters. In the context of the findings of the first evaluation of the CAF and Lead Professional Guidance (DfEs, 2006) and the issues it raised over how 'thresholds' for services are being defined between partner agencies, the findings of research from the study being reported on this paper have implications for the reform of children's services in the UK and in other places where polices to improve the well being of children and young people are paramount.", ")USPS Parcel Select USPS Priority Mail USPS Priority Mail Express Express 1 (USPS)USPS Priority Mail USPS Priority Mail Express Canada Post Expedited Parcel Library Books Priority Regular Parcel Xpresspost Xpresspost Certified Fed Ex Fed Ex 1Day\u00ae Freight Fed Ex 2Day\u00aeFed Ex 2Day\u00ae A.

The spatial structure of environmental variation may vary among ecosystems, for instance due to differences in the flow of nutrients, genes and individuals. However, inferences about ecosystem spatial scale should also include spatial autocorrelation in environmental stochasticity, such as fluctuations in weather or climate. We used spatially structured time series (19-36 yr) on temperature from 4 different ecosystems (terrestrial, limnic, coastal sea and open ocean) to assess the spatiotemporal patterns of environmental variation over large geographical scales (up to 1900 km) during summer and winter. The distance of positive spatial autocorrelation in mean temperature was greatest for the terrestrial system (range: 592-622 km), and shorter for the open ocean (range: 472-414 km), coastal sea (range: 155-814 km) and the limnic systems (range: 51-324 km), suggesting a stronger spatial structure in environmental variation in the terrestrial system. The terrestrial system had high spatial synchrony in temperature (mean correlation: winter = 0.82, summer = 0.66) with a great spatial scaling (>650 km). Consequently, populations of terrestrial species experience similar environmental fluctuations even at distances up to 1000 km, compared to species in the aquatic systems (<500 km). There were clear seasonal differences in environmental synchrony in the terrestrial and limnic systems, but less so in the other systems. Our results suggest that biological processes affected by environmental stochasticity occur at the largest spatial scale in terrestrial systems, but their magnitude depends on whether the process is affected by winter or summer conditions.\nKEY WORDS: Ecosystem \u00b7 Synchrony \u00b7 Spatio-temporal autocorrelation \u00b7 Temperature \u00b7 Spatial scales \u00b7 Marine \u00b7 Terrestrial \u00b7 Limnic", "Some patients perceived aldara cream 5 their patents are.

Together, the two spaces form a key-shaped enclosure, originally lined entirely in box hedges. Beginning at the northern end of the Urn Terrace, the narrow Box Walk gradually descends a long, sloping hill to the Ellipse. Paths lead east and west from the Box Walk to nearby garden areas like the Pebble Garden, Cutting Garden, and Crabapple Hill. The walk terminates at the southern entrance to the Ellipse, where it is flanked by stone pineapples the Blisses purchased at Christies in 1957. Ruth Havey placed the pineapples there in 1967.\nFarrand imagined the walk as an informal all\u00e9e, lined with dwarf box between 3 and 5 feet high. Because the walkway leads down a significant incline, she carefully spaced steps and long landings to keep climbers from becoming fatigued. The stairway was originally constructed out of grass treads interspersed with stone risers, but sometime in the late 1940s the entire walk was paved. In 1959, Mildred Bliss had the steps refinished to match a diamond and ellipse paving design she\u2019d seen in a Gertrude Jekyll garden in Somerset, England earlier that year.\nThe Box Walk is still lined entirely in dwarf box bushes, although most of the original plants had to be replaced in the 1980s due to overgrowth and damage. Beatrix Farrand favored boxwood, and she used it heavily in her early designs, but the garden areas were replanted and updated over the years. Many of the bushes were removed to make for easier maintenance. The Box Walk is one of the only extensive box plantings that remain.", "the dup 10 and others 11\u2032And the worst part about it is that we created them.

Both use the successful MBX8 buggy as a base with the trucks featuring a new 3mm aluminium chassis for improved handling and consistency in bumpy conditions as well as improved overall steering thanks to greater stability. HTD high traction differentials come as standard, ensuring better acceleration, longer runtimes and more consistent handling especially in rougher track conditions. The larger oil volume ensures great consistency in long mains and improved traction in lower grip conditions. Part of the drivetrain package are also new straight-cut 10T bevel and 46T conical gears \u2013 again helping with acceleration, runtime and efficiency. The diffs are housed in new front and rear gearboxes that help to quicker extract the diffs from the chassis while new suspension hangers further help with maintenance and drivability. Also new in the suspension department are box-shaped suspension arms with arm stiffeners. They make for reduced flex while adding durability and optional inserts allow to fine-tune overall arm flex. Other new parts include a lightweight 1-piece wing mount for a lower centre of gravity with the wing mount being height adjustable to have additional control over downforce and jump characteristics. A lightweight high downforce wing helps with cornering and an updated carbon fibre radio plate \u2013 for the nitro kit \u2013 rounds out the package. The MBX8T trucks are decked out with Pro-Line body shells and they also include clamping servo saver nuts, updated front and rear shock towers as well as universal-type centre driveshafts.\nSource: Mugen [mugenseiki.com]", "The next big hunting extravaganza of the year - at least on my calendar - is the Houston Safari Club's 2010 Worldwide Hunting Expo & Convention, which is oddly enough, not held in Houston but in an outlying Master Planned Community known as The Woodlands.

To mitigate the European discrepancies and to alleviate some dangerous trends for the future should have an appropriate framework for the next steps.

In this context, the presentation defines the weaknesses of this area, starting from the history until present-day geopolitical situation.

Taking into account the human potential with its stock of intelligence, natural resources, the importance of the metropolis in the development of SEES, this space has the chance to become more competitive. At the same time, the opportunities created by the Danube Valley, the Mediteranean Sea and Black Sea constitute real premises to accelerate the development. Obviously, another huge opportunity is represented by the European Union countries, which serve as an axis for this space.

I am studying Lesson 5516. In Appendix A-5 in the back of the lesson there is a sample problem. It starts with a Boolean equation you are supposed to use to fill out a truth table. I don\u2019t know how to do this.\nA. Each term in the Boolean equation describes where ones are to be put in the output column of the truth table. For example, the first term in the equation is AB. This means that Whenever A is zero and B is one, there is a 1 in the output column, regardless of the states of C and D. So you put a 1 in the output columns where A, B, C, and D are 0100, 0101, 0110, and 0111. The next term is ABCD, with all the terms NOT-ed. This means that where A, B, C, and D are all zeros, we have a 1 in the output column. Only one line of the truth table meets this condition: the first one, where ABCD are 0000.\nThe next term is ABCD. So We put a 1 in the output column for 1111. In the last term we have A,B, C, D. This means that we put a 1 in the output column for 1011. Note that where there are four letters in a term, it refers to only one line in the truth table. Where there are three letters, two lines of the table will be involved. Where there are two letter, it refers to four lines of the truth table. If there is a one-letter term, eight lines will have a l in their output column.", "Madden's Mountain will be your next destination for your vacation stay anytime of year.

In the unlikely location of the basement of an old building near the corner of 8th and Spring, we have what might be the best Chinese food in downtown, including Chinatown. Now in one way saying that Peking Tavern is better than anything in Chinatown isn't necessarily that large of a compliment, since compared to the San Gabriel Valley, a comparison to Chinatown is setting the bar kind of low. Also the main fare at Peking Tavern is dumplings and other types of eats that off the top of my head can't be found in Chinatown, so technically there's nothing in Chinatown to compare it to. On the other hand, given that during its soft opening Peking Tavern is crowded with locals and hipsters, it's surprising to find food this good being served to that audience. We tried the pork dumplings, the juicy beef dumplings, the pumpkin shrimp dumplings, plus a combo salad. Everything was excellent, and the dumpling wrappers were great. The pumpkin shrimp dumplings may sound odd, but the sweetness and texture of the pumpkin works well. Of course, Peking Tavern is in its soft opening period, the menu is evolving, so things could change. But at this point things are very encouraging. Peking Tavern is at 806 S. Spring, adjacent to the garment district.", "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a reaction to trauma that results in a chronic perception of threat, precipitating mobilization of the autonomic nervous system, and may be reflected by chronic disinhibition of limbic structures. A common injury preceding PTSD in veterans is mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). This may be due to the vulnerability of white matter in these networks and such damage may affect treatment response. We evaluated transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS), a non-invasive, low-risk approach that may alter the functions of the limbo-cortical and peripheral networks underlying the hyperarousal component of PTSD and thus improve patient health and well-being. In this single visit pilot study evaluating the impact of tVNS in 22 combat veterans, we used a between-subjects design in people with either PTSD with preceding mTBI or healthy controls. Participants were randomized into stimulation or sham groups and completed a posturally modulated autonomic assessment and emotionally modulated startle paradigm. The primary measures used were respiratory sinus arrhythmia (high-frequency heart rate variability) during a tilt-table procedure derived from an electrocardiogram, and skin conductance changes in response to acoustic startle while viewing emotional images (International Affective Picture System). The stimulation was well tolerated and resulted in improvements in vagal tone and moderation of autonomic response to startle, consistent with modulation of autonomic state and response to stress in this population. Our results suggest that tVNS affects systems underlying emotional dysregulation in this population and, therefore, should be further evaluated and developed as a potential treatment tool for these patients.\nKeywords: autonomic; hyperarousal; posttraumatic stress disorder; sympathetic; transcutaneous; transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation; traumatic brain injury; vagal.", "New England Fishery Management Council; Public Meeting, 27228-27229 [E6-7112]Download as PDF\nAgencies\n[Federal Register Volume 71, Number 90 (Wednesday, May 10, 2006)] [Notices] [Pages 27228-27229] From the Federal Register Online via the Government Printing Office [] [FR Doc No: E6-7112] ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [I.D. 050306C] New England Fishery Management Council; Public Meeting AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.

It's clear that the Executive Office of the President has been focused on other policy issues for the last three-plus years, leaving it to the space-based congressional delegations such as Texas to fill the void in leadership. The most recent example of this was the bipartisan push-back on the administration's space policy a few years ago, leading to the crafting of the Space Launch System through the actions of (now retired) Senator Hutchinson (R-TX) and Senator Nelson (D-FL). With some of the recent refinements in space policy failing to gain traction (read: Asteroid Redirect or Retrieval Mission, the R depending on your choice of the day), and continuing budgetary pressures putting the squeeze on NASA's funding, one has to wonder whether the failings of the Texas delegation to effectively lead across the board will make the situation worse for human spaceflight.", "Best Internet Marketing Techniques Search Engine Submission: Search engine submission is the first and foremost step to evolvement is evident from the very introduction of search engine optimization SEO on the web.

In 1Q14 service revenue, excluding interconnection, was stable quarter-on-quarter but dropped 1.8% year-on-year, at THB28.967 billion, as the cellco said that Thailand\u2019s escalating political tension during the quarter led to slower consumer spending, reflected by a contraction in voice service turnover of 12% y-o-y and 4.9% q-o-q as well as a slowdown in device units sold.

Every Thanksgiving liberals (for some reason only liberals?) get lectured on how we're supposed to be nice to our conservative family members. But Chuck Schumer, for all his flaws, isn't actively trying to ensure that women die, and those annoying Thanksgiving liberals aren't actually questioning the basic humanity of much of the US population. My point is these are basically bad people in a way that can't be covered up in the age of Trump and Kavanaugh.\nAnd, really, they are bad people. If conservatives want to think all liberals are bad people because we are baby killers... fine.

All the measurement sites were naturally ventilated and were occupied during the campaigns by permanent residents or for certain time periods by the technical staff responsible for the instrumentation. Outdoor particle number (PN) concentrations presented the higher values in Milan and Athens (median values 1.4 \u00d7 104 # cm\u20133 and 2.9 \u00d7 104 # cm\u20133 respectively) as a result of elevated outdoor emissions and led to correspondingly higher indoor values compared to Oslo and Prague. In absence of indoor activities, the indoor concentrations followed the fluctuations of the outdoor concentrations in all the measurement sites. Indoor activities (cooking, smoking, etc.) resulted in elevated indoor PN concentrations (maximum values ranging between 1.7 \u00d7 105 # cm\u20133 and 3.2 \u00d7 105 # cm\u20133) and to I/O ratios higher than one. The I/O ratios were size dependant and for periods without indoor activities, they presented the lowest values for particles < 50 nm (0.51 \u00b1 0.15) and the ratios increased with fine particle size (0.79 \u00b1 0.12 for particles between 100\u2013200 nm). The analysis of the modal structure showed that the indoor aerosol size distribution characteristics differ from the outdoors under the effect of indoor sources. The percentage of unimodal size distributions increased during indoor emissions, compared to periods without indoor sources, along with the number concentration of Aitken mode particles, indicating emissions in specific size ranges according to the type of the indoor source.", "Experimentation versus contemplation\nI\u2019ve noticed a growing trend in questions from clients that has helped me to a clarifying revelation.

I payed $899 including shipping, and I received the bass within 4 days of ordering it. When I opened the package, I was somewhat surprised by how visually striking the ash body was. Not in a gaudy kind of way, but the grain was more apparent then I'm used to seeing in swamp ash. It is also the lightest 5-string bass I have ever held. Before plugging it in, I plucked a few notes acoustically and noticed that the strings were quite dead. The bass must have been played in the shop quite a bit. Also, the neck had a bit too much relief. After adjusting the truss rod, I plugged the bass in. The first thing that came to mind is how resonant the bass is. The body just resonates like crazy when you pluck a note. Also, the neck is the thinnest, most comfortable neck I have ever owned(I have owned approximately 35 basses over the years). While the lows sounded very big and natural, the highs were muted due to the dead strings. That evening I drove out to my studio and purchased some Ken Smith stainless steel strings. After putting them on, the highs really opened up on the bass. The phenolic fingerboard really gives the bass some bite like a Pedulla Buzz bass, but the overall decay and tone is very different. Much more acoustical with a more natural low end. Last night I used it on a gospel gig, and the bass sounded really big but stayed super tight, including the B-string. The bass also balances extremely well. So far I am quite pleased with this instrument.", "It is well known that the story is literally a country rich with oddities and interesting facts.

President) When a surface-breaking feature in a plastic encapsulated microcircuit (PEM), such as a lead finger or tie bar, is delaminated, water can enter along the delaminated interface during the course of the scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) inspection. When this occurs, the delamination often becomes obscured in the SAM image. The reason is that as water fills the delaminated interface between the mold compound and the feature of interest, the water provides acoustic coupling across the gap. Instead of reflecting the entire acoustic signal as an air filled delamination would, the water permits transmission of a portion of the acoustic signal. In many cases, this can completely obscure the delamination in the SAM image. This phenomenon is categorized by JEDEC J-STD-035, Acoustic Microscopy for Nonhermetic Encapsulated Electronic Components, as a Potential Image Pitfall in Annex B. /> /> The images show the effect of water ingress during scanning of a group of 8-pin SOIC devices. The image on the left shows the original scan. Areas of lead finger delamination are identified by the arrows. The image on the right shows a second scan obtained less than two minutes after the first. Note that the delamination is no longer visible at three of the lead fingers. This effect can be seen in real-time on a different group of parts in the video below. Also, be sure to check back for PART II of this blog on water ingress to learn what steps AcousTech suggests to help deal with this issue.", "You are here: Home > Course > Desserts > Cakes > Sesame Seed Cake Squares Sesame Seed Cake Squaresby Foodie #627191 24 Jan 2015 You are not signed in.

With the BIZNOVATOR Programs, our students master numerous skills, and begin to develop mindsets that can impact them positively throughout their lives. However, we also realize that many young people still lack developmental maturity to grasp the importance of good decision making and their impact on behavioral outcomes. Today, parents are faced with the overwhelming influences of social media, fast paced tech games, and the overall impact technology has on this \u201cDigital Native\u201d generation. While Generation Z students are considered to be the most connected generation in history, recent studies also prove that they are also the loneliest generation (findings from Cigna Insurance\u2019s Gen Z research). For this reason, and many others, BIZNOVATOR believes that todays\u2019 youth need consistent inputs into their personal growth and life coaching.\nFor years, BIZNOVATOR has been committed 100% to assist and teach youth to Discover their purpose, Transform their mindset, and Connect to their future while learning to maximize the resources and opportunities around them. For that reason, BIZNOVATOR has developed a monthly Coaching Program whereby Certified BIZNOVATOR Trainers can provide 1\u00d71 coaching to young people all over the world.

It was cold at the start - I was in 3 layers including a waterproof jacket as it had just started to rain and looked threatening weather to come. But the steep uphill at the start warms you up quick and soon runners were spreading out. Pretty slick on the roots on the technical downhills - lots of runners came across the finish line with scrapes from falls though I think all of Team Montrail were fine! Course was marked great - plenty of flagging and awesome volunteers cheering on and providing aid. Up the power line the grey skies, sleet falling and bracken reminded me more of Scotland than Vancouver :) I ran with Ryne for a bit, gaining and losing on each other as we stopped at aid stations etc. Gary must have gained on Aaron (winner) in the last half as after the turn arond where you cross paths with runners ahead Aaron was further ahead. I knew from this point that I was a comfortable distance ahead of the 2nd place woman so could relax and enjoy the run more! (esp seen as Suzanne Evans wasn't competing this year!). Trails in pretty good condition - no snow and not too muddy given the dryish week before. I was glad to knock 10mins of my course PB of 3 years ago. Brightened up to enjoy the BBQ and awards after.

Both austenitic stainless steel and nickel-based filler metals were used in welds. On as-welded specimens a sharp change of hardness in low-alloy steel has been measured, with increasing distance from weld metal; the hardness values have been related to the observed metallographic constituents. On post-weld heat treated specimens, the behaviour is different according to the composition of filler material, either austenitic steel or nickel-based alloy. In the case of austenitic filler material, a dark-etching narrow diffusion region of carbon toward weld metal is formed, with an adjacent markedly decarburized zone, exhibiting the minimum microhardness values in a narrow band of about 60 micrometres. Since this sharp structural variation is recorded just in the zone where often failures occur, the final post-weld heat treatment appears to be proposed with due caution. In the case of nickel-based filler material, carbon diffusion is inhibited by the precipitation of alloy carbides at the weld interface. This determines a more homogeneous heat affected zone (HAZ) in the ferritic steel and a reduced decarburization near the fusion line after a post-weld heat treatment, confirming the reasons of the preference recognized to this filler material, especially when service temperature is elevated and submitted to frequent changes, or whenever a post-welded heat treatment is required.", "How Banqer is used in my class\nHi have a Y7/8 class and I use it for a wide range of things. Banqer dollars are handed out as rewards for being on task, completing work, great behaviour etc. I deposit the money throughout the day for them. They also get paid for doing jobs around the class. They went through the unit on incomes and careers and applied for jobs. Bonuses are given to those who do their jobs consistently and others are asked to resign when they don't. Students get paid each day they are at school which we discussed it to be the minimum wage. Each week they are charged expenses which covers photocopying, electricity, resources, water, etc. This is set up as an automatic payment and the attendance payment I calculate on a Friday using a tracking sheet I mark off attendance each day. Over the holidays I work out an average weekly payment and I pay students for public holidays. Their weekly expenses comes out regardless of whether they have attended school or not and also comes out over the holidays. So it teaches them about budgeting too. We also have a challenge each term where the student with the most money in their savings account wins a (Wendy's) lunch. This helps them think about where to have their money and gets them a good look into interest. We are going to get into property next term now they have a reasonable amount of money and will continue the savings challenge. I'm really enjoying it and my class love it too.", "Dreaming of Summer ..... Greetings from a very moist Northern California Coast. The studio is buzzing with classes and a KAL and the bright spot in all the rain and swollen rivers has been the actual SWEATER knitting weather we have had. It feels really great to wear some of our projects - past and present - in this rather extended reminder that sometimes we do still have winter after all the drought years without it. The atmospheric rivers have swept me into summer daydreams and anticipation for the remarkable Norah Gaughan Retreat on August 9-12, 2019. This event\u2019s focus on Nature\u2019s Shapes and Colors provides a unique opportunity to be engaged with our teachers, Norah and Emily, in an environment that inspires them in their work. Our home base is the Marshall Wall, on the eastern shore of Tomales Bay overlooking the northern peninsula of the Point Reyes National Seashore. We will use our location at Marconi State Park to explore the beaches and trails in the area making observations of natural shape and color and how that translates into knitwear design. We are very fortunate to be sponsored by Brooklyn Tweed for the yarns we will work with at this Retreat. Arbor and Peerie are bringing their rich palette to our needles and it will be a special treat to have Norah and Emily introducing us to these materials.You can find all the details here and don\u2019t hesitate to ask for more information if you need it!Your summer plans should include joining us for this magical weekend in Point Reyes.

In this paper, we prove that a similar result holds for an almost alpha n-regular graphGwith any alpha>0 and a collection of bounded degree trees on at most (1-o(1))nvertices ifGdoes not contain large bipartite holes. This result is sharp in the sense that it is necessary to exclude large bipartite holes and we cannot hope for an approximate decomposition inton-vertex trees. Moreover, this implies that for any alpha>0 and ann-vertex almost alpha n-regular graphG, with high probability, the randomly perturbed graphG?G(n,O(1n))has an approximate decomposition into all collections of bounded degree trees of size at most (1-o(1))nsimultaneously. This is the first result considering an approximate decomposition problem in the context of Ramsey-Turan theory and the randomly perturbed graph model. 2020-08-01T00:00:00Z", "Social Dilemma-Is It Okay to Be On the Phone When Paying at the Register?\nToday's social dilemma came from Kurly.

All day every day my crew and I see customers come to the counter talking or texting on their cells...I find this to be one of the most disrespectful things one human can do to another...if I were to do it to them, they would not appreciate it. Yet sooooo many of them do it to us, so apparently this behavior is acceptable...lastly, I know the big reply will be how important the phone call is, but to me that doesn't matter...disrespect is disrespect....if the phone call is that important, remove yourself to privacy and take care of it.....your thoughts? Thanks so much Jaime ~ Kurly It does seem that this happens more and more. I see it all the time. I do admit that I've gotten a text while in line and I'll pull out my phone and look at it, but I always say excuse me, and as soon as I know it's not an emergency, I put it back.

Dim Sum is largely a collection of steamed and fried rolls with meat and veggies inside. There are other Dim Sum dishes, but many Dim Sum dishes appear to be similar color and sizes on the outside - but the insides are filled with yummy meats, veggies or sweets. There are a number of good Dim Sum restaurants around the island, and this food is best eaten with friends, because each dish may have 6-12 pieces of Dim Sum. If there are just two of you, go early in the afternoon and take the extra food back to the hotel room. Dim Sum is not expensive, but it is wonderful. The other cuisine that you cannot miss in Hong Kong is Indian food. I recommend eating in the SOHO area and in Lan Kwai Fong. You will have a great place to party afterwards, and the surroundings are a journal entry that you will never forget.\nOne word about the music. Hong Kong does have some of its own musical personalities, but many of the bands here are actually from the Philippines.

The popular sandy beaches of Kalamitsa, Toska and Batis are perfect for sunbathing and swimming. Holidays in Kavala are particularly popular with families due to the gently sloping sands and safe, calm waters. Beach activities include jet skiing, sailing and fishing. The busy waterfront is lined with shops, bars and restaurants. Those seeking a little more seclusion can head to the beaches of Iraklitsa or Permos.\nKavala's old town 'Panagia' is a maze of narrow lanes dotted with 18th and 19th-century buildings and pastel-coloured houses. Well worth a visit is the Archaeological Museum with its displays of ancient Neapolis, and the Municipal Folklore Museum, housed in a 19th-century building, with its collections of ancient jewellery, handicrafts and costumes. Other points of interest include the lighthouse, with its magnificent views over the town, the 5th-century castle and tower, and the remains of an Ottoman aqueduct, which overlooks the harbour.\nKavala looks out towards the lush, green island of Thasos, one of the most picturesque Greek islands. Tourists can take a hydrofoil over to Thasos, a 40-minute journey, to explore the beautiful island. Holidays in Kavala are also popular with outdoor-enthusiasts. The hiking trails on Mount Pangaion feature forested slopes, towering oak trees and freshwater springs. Nine miles away is Philippi City, which is an archaeological site dating back to 359 BC.

The change this week is that instead of directing the energy flow with the breath each time, this week we will intentionally start the energy flow, perhaps using the breath to begin with and then continue the flow without continuing to drive it with the breath. We will just breathe normal deep relaxed breaths while the flow continues.\nFor example in posture four, with the hands separate in front, when our hands are in position, we may find that as we set our intention of drawing energy in through one hand and out through the other, that the energy just naturally does this as it is something we have already practiced. If it doesn\u2019t we might use a breath for a few repetitions to start the flow, breathing in as we focus on drawing energy through one hand and breathing out as we focus on sending energy out through the other. Once the flow has started we can just see if we can maintain a continuous flow in through one hand and out through the other at the same time, without this being tied to the breath. If necessary we can use the breath again to keep the flow going. We will then change the direction of flow as we did in the previous week.\nThese practices are important preparation for using qigong ability in healing and martial arts.", "Description\nDutch neo progressive masters Silhouette return with their fifth studio album. It contains six songs with a total playing time of nearly 50 minutes. The 18 minute long epic \u201cBitter Sweet Memories Suite\u201d, consisting of five parts, is the longest song ever written by the band. The album is unusually diverse and adventurous. While still recognizably Silhouette, this musical journey contains influences of not only the founding fathers of progressive rock, but also of contemporary, modern acts. We won\u2019t tell you which ones, you will have to discover for yourself! What we can tell you is that this artistic evolution is obviously due to the growing influence of the younger members of the band, who were more actively involved in the writing and arranging than on previous Silhouette albums.\nWhile The World is Flat is not a concept album like the previous one,. Things that should matter don\u2019t seem to matter anymore in public life. Sometimes we feel the strength to stand up against these modern demons. But sometimes we don\u2019t, we cannot take it anymore and we give in to the desire to turn our backs to the flat world. We start searching for existential depth in our private lives, behind the protection of closed blinds in our homes. That is when we discover in the end it is all about living the moment, in the here and now. But also we find that even the most beautiful moments and memories have no meaning unless you can share them with your loved ones.", "Paranormal Activity 2 took in an estimated $41.5 million for its debut weekend, the highest ever for a horror film not accounting for ticket price inflation, immediately making it a viable franchise for Paramount Pictures. The Studios may now well look to creating annual installments based on its success, as Lionsgate has done with its low budget phenomenon, Saw. Creating a viable sequel for Paranormal Activity was no easy move for Paramount as the studio attempted to replicate the commercial success of a film made independently for just $15,000 that turned into a box office blockbuster last year based almost entirely on word of mouth and Internet advertising. Remember Blair witch 2.\nFor the sequel, the studio couldn\u2019t again build buzz through stealth late-night screenings since audiences were now.\nUltimately Paramount did an effective job. In a series such as this it was no easy task, creating an interesting, relevant and just as engaging storyline as the original without repetition or relying on clich\u00e9 was no walk in the park. The original\u2019s strengths were not easy to replicate without the danger of over familiarizing the audience with the same box of tricks. But Paranormal Activity 2 was very engaging, maybe not as much as the original but it was certainly close. You can expect the same \u201cshock factor\" as its predecessor, the same tension laden direction pulling in the audience. Its faults are minimal, my main complaint with the original being the overtly out of context ending finds its way back into the sequel.

Cheers, Karolin -- Samba SerNet sambaXP", "Gentamicin, a widely used aminoglycoside antibiotic, is concentrated in lysosomes of proximal tubular cells of the kidney, and induces therein an accumulation of myelin-like material. We show that treatment of rats with Gentamicin (10 mg/kg, 7 days) induces a loss of activity of lysosomal sphingomyelinase and phospholipase A1, associated with an increase in the amount of total lipid phosphorus in the kidney cortex. In vitro, Gentamicin is shown by gel permeation to bind to phospholipid bilayers (liposomes) under conditions which mimic the lysosomal environment (acid pH and presence of phosphatidylinositol). The reversal of this binding by an increase in the ionic strength (less than 0.04) suggests electrostatic interaction between the hydrophilic, polycationic aminoglycoside and the negatively charged phospholipids. Binding of Gentamicin impairs the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine present in the bilayer, by lysosomal phospholipases A1 and A2 from the liver or kidney. We also show that lysosomal sphingomyelinase is readily and irreversibly inactivated by liposomes in the absence of detergent. The lysosomal phospholipidosis induced by Gentamicin in the kidney, as in cultured cells [Aubert-Tulkens et al., Lab. Invest. 40, 481 (1979)] appears therefore to be a direct consequence of the lysosomotropic character of this drug and its ability to inhibit therein phospholipid breakdown. Amikacin, a semi-synthetic aminoglycoside, binds more loosely to phospholipid bilayers, induces less inhibition of phospholipases in vitro and is less taken up by tubular cells in vivo. Accordingly, Amikacin does not provoke significant lysosomal phospholipidosis or loss of sphingomyelinase and phospholipase A1 activities in vivo at the doses and time investigated (0-40 mg/kg, 7 days). Inasmuch as Amikacin is reported to be less toxic to the kidney, we suggest that lysosomal alterations are an early and significant step in aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity.", ". and go on 4 years and 5 albums. In addition to that they also wrote and performed two soundtrack albums for two directors very early in their careers, Woody Allen \"Whats Up Tigerlily\" and Francis Ford Coppola \"You're a Big Boy Now.\"They toured almost constantly during this period and were one of the first rock bands to perform on college campuses almost as much as for teenage concert goers.\nIn 1967 Zal Yanovsky left the band to pursue a solo career and was replaced by Jerry Yester, a member of the Modern Folk Quartet and friend of the band since its earliest days. All of the band's energy was soon focused on recording their fourth album the very ambitious Everything Playing. It was the first attempt for a rock band to record an album on the new Ampex 16 track tape recorder and quite a challenge it was. It was worth the effort however, producing hits like \"Darlin' Be Home Soon,\" \"Six O-Clock\" and \"She's Still A Mystery To Me\" on the American charts and \"Boredom\" and \"Money\" in the UK and Europe.\nIn June 1968 John Sebastian left the band to go solo and Joe, Steve and Jerry went back into the studio to record what would be their last hit single of the 1960's, \"Never Goin' Back\" with legendary Nashville session player Red Rhodes on pedal steel guitar.

International Journal of Care Scholars (IJCS), 3 (1). pp. 3-10. ISSN 2600-898X\nAbstract\nObjective: In Malaysia, sexual health issues among young people encompassing premarital sex, the incidence of STI including HIV/AIDS, unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion and the practice of baby abandonment. Little is known about the provision of sexual health care for young people since it has not been examined in-depth in a Malaysian context. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of healthcare professionals who deliver sexual health services provision to young people within primary healthcare settings which included schools as part of an outreach programme. Methods: This qualitative study used a self-developed topic guide for in-depth interview with twenty-four healthcare professionals of several government health clinics in Malaysia. The aim was to understand healthcare professionals\u2019 experiences of dealing with young people and their views on current sexual health services provision. The interview data were entered into Nvivo and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: The findings show that healthcare professionals regarded the use of the Adolescent Health Screening Form as a cornerstone for all initial interactions between and young people in health clinics. The findings also highlight the problem with an appointment system that includes lack of consultation times, privacy issues and the requirement of parental consent when dealing with unmarried young people. Conclusion: This study had recognized several facility-based obstacles that restricted sexual health services to young people in Malaysia. Their access to and the utilization of sexual health services are dependent on health care system improvement.", ".

Quite a few of his short stories and even some of his novels revolve around the holiday, and many more tales are evocative of that autumnal chill in the air. And so, whether that autumnal chill is present or not, today\u2019s vintage spotlight turns to Bradbury\u2019s seminal short story collection, \u2018The October Country.\u2019\nRay was at home in various genres, but if you dig his weirder, more macabre tendencies, this is the volume for you. Malevolent winds, mysterious upstairs neighbors, supernatural families, and a lethal newborn are all found here. The dark vibe is to be expected, considering these stories originated in the pages of pulp magazines like \u2018Weird Tales\u2019. Beautifully written, they may not be among Ray\u2019s most respected work, but they\u2019re typical of his boundless imagination and frequently unsettling. This is one of his earliest collections, published in 1955, and in truth is mostly a repackaging (with some revisions) of tales from \u2018Dark Carnival\u2019, his very first book, which was released under August Derleth and Donald Wandrei\u2019s small press publishing venture, Arkham House.\nFor me, Bradbury was a gateway author. In his short story \u2018The Exiles\u2019 (found, among other places, in his excellent collection \u2018The Illustrated Man\u2019), he name-drops authors I had never heard of at the time: Bierce, Blackwood, Lovecraft, Asquith. This single tale sent me in new directions, searching for the creators that Bradbury respected, and finding an entirely new and ever-widening world of strange fiction that I still explore today.

One particularly memorable cliffhanger took place at the end of season two when Mandy appears out of nowhere to give President Palmer a poisoned handshake, but for the sake of this article we are fast forwarding to one that took place at the end of season five. This already dramatic season came to a shocking and bleak conclusion, with Jack being tracked down and captured by the Chinese government who has discovered that he is still alive. We then see a bound and beaten Jack being transferred aboard a cargo ship to Shanghai. We know that he is about to be brutally tortured, and possibly even killed.

On 26 October 2011, a provincial council decided to close the station on the grounds that its programmes contained music which was \u201ccontrary to local morality\u201d. Ahmed Al-Qasier, founder and manager of the station in the provincial capital Diwaniyya, south of Baghdad, said its programmes were composed of songs from the classical Arabic repertoire. This month, several of the station\u2019s contributors received anonymous threats on their mobile phones. Several members of the editorial staff, including programme director Muntather Al-Kifaey, decided to resign. This was reported by Reporters Without Borders and IFEX on 29 October 2011. Reporters Without Borders urges the authorities in Diwaniyya to put a halt to the persecution of Al-Sada staff. The organisation recalls that freedom of the press is guaranteed by the Iraqi constitution and has been reaffirmed in the law on protection of journalists approved by parliament in August. It also asks the governor to reconsider his decision and allow the radio station to continue broadcasting and guarantee the safety of its staff.

During the day, visitors were able to immerse themselves in the world of glaciology and climate change, view award-winning documentaries on a huge outdoor cinema screen and talk to scientists who were conducting experiments and telling stories of conducting fieldwork in some of the most remote and coldest places on the planet. The event was organised by masters students from Durham Univeristy led by David Saddington and was sponsored by the Natural Environment Research Council. They did a fantastic job of pulling the events together and represent a great example as to how students can get involved in science communication.\nThe debate itself featured four panelists alongside myself: Professor Chris Stokes of the Department of Geography at Durham University, an expert in glaciers and glaciation, environmental remote sensing, and communicating science; Alice L\u00e9pissier , a research associate at the Centre for Global Development, currently working on SkyShares a tool to help policy-makers compute the economic costs of international climate change agreements; Jonathan Elmer, an ecological consultant and member of the Durham Green Party and Ignacio Mart\u00ed, the Innovation and Research Director for Offshore Renewable Energies Catapult.

However, in Malaysia and elsewhere, most EC users also smoke conventional cigarettes (CCs). We aimed to investigate nicotine cessation for both ECs and CCs. Additionally, safety issues among sole EC and dual (EC and CC) users over a six-month period were reported. Methods: We observed 218 sole Malaysian EC and dual users over 6 months from June 2015 to November 2015. Both groups underwent exhaled breath carbon monoxide and saliva cotinine analyses to verify their nicotine cessation from both EC and CC use. Adverse events and withdrawal symptoms were assessed based on self-reports. Results: Only 3.3% of observed users quit both ECs and CCs, whereas 20.5% quit smoking CCs. Quitting ECs and CCs was significantly higher among sole EC users (5 vs 2, respectively; OR: 5.62; P = 0.036) than it was among dual users, a result that was similar for CCs smoking (29 vs. 15; OR: 6.33; P \u2264 0.001). No severe health issues were reported over the entire study period. Conclusion: The rates of quitting CCs and ECs were higher in sole EC users than those in dual users. No serious health effects were reported over 6 months in either group. ECs may serve as a smoking cessation aid in Malaysia, but appropriate regulations are necessary to encourage sole EC use to ensure product quality. Large randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with a longer follow-up are required to better measure the effectiveness and safety of ECs use alone and in combination with CCs", "Hoverboards are not allowed at CES It\u2019s a little inside baseball, but if you\u2019re one of the many journalists, vendors, tech enthusiasts, or fitness fans heading to Las Vegas next month for CES, you know that the convention is never short on newfangled things to look at, blinking gadgets, and all sorts of other wacky stuff that may or may not ever come to fruition. It\u2019s rare to find a product category that isn\u2019t covered at CES. And while you\u2019re sure to see all kinds of \u201choverboards\u201d on display at the convention, don\u2019t expect to see any geeks (or savvy members of the press who are tired of getting sore feet each year) whizzing by. \u201cWheeled transport devices (with or without motors) are not permitted at any CES venue.

That said, we fully expect there to be quite a few smart people thinking they can just roll into CES with their light-sparkling hoverboards.

However, the methodological development of a spatiotemporally controllable investigation of the damage events in myocardial infarction remains challengeable. In the present study, we describe a micropillar array-aided tissue interface mimicking microfluidic device for the dynamic study of hypoxia-induced myocardial injury in a microenvironment-controllable manner. The mass distribution in the device was visually characterized, calculated, and systematically evaluated using the micropillar-assisted biomimetic interface, physiologically relevant flows, and multitype transportation. The fluidic microenvironment in the specifically functional chamber for cell positioning and analysis was successfully constructed with high fluidic relevance to the myocardial tissue. We also performed a microenvironment-controlled microfluidic cultivation of myocardial cells with high viability and regular structure integration. Using the well-established culture device with a tissue-mimicking microenvironment, a further on-chip investigation of hypoxia-induced myocardial injury was carried out and the varying apoptotic responses of myocardial cells were temporally monitored and measured. The results show that the hypoxia directionally resulted in observable cell shrinkage, disintegration of the cytoskeleton, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and obvious activation of caspase-3, which indicates its significant apoptosis effect on myocardial cells. We believe this microfluidic device can be suitable for temporal investigations of cell activities and responses in myocardial infarction. It is also potentially valuable to the microcontrol development of tissue-simulated studies of multiple clinical organ/tissue disease dynamics.", "File:Bioenergy.jpg|thumb|The Status meter from Deus Ex.

Participants completed a VO2max trial and on a 400 m track, three 3,200 m time trials. During three subsequent sessions, participants completed 800 m warm-up; then, based on their fastest 3,200 m steady pace, subjects completed six laps total at three prescribed paces: (a) 2\u00d7 400 m at 7% slower than steady pace (SLO), (b) 2\u00d7 400 m at steady pace (AT) and (c) 2\u00d7 400 m at 7% faster than steady pace (FAS). Instructions were to complete the sets of two laps in prescribed times (e.g., 75 s per 400 m) (no feedback). Deviation scores (absolute value of difference: prescribed vs. actual time) (s) for each 400 m lap were compared using a 2 (group) \u00d7 3 (trial) repeated measures ANOVA. Main effects for deviations among trials SLO (7.3 \u00b1 6.5), AT (6.6 \u00b1 6.9) and FAS (6.2 \u00b1 5.7) were not significantly different (p > 0.05). However, group main effect for deviation scores was significantly (p < 0.05) lower (greater accuracy) for COL (2.9 \u00b1 3.2 s) versus REC (9.5 \u00b1 6.6 s). Deviation scores were also significantly different (p < 0.05) for SLO (COL: 3.1 \u00b1 2.7 s, REC: 10.4 \u00b1 6.7 s) and AT (COL: 1.9 \u00b1 1.9 s, REC: 10.1 \u00b1 7.2 s), with a trend for FAS (p = 0.06) (COL: 3.8 \u00b1 4.3 s, REC: 7.9 \u00b1 6.1 s).

They\u2019re able to also start using these heaters to spend less the rest of the winter season also.\nA baseboard heater is excellent for heating a small room and also is typically easy to install. A homeowner could utilize them when it\u2019s not really cold enough in order to rationalize using the heating unit for the complete home, but they nonetheless want to make certain their particular master bedroom is a comfy temperature throughout the night. A house owner could also need to utilize them along with a programmable thermostat if it is colder later on in the season. They could lower the temperature on their thermostat during the night so they do not use as much electricity as well as merely keep the space they\u2019re in cozy with the baseboard heater. This tends to help slash power bills and they are able to program the thermostat to make the remainder of the residence warm shortly before they get up in the morning.\nIn case you are seeking an even more efficient solution to heat your property, have a look at the baseboard heaters and just how they\u2019re able to help you to save money.

Though the sex scenes reveal the publisher's Harlequin background.\nThis is book 1 of the AFTERTIME series. In this post-apocalyptic world, global famine and massive terrorist attacks have destroyed civilization as we know it. The electrical grid is down, water systems have been destroyed, and communication networks are a thing of the past. Bioterrorism has killed most of the world's vegetation and animals, leaving the surviving humans to exist on a diet of Kaysev, a laboratory-created plant that provides the bare essentials necessary to maintain life. In its last official act, the U.S. government sent Air Force planes to blanket the entire country with Kaysev seeds so that the population would not starve to death. Unfortunately, due to either ineptitude or sabotage, a poisonous seed\u2014blue leaf\u2014was mixed in with the Kaysev seeds, and people who eat blue leaf turn into zombiesque, flesh-eating monsters called Beaters. The story follows Cass Dollar, a recovering addict who is searching for her young daughter, who disappeared after Cass was attacked by the Beaters\u2014and (incredibly) survived in normal human form. Although this is a very dark series, I am enjoying it for its fresh and inventive take on post-apocalyptic times. The Kaysev concept is great\u2014and very well thought out. The seed mix-up seems like a plausible bureaucratic snafu, and I can convince myself that it really could happen. Also interesting are the three different societies that are portrayed: the downtrodden but independent survivors living in the Box, the resilient but fanatical extremists of the Convent, and the burgeoning but oppressive new society of the rebuilders.

Beneficial Brick began as a street art fundraising project in 1999 and it now attracts over 40,000 people per year. This is not surprising to us here at The Chromologist \u2013 the whole idea revolves around purchasing a simple brick, grabbing a paint pot and brush then painting your brick however you\u2019d like to before adding it to one of the several brick stands scattered around the Czech Republic. The main one is in the city centre of Prague, on Na Prikope.\nAt each of the stands the paint and brushes are provided so it\u2019s only up to you to bring an idea. Some bricks have been decorated with political statements and the occasional brick is shuffled to another spot if its placement seems deliberately intended to incite abrasion between people, but mostly the bricks are decorated as flags, or in inspiring (or not so inspiring) patterns, statements of love and positive slogans or suggestions \u2013 a shout out now to the designer of \u201cUnicorns are real\u201d and their fitting choice of a rainbow background.\nThe brick painting takes place between May and October and in the 18 years since the project began, Beneficial Brick has provided finance to around 26 social care facilities throughout the region. These centres provide protected housing, jobs in sheltered workshops and generally create opportunities for adults with learning disabilities to live more independently and with dignity. The project\u2019s mission is to donate every Euro raised and we can\u2019t think of a nicer way to spend money and time than with a paint brush and a big pile of bricks.", " Choice by Suzanne Woods Fisher was published by Baker in February 2010 and is our 18898th best seller. The ISBN for The Choice is 9780800733858.\nI happen to love the film Witnesswith Harrison Ford which is about an \u2018English\u2019 man living in an Amish community \u2013 and this book is written on a similar theme, but without the grisly murder. It is essentially a love story with sad bits and surprises, and I liked the characters involved and the story moved along at a good pace. It appealed to me because it had several sub-plots interweaving through the main story of how a young Amish girl copes with the death of her father and enters a marriage that was not what she had expected. There are \u2018English\u2019 characters who help the story along by showing the conflict between community living and a materialistic life-style; and also we see the theme of how the Amish can live for their community alone without fully understanding the Christian Faith that underpins it, as several of the young people struggle to determine whether they will stay with the Amish or leave the stable family life that they have had, to experience life with the English.\nThe simplicity of the Amish life is described well and the rhythm of life throughout each year is very evident in the farming community \u2013 the author manages to make it a very appealing lifestyle. I read the book in two sittings \u2013 I enjoyed the twists and turns and was satisfied with the ending, which although I am a hopeless romantic, wasn\u2019t over mushy and left enough loose ends to leave you thinking - \u2018I wonder what happens afterwards...\u201d", "Editing Mythix Fairy:MFHeadingh.png|thumb|250px]]'''Mythix Fairy''' is a doll collection produced by Witty Toys featuring [[Bloom]], [[Stella]], [[Flora]], [[Aisha]], [[Tecna]] and [[Musa]] in their [[Mythix]] form. ==Description== {{Quote|6 Winx Mythix to collect, their wings move for real!

Normally as I get to the station at 8.10 it\u2019s the rosy pink or orange sky that is breathtaking as the sun slowly rises and peeks over the horizon. On Monday as I got to the station 35 minutes later, the sun was fully in the sky and the reflections on the water were remarkable. Then I realised that I still had 30 minutes to wait for a train. It was at this point I did seriously consider going back home to grab my SLR camera, but in the end I just used the camera on my phone (which is thankfully, pretty good quality).

They don\u2019t happen unless all people involved in the local community, from the landowners, to the county, to the state, to the agencies, come together, work together, and collaborate. And one case on a wind project in Wyoming, we encountered a little bit of a different stakeholder in that we had to work with the local Indian group. In which case, we were up on a mountaintop, and they found some wheels, some Indian artifacts on this mountain, and it was determined that the Indians should be able to conduct their vision quests up in the middle of this wind project. So, in order for the wind project to be successfully developed, there had to be a co-operative agreement entered into with these tribal groups so that at certain periods of time, they would be able to access the property. There was one access point, and the interesting thing was that the landowners in the project had to agree to enter into these easement agreements with these tribal councils in order to provide for this access. So, we were the key negotiator and liaison between the landowners and the Indian tribes, to be able to reach a successful resolution on that agreement so that they would be able to access the property without it interfering with the agriculture use in the grazing and the other uses of the property, in order for the project to be developed and financed.", "A working heating and AC system is key to keeping a comfortable environment in your home, no matter the time of year.

In the 5th grade, I chose the trombone, and played in band all the way through Jr. High and High School. I attended the University of Kansas on trombone scholarship, and while there I played and sang in a variety of musical ensembles, including the symphonic band, jazz band, marching band, basketball band, trombone choir, gospel choir, and the jazz singers. I also was a karaoke DJ. I received my degree in Music Composition, and then moved to San Diego. I was the lead singer and trombonist for several years in a rock band that played at various venues in the San Diego area, and recorded a CD with the group. I also played trombone in a jazz funk band. I\u2019ve been singing for about 17 years in an a cappella group called Singchronicity, and we sing at various events around San Diego County.\nI am married to a wonderful man named Marni, and we have a daughter named Aria who is 17, and my son Noah is 15 and both attend San Marcos High School.

On our way to our new home, we passed a Hardee\u2019s restaurant. I asked my dad why that place called Hardee\u2019s had the Carl\u2019s Jr. logo on it. He told me that Hardee\u2019s is the southern version of Carl\u2019s Jr. My first thought was these southerners were going to be weirder than I thought. But things kept changing as I lived here longer. Nobody had really ever heard of Red Robin, a popular restaurant in Colorado; there were no stucco homes, only brick; it was even rare to find sidewalks; and it was always really hot. Whenever I met someone new at my first school in Alabama, they always asked me \u201care you an Auburn or Alabama fan?\u201d and based their opinions of me solely on the answer I gave. However, I quickly learned the city was not filled with rednecks or trucks. And not everyone listened to country music. I\u2019m still learning things about Alabama. As I meet more and more people, I realize that some of them were born in Alabama, live in Alabama, and plan on dying in Alabama. Most of the time it\u2019s because people are afraid of change.

Warboys eased to a 3-0 success against Oakham United Reserves in a final played at the Branch Bros Stadium in Peterborough. Its been a brilliant season and it was great to end it with a trophy, said player-boss Whitfield. Weve got a group of players who are willing to work hard and also capable of playing good football. It was a perfect performance in the final in many ways. We didnt give Oakham the opportunity to get into the game. To win promotion and lift a cup only a few days apart is rare, but certainly a great feeling. Myself and Martin (assistant, Lloyd) are proud of everything the boys have achieved and were already looking forward to next season. Were also thankful to the people who work hard behind the scenes, our sponsors and supporters. Warboys took command of the Shield showpiece with two early goals. Leading scorer Michael Cafferkeys ninth minute opener quickly being followed by Carl Taylors header. The match was then delayed when Warboys defender Matt Duncan was briefly knocked out in a collision with his own goalkeeper, Liam Gaynor. A paramedic was called to treat Duncan, who was then taken to hospital by ambulance, but later allowed home. Cafferkey slotted into defence in his absence and helped Warboys keep a clean sheet.

The most common problem that's _not_ fixable without a 'spares unit' is a breakdown of the horizontal output transformer (line output transformer over here :-)). This often does result in a continuous crackling (small sparks from the EHT supply to chassis, etc). It'll result in a totally dark screen, it may also remove the heater supply. But it could be a lot of other things. Many faults result in a totally dark screen. 'Crackling noises' may come from ther sections of the monitor nosies are remarkable hard to describe. What I would do is pull the case and check the CRT electrode voltages (watch out for the focus pin which may have around 5kV on it!). Check the EHT at the anode connector if you have a suitable meter (expect around 25kV here on a colour CRT). And work back from there. -tony", "Gold and Green jackpot spill Automatenspiele Gratis Download Spielen Ohne Anmeldung Real Online Slot Machine Lancelot gratis pa nett advokathjelp Casino.

While I listen to the divine remixes of, soon to be legendary, Cyril Hahn. I look back on my week. Though I am thrilled to have survived yet another stressful week as a fashion student and blogger, my biggest obstacle this week came from my good old Frenemy that most people know as \u2018winter weather\u2019. Thanks to the giant curveball the weather threw at me I had to fiend myself a new winter coat that would keep me nice and warm this winter asap. I did recently stumbled upon this biker model type jacket lined with wool I am wearing in this outfit. I had high hopes for this jacket and wanted to add it to my wardrobe as my 2012/13 winter jacket. But sadly enough, next to the massive look it gives me when I completely close the jacket, it\u2019s not warm enough! The wool like lining isn\u2019t as thick as I thought to be. It promises to be a very cold winter here in Holland and sadly enough I am afraid the jacket can\u2019t handle the freeze. So my search for a new jacket continues.

There was no mystery; only history. Cheney was Bush's self appointed enforcer; Wolfowitz the ideologue, Rumsfeld the muscle. Condoleeza Rice's ties to Rumsfeld have been well documented, she is a part of inner circle. The odd man out, the one who was not a neocon was Powell and he has been marginalized. The foreign agenda is clear; less clear has been the attendant economic policy aimed at bankrupting government spending and juicing up the budget deficit in the hope (what other aim could there have been?) of rolling back the welfare state. Paul Krugman of the Times, and many others have explained this. Watch out for the long term unraveling on that front. Seymour Hersh's articles in the New Yorker have documented the obstinate insularity and resolve of the neo cons in the face of critics and obvious failure in Iraq. This was the quiet \"neocon revolution\"--and the great majority of people (indeed, in a sense not even Bush himself) had any idea it was happening. But happen it did.

Since the magnetic field can provide an alternative driving force to help the condensed liquid traveling to the evaporating side of heat pipe, we can take advantage of this to enhance the performance of heat pipe. In order to enhance the performance of our next generation magnetic ferro-fluid heat pipe and further investigate the fluid motion in micro channels, experiments of a magnetic drop through a narrow passage are carried under various control parameters. The magnetic ferro-fluids we used are commercial light mineral oil-based ferro-fluids (EMG905) produced by Ferrotec Corp. The experiments have shown the process of a ferro-fluid drop passing through narrow passages with different sizes (diameters =0.3mm, 0.5 mm and 0.8mm) under various applied magnetic field strengths. The common characteristics are recorded in details, such as drop deformation, necking down, pinch-off, separation, and the formation of a satellite drop. Although the capillary driving force drops as the size of micro-channel increases, it is easier and faster for magnetic fluid to pass through larger size of micro-channel. Therefore, an optimized size or maybe several mixed-size micro-channels of magnetic heat pipe should be adopted for better performance. In addition, initial location of the magnetic field source (a coil of electromagnet) is also an important factor to be considered when a magnetic microchannel heat pipe is designed. Last but not least, applying magnetic field to enhance the performance of heat pipe is now possible and practical. The magnetic flow motion is interesting and should be further studied with various thermal conditions. More theoretical analysis and simulations of the new idea is currently under development and some preliminary results with experimental data will be presented in this conference paper.", "The most popularly known imaging parameter to measure the amount of light coming through the lens is an F-Stop, referring to the aperture of the lens. However, not many people know what a T-Stop (the light transmittance rate) means and how that is significant in comparison to the F-Stop. We have found this short and simple video by Channel 8 explaining the difference between F-Stop and T-Stop, and why that matters.\nThe video begins with a quick summary of the definition for aperture, which refers to the ratio of the opening size of a lens to the focal length. Aperture value is represented in F-numbers, with larger F-numbers having narrower aperture openings. For example, an f8 aperture is narrower than an f2 aperture, hence f8 lets in less amount of light than f2. While the aperture directly tells us the amount of light that comes into the lens, it does not accurately represent the amount of light that will be effectively transmitted to the image sensor. Due to light passing through many elements of glass, reflection, and the refraction happening inside the lens body, there will be a small amount of light loss. Therefore, transmittance rate, measured in T-stops, is a more representative method to let us know the exact amount of light hitting the image sensor in the end.\nDifferent lenses, though having the same focal length and aperture value, may have varying transmittance rates. Most available lenses do not show the actual T-Stop values, except for high grade cinema lenses. If absolute technical accuracy is important, knowing the equivalent T-Stop number will make a difference, instead of just looking at the general aperture of the lens.", "Mail purchase is the purchasing of goods or service simply by mail buy delivery.

The pattern I chose has a pieced block in the center and sort of an Irish chain running off of it. The pattern shows the quilt made up in white, pink & black.

I hooked one of them to the mic input on my ubuntu server. I wrote a script that uses rec from sox with a silence filter. It works perfect for that one line. Problem I'm having is I cant figure out how to record from my second tap. In alsamixer I can only set one recording device even after I installed a second sound card. I was originally trying all this with pulseaudio, but was unable to get any of it to work until I removed pulseaudio. Only way I can think to get this to work is to plug both of the taps into linein and have each of them record on one of the stereo channels, but this is not preferable. I would like to be able to record each phone call on either line into its own separate file even if both lines are in use at the same time.

As windows age they can become loose in the window frame. Windows that are loose in their frames allow drafts to come in from the outside and heating or cooling energy from your home to escape. Though window replacements initially cost money the newer replacements will eventually help to save you money on your heating and cooling bills. The money that is wasted when the heating escapes from your old windows can be saved if your windows are replaced with newer windows that fit correctly in the window frame. Although it can be done replacing windows is not a generally recommended do it yourself project. It is a better idea to hire someone with experience to fit and install your new windows to ensure proper installation. There are many window replacement contractors in Sonoma County that can help you to pick out the correct windows for your home. Window replacement companies in Sonoma County can also come to your home to take out the old windows and install the new ones so there is very little work involved on your part. Sonoma County window replacement contractors have crews of employees that have extensive experience in installing windows.

Now it is a oases of peace and quietness, just out of the old city of Vientiane. And surrounded by a beautiful garden with old trees. The only thing that you could be missing is a swimming pool. We had a Suite room on the ground floor behind the main building. As it is a old house with extensions actually all rooms are a bit different. And the all breath the old atmosphere that must have been in Vientiane 100 years ago but now with the comforts of today. Like TV, Airco and mini-bar. Our room was comfortable, although the bathroom is a bit small. Buffet breakfast is good, actually for me very good. But it has a bit limited choice, so it was a disappointment for my wife. Staff is friendly and service minded. The hotel has bicycles to explorer the old city of Vientiane.\nThe restaurant of the hotel called Na Dao is a very good French kitchen that serves lunch & dinner. All together we loved this hotel. Highly recommended! I did now stay a few times in this hotel and although I still think it is very nice hotel I also think that there are many things that could be improved (in compare to the price of the rooms). I am thinking here about quality and cleanliness of the rooms and breakfast service.

(See yorkcounts.org) After 2\u00bd years of study involving 25 \u2013 30 community volunteers, including the school superintendents from the City of York and the four first-ring suburbs, the organizing committee presented the charter application to three York County school districts on November 13, 2009: The School District of the City of York, the York Suburban School District and The Central York School District. By the end of February of 2010, each of these three districts had approved the charter application, two of them unanimously. York Academy is unique in two primary ways: (1) the school is the only three-district charter school in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and (2) the school is the only charter school in the Commonwealth which has combined students from school districts with dramatically different racial and socio-economic education opportunity that could serve to and strong and innovative. The group pursued the International Baccalaureate Programme for its internationally-recognized, unique, transdisciplinary approach to education that creates an academically challenging and personally enriching environment. York Academy is the only three-district, K-12 regional charter school recognized as a fully-accredited International Baccalaureate (IB) Primary Years Programme school and is an authorized IB World School. York Academy opened on August 22, 2011 in the historic, pre-Civil War Smyser-Royer building located at 32 W. North Street in the City of York with students in kindergarten, first, and second grades and will continue to add one grade each year until it reaches full implementation as a K-12 school.", "Persistent rain and pesky Occupy protesters clogging downtown kept a whole lot of trucks off the road today so the options seemed quite few going in to my lunchtime. Luckily I was running late because a (relatively) late tweet from Dorothy Moon had me out the door in a split second. Fourth day out and already running pretty efficiently. Their Facebook page advertises a pretty extensive burger menu so I don't know if it is because they are so new and are just trying to feel things out, or if maybe the rain, and therefore lighter demand, caused a stunted menu but the offerings were pretty simple: $6 for a single, $7 for a double. You could select as many toppings as you wanted for the inclusive price, including bacon, 3 kinds of cheese, an egg, several sauces & condiments, plus a bunch of vegetables.

It is virtually identical to white sugar and is 99% sucrose. Raw sugar does have a few minerals but not enough to give a huge health advantage over white sugar.Another few that may be of interest are:Brown sugar contains 95% sucrose and 5% molasses, which adds a toffee flavour and sogginess but no great nutritional benefits over white sugar.Caster sugar has the same composition as white (granulated) sugar, but the crystals are smaller so it dissolves faster. It\u2019s best for baking, especially light sponges and meringues.Icing sugar is also just white sugar ground to a fine powder so it dissolves quickly and makes smooth icing.Despite their different colours and flavours, the nutritional value of these sugars is very similar. (Sadly,) Sugar is sugar, whether white, brown or raw. One teaspoon of any has around 68 kilojoules (16 calories).Any sugar can be hazardous when consumed in excessive amounts; and though not many, raw sugar does have a few minerals, so I suppose it is technically a better alternative to white sugar.And while you don\u2019t need to avoid or cut out sugar completely, it would be sensible to cut back on foods that are high in sugar AND low in nutritional value.For example: soft drinks, lollies, pastries or sweets.", "thebus36idf\n01-22-2009, 01:03 AM\nI will be the first to admit I was wrong.

It is caused by damage to, or irregularities inside the brain as it develops. This causes problems which disrupt the brain\u2019s ability to regulate movement and maintain posture and balance. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), some of the clinical signs and symptoms of CP include lack of muscle control, abnormal reflex responses, and spastic movements in body and face muscles. Stem cell and platelet-rich plasma injection therapy assists in the recovery process of damaged tissues in the body and are constantly looking into new methods of healing for all ailments.\nThere is no known cure for CP, but stem cell therapy is still in its research stage when it comes to its effectiveness. The Birth Injury Guide reports that the research so far has proven to be successful in reducing brain damage and combating the side effects of CP. The website also states that, \u201cExperts speculate that once the research is out of its clinical trial stages, patients will probably need accompanying forms of therapy as well.\u201d These include physical therapy and physiotherapy, which can help with the success of stem cell therapy.\nAlthough most of the clinical trials for both stem cell and platelet-rich plasma injection therapy are still being conducted, positive results are continually being accomplished for people who are qualified to receive this therapy. It is important to keep in mind that not everybody will respond the therapy the same way. That is why we conduct a complete medical examination prior to beginning therapy, so we can completely understand a patient\u2019s condition and if they are eligible to receive it.", "Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany\nThe continuous trend towards miniaturization of metallic micro parts of high quality at low costs results in the need of appropriate production methods. Mechanical manufacturing processes like forming and blanking meet these demands. One major challenge for the application of them are so called size effects. Especially the downsizing of the required manufacturing tools and adequate positioning causes higher effort with increasing miniaturization. One promising approach for downsizing of tools is the transfer of knowledge from microsystems technology. This study shows the process behavior of etched silicon punches in microblanking operations. For the application as tool material especially the brittle material behavior and sensitivity against tensile stresses have to be considered. These mechanical loads favor wear in form of cracks and breaks at the cutting edge of the punch and decrease tool life. In a special test rig these wear phenomena were observed in microblanking of copper foils. Although high positioning accuracy between tools and workpiece can be assured within this test rig, scatter of tool life is observable. Therefore, a finite element analysis of the tool load in the microblanking process with special respect to tensile stresses was performed. Within the 3D finite element model multidimensional positioning errors like tilting between punch and die were integrated. Their influence on the tool load in form of increasing tensile stresses is evaluated with respect to the type and magnitude of positioning error. Furthermore, the effects of small outbreaks at the cutting edge on the process behavior and tool load.", "WIC includes a able status been to Find repost Song and novel quantities in a affiliated objective request.

Viewing 2 posts - 1 through 2 (of 2 total) Author Posts March 17, 2015 at 7:13 am #36053 SeanParticipant What is the advised or practical limit to the number of valve solinoids that an OS system should activate at the same time? March 17, 2015 at 10:07 pm #36070 RayKeymaster The firmware does not limit the number of parallel stations \u2014 the limit depends on the current rating of your sprinkler transformer. Just to give you an idea: each solenoid, when open, draws about 180 to 250mA of current. So if your sprinkler transformer is 750mA, you can most likely run 4 valves at the same time \u2014 in practice it can be more, because as more valves are open, the total current draw increases, which drives down the output voltage of the transformer (AC transformers are un-regulated), thus the current per station reduces, and consequently more valves can open. I did some tests a while back, with a 750mA transformer I can open 8 valves at the same time. Author Posts Viewing 2 posts - 1 through 2 (of 2 total) You must be logged in to reply to this topic.

Bobbi Rebell reports.\nA healthy outlook for nutrition and weight loss company Herbalife, which has been the subject of a very public feud among activist investors. It says its fourth quarter profits and sales will be above analysts' estimates- and also confirmed its 2014 forecast. Herbalife also boosted its share repurchase program- and said it's going to raise a billion dollars through a convertible note issue. Investors liked that- the news lifting its stock- which is down 18 percent so far in 2014. Wedbush analyst Rommel Dionisio has an outperform and a $90 target on the stock. He told me quote: \"Core fundamental momentum of the business is as strong as ever, having posted yet another upside surprise in the fourth quarter. The fact that they are maintaining guidance for 2014 in the face of adverse currency impacts, given exchange rate fluctuations of the last few weeks is a further indication that the core business is as strong as ever.\" The news- a bit of a setback for activist investor Bill Ackman- he's been betting heavily against the company- and said as recently as last week that he was sticking by his billion dollar short position. But it's a good day for those on the other side- like Carl Icahn and George Soros. Icahn is Herbalife's biggest shareholder with an almost 17 percent stake as of the most recent filings. The big controversy- naysayers say it's a pyramid scheme- focusing more on recruiting sales people than selling to outside customers- a charge the company denies.", "\nAbstract\nIntroduction: Thalassaemia is an inherited blood disorder and is a significant public health alarm in Malaysia with many not knowing they are carriers of this haemoglobin disorders. Materials and methods: This study conducted a one off collection of blood samples from 72 Malays students of International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) in Kuantan. Blood samples were subjected to conventional haemoglobin analyses that include full blood count and picture, HPLC, Haemoglobin electrophoresis and H-inclusion test. All samples were also genotyped for alpha thalassaemia\u20131 of Southeast Asia (a-Thal1SEA). Result: There were 17(23.6%) students who were diagnosed as thalassaemia carriers. Out of this, four (5.5 %) and six (8.3 %) students were presumptive \u03b2-thalassaemia trait and Haemoglobin-E trait as determined by the HPLC assay respectively. Nine (12.5%) students were genotyped a-Thal1SEA among whom two were also \u03b2-thalassaemia carriers. All thalassaemia cases had MCH of < 27pg. Nonetheless, two out of six Haemoglobin-E trait and three out of nine a-Thal1SEA carrier had MCV value of >80fL. Two out of four (50%) presumptive \u03b2 -thalassaemia trait and one out of six (17%) students of presumptive Haemoglobin-E trait had family history of thalassaemia respectively. Conclusion: The high occurrence of the three common types of thalassaemia carrier (\u03b2, Hb-E and a-Thal1SEA thalassaemia) in our small group of subjects could be due to better participation of students who had family history of thalassaemia. The study reaffirmed the importance of molecular study for detection of alpha-thalassaemia and the use of MCH value of <27pg rather than MCV value of < 80fL for prediction of thalassaemia.

The tablet that was just mere months old was discontinued by the popular PC manufacturer, and liquidated to sell at $99 for the 16GB model and $149.99 for the 32GB variant. This move came as a shock because HP hasn't done much with the OS that cost them a cool $1.2 billion to acquire. Now they're cutting their loses all together, estimated at another $1 billion, and stepping away from that market. This means, with WebOS and the TouchPad gone, the only truly relevant OS's are now just Android, iOS, and Windows Phone 7. I don't consider Blackberry as one of the 3 because they are still pushing to get into the touch market, and I honestly do not see them stepping in the ring anytime soon. Microsoft is pushing hard to shove their Windows Phone 7 OS down our throats, and with all the patent lawsuits going back and forth, they are sort of winning. Apple is also taking the battle into the court rooms and making sure Samsung will not be available for us to purchase when it comes time for Christmas --or black Friday for that matter. This elephant in the room has to be posted, so please share your thoughts about this news below. Did you get a chance to buy the tablet?

That means the Orioles might not end up accomplishing much more at the Winter Meetings than making a selection in the Rule 5 Draft. \u201cKeep in mind who the Orioles are,\u201d says Duquette. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an established pitching staff. We\u2019ve got a strong everyday lineup. We\u2019ve got to fill a few holes. We\u2019re going to look at some options in the major league free-agent market and sign a couple players.\u201d The Orioles have received plenty of trade interest in starter Wei-Yin Chen, Encina writes. Here are more notes on the Orioles.\n- Agent Scott Boras expresses optimism that the Orioles can work out ways to keep Chris Davis and Matt Wieters, Encina reports. Both players are eligible for free agency after the season. \u201cI do think there\u2019s a chance with all players,\u201d Boras says. \u201cDan and I talk a great deal and, obviously, we have to do our arbitration for annual contracts here soon. I think both players enjoy playing in Baltimore.\u201d Boras says he and Duquette have not talked about a potential extension for Chen.\n- The Orioles discussed a trade with the Phillies for lefty reliever Antonio Bastardo before Philadelphia shipped Bastardo to the Pirates, Roch Kubatko of MASNsports.com tweets. (That\u2019s not the unconsummated pitching trade that Duquette alluded to, Kubatko clarifies in a reply.) Even with the departure of Andrew Miller, the Orioles already have several good lefties in Zach Britton, T.J.

He homesteaded near Sintaluta, where he worked as a schoolteacher and served in the Yorkton Company during the 1885 North-West Resistance. In 1886 he married Mary Stephens, and they worked together building their farm and raising a family of five. Partridge, a widely read man, began to engage in an analysis of the difficulties western farmers were facing as a result of tariff-related high costs and low prices due to the actions of the private grain trade. In 1901, Partridge and other disgruntled farmers organized the Territorial Grain Growers Association. He soon concluded that the problem was the class nature of capitalism, and that more radical action was therefore needed. He helped organize the Grain Growers\u2019 Grain Company and edited the farmers\u2019 news journal, the Grain Growers\u2019 Guide. He campaigned for public ownership of the elevator system, and the \u201cPartridge Plan\u201d resulted in government support for a co-operative elevator company.\nIn 1910 Partridge joined the \u201cSiege of Ottawa\u201d despite having lost a leg in an accident in 1908. Then great personal tragedy struck Partridge and his wife: in 1914 a daughter drowned, and their two sons were killed in World War I service. Nevertheless Partridge would not rest: he joined the Progressive Party, and helped organize the Farmer\u2019s Union and the Saskatchewan Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited\u2014later to become the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. During the 1920s Partridge laid out his vision of a better world in his book, War on Poverty, whose message reflects the remarkable resilience of the human spirit. However, Partridge was not able to recover from one final loss: his wife\u2019s death. He left Saskatchewan, and ended his own life in Victoria in 1931.\nMurray Knuttila", "A winged figure, Lady Melancholy sits slumped surrounded by symbolic objects. In Medieval and Renaissance medicine, melancholy was a humour caused by an excess of black bile and her posture suggests the contemplative attitude and the mental anguish produced in people who suffer with this temperament. Artists, philosophers, theologians and craftsmen were thought to particularly susceptible to melancholy and were often said to have a Saturnine nature, that is to be under the influence of the planet Saturn. Further allusions to Saturn can be found in the purse and keys which are traditional attributes of the patron god of melancholy.\nDirectly above Melancholy\u2019s head is an hourglass showing the passing of time, and a magic square that adds up to 34 every which way. Additional references to alchemy can be found in the darkened countenance of the brooding figure, the so-called facies nigra, pointing to the adept that the first stage of the Great Work is nigredo (blackness), the putrefaction necessary for all creation. The geometric tools are symbols of various other stages of the magistery, leading up to the six-sided prism (imprinted with a faint human skull) which represents Prime Matter and the seven steps of the ladder, each rung a phrase in the Magnum Opus. The blazing comet in the sky and the rainbow heralds its final completion.\nContrary to the contemporary belief that melancholy has to be banished at all costs, either by chemical means or positive thinking, the Renaissance view of melancholy was that it was the necessary, preliminary stage of all creativity. Without the putrefaction of melancholy you cannot take the first step on the journey that will led to a transformation of matter and, more importantly, the self. Only art can produce this metamorphosis.", "We can't all be world-class dancers; but we can sure as heck feel like one!

In August, he provided significant edits to the 10K because he felt the draft contained misrepresentations regarding the company\u2019s financial position as well as the status of the firm\u2019s technological developments. Ultimately, his changes were not accepted. He asked to have his name removed from the final document because he felt that there were still misrepresentations. Within a week, he was informed that all of his duties were being reassigned. His phone calls to his boss were refused. By September, his paychecks came late, and by October not at all. After he missed his October 1 and 15 paychecks, he sent a \u201cresignation\u201d email on October 17 claiming constructive discharge, which the company denied.

The OSHA investigator found cause, and the employer requested a hearing. The administrative law judge found that the employer violated the whistleblower provision of the SOX and awarded damages of $1.2 million and attorney\u2019s fees.

While living in London he fell in love with 16-year-old Harriet Westbrook, whom he married in 1811. He visited Ireland and Wales, writing pamphlets defending vegetarianism and political freedom, and in 1813 published privately Queen Mab, a poem with political freedom as its theme. Meanwhile he had become estranged from his wife and in 1814 left England with the English writer Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, whom he married after Harriet drowned herself in 1816 (see Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley). Alastor, written in 1815, was followed by the epic The Revolt of Islam. By 1818 Shelley was living in Italy where he produced The Cenci; the satire on English poet William Wordsworth, Peter Bell the Third (1819); and Prometheus Unbound. Other works of the period are Ode to the West Wind (1819); The Cloud and The Skylark (both 1820); The Sensitive Plant and The Witch of Atlas; Epipsychidion and, on the death of the English poet John Keats, Adonais (1821); the lyric drama Hellas (1822); and the prose Defence of Poetry (1821).

His previous work has been in television including 2008\u2019s award winning Margaret Thatcher: The Long Walk to Finchley.\nSeventeen-year-old Emelia Conan Doyle gets a job as a cleaner at the Cliff House Hotel. The hotel is home to a author who has suffered writers block for twenty years and his dysfunctional family which includes young Posy, teenager Beth (Felicity Jones) and the long suffering and brittle Joa (Julia Ormond) wife and mother, ex-actress and now head cook and bottle washer at the hotel, to this ensemble our newly employed cleaning lady injects a renewed enthusiasm for life. The writer Jonathan (The Lives of Others (2006) Sebastian Koch) falls for Emelia while dispensing creative writing lessons in his private study. Beth strikes up a close friendship with Emelia persuading her to accompany her to Oxford University where Beth is to take part in the entrance interviews. While there and under the tutorage of Emelia, the naive Oxford hopeful learns that there is more to life than studying!\nReading some of the reviews you get the impression that the British critics were not convinced by film but I must differ. Although the narrative was a little lightweight I found it to be a very pleasurable and amusing 90 minutes greatly helped by the pitch perfect performance from Jessica Brown Finlay as the charismatic Emelia. I agree that the plot\u2019s important, but even with the best-written screenplays the cinemagoer is not always as entertained?", " Very simple, chords used: D (once) and E, F, G.

In between producing, making his own music, and filling creative roles for every brand from G-Star to Adidas, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and Apple, the musician turned designer has also found the time to collaborate with Chanel\u2014and you're about to see even more of him soon. That's because Pharrell will be starring in the iconic brand's next campaign behind their Gabrielle bag, which first appeared in Chanel's [spring 2017 show](), *WWD* [reports]().\\n\\nThe move is an exciting one, but not entirely unexpected for Pharrell Williams. Aside from the ongoing blurring of gender binaries in fashion\u2014with fellow artists like Jaden Smith modeling for Louis Vuitton's womenswear\u2014Pharrell has a longstanding relationship with label head Karl Lagerfeld. He made his runway debut at Chanel's recent [Metiers d'Arts show](), after starring in a [short film for Chanel]() back in 2014. Pharrell and Karl Lagerfeld have also worked together over the years on custom pieces for the artist like the Chanel rosaries he's often seen wearing. Plus, Pharrell has plenty of experience with handbags when it comes to designing them. That same year he collaborated with Moynat on an eccentric collection of train-themed purses. \\n\\nFor the Gabrielle campaign, Pharrell will be joined by some familiar faces. He'll be reunited with Cara Delevingne, and Chanel muses Kristen Stewart and Caroline de Maigret will also appear in the campaign. We'll have to wait until April 3 to see the first look at the campaign, but, for now, you can revisit the time Pharrell and Cara danced and sang together in the name of fashion for Chanel. \\n\\n[#video:](690x400)||||||", "Visual QuickStart Guide: XML, Second Edition Goldberg, K.H. 2009 Berkeley, Ca Peachpit Press XML All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies Wagner, R. & Mansfield, R. 2002 Hoboken, NJ Wiley Publishing Visual QuickStart Guide: JavaScript & Ajax, Seventh Edition Negrino,T. & Smith, D. 2009 Berkeley, Ca Peachpit Press w3schools At w3schools.com you will learn how to make a website.

The latest release from the album, \u2018Atari\u2019, offers a departure from melancholy, while still holding on to those nostalgic vibes that permeate the EP as a whole.The light and airy love song comes as an ode to the 16-bit video gaming of the eighties and early nineties. The video for \u2018Atari\u2019 ironically compiles Oriental tropes with elements of old Nintendo and Atarti gaming to create a new narrative. It is the follow-up-video to \u2018Film Faransi\u2019 by director Hala Alsalman starring Iraqi actress Zahraa Gandour from October and \u2018Ana Mashi\u2019 shot by Berlin based Artist Dana Engfer released in May, 2020 - and the three have ultimately been compiled in an audiovisual trilogy. What ties the three of them? They all address questions of longing and belonging in a period of time where the idea of distance manifests itself into new shapes and forms. As a duo who has always been constrained by geographic limitation - Ibi working from New York and Hanno from Berlin - the idea of distance is a vital aspect of their work, exacerbated by the widespread lockdowns brought on by the pandemic. Check out the whole EP below.", "Saying 'Thank You.'\nI still have about 10 days in Japan for this summer but that is time needed for administrative responsibilities and other chores. I will spend today cleaning my gear and packing it for travel across Japan and then across the Pacific Ocean. I will also visit the various senchoo and Kenkyukai and Kyoukai leaders to express my gratitude for their support and consideration of me while I stayed on Mikura this summer. 'Osewani narimasu' means 'thank you for taking good care of me'. I also will distribute a 3 page summary of my research efforts and other details. This will be posted later this weekend or early next week as a field report update for all of you. On Miyake, I will do the same, visiting senchoo and the gyokou (the Fishermen's cooperative) to say thanks. I will also give a presentation at the Nature Center. Following my stay on Miyake I leave for Tokyo to visit and thank my funding agency and then finally to my host University and the professors there. I will again give a presentation and share my preliminary findings with colleagues. I'll post updates about some of these visits so you can follow along. it is all part of the field work process, even though it is not exactly data collection. Cheers Kathleen P.S.

It\u2019s yet another terrific and terrifically dark year-ender, and once again shows off Field\u2019s skill with actors and pitch-perfect feel for handling tricky literary adaptations. Not to cause rancor in the Winslet-Mendes household, but this vision of the suburbs feels much more three-dimensional that the enervated setting of \u201cAmerican Beauty.\u201d\nThe ironic use of a mock-clinical unseen narrator (Will Lyman, so memorable from PBS\u2019 \u201cFrontline\u201d) reminded me of the similar coolly omniscient narration in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cBarry Lyndon,\u201d another tale of bad behavior among the overprivileged. Or at least it did after I noticed that \u201cLittle Children\u201d was co-produced by Leon Vitali, who as a young actor played lily-livered Lord Bullingdon in \u201cBarry Lyndon.\u201d After curtailing his onscreen career, Vitali served as Kubrick\u2019s assistant on the director\u2019s last three films, ending with \u201dEyes Wide Shut\u201d \u2014 in which Field plays the piano player who provides his old friend (Tom Cruise) with the location of a high-end orgy. Ta-daa! (I can get from Field to Kevin Bacon, however, in just one move: They were both in the 1991 coming-of-age ensemble piece \u201cQueens Logic.)\nKubrick\u2019s influence seems to be all over the place this season (\u201cThe Fountain\u201d and \u201cChildren of Men\u201d are the work of directors and technicians who have mainlined \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d and \u201cFull Metal Jacket,\u201d respectively), but \u201cLittle Children\u201d puts a spin on the master\u2019s style: It has more pity for its characters than Kubrick showed in his own suburban investigation, \u201cLolita.\u201d By the end, everyone has been bloodied (literally or otherwise) and bowed, but at least they\u2019re alive.", "tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-788645746622659643.post7804656079347351749..comments2022-08-26T20:42:24.003-04:00Comments on Fringe Television - Fan Site for the FOX TV Series Fringe: CompleteThePattern.com Phase 2Fringe so much, but I can't open the screensav...thanks so much, but I can't open the screensaver zip... any help?Unknown from Brazil :)Tanks from Brazil :)Lucas Gelati found it helpful.

The attraction is not surprising, since leaves offer a wonderful sensory experience, boasting colours, textures and sounds that can help promote many aspects of development. Playing with leaves is thought to stimulate the \u2018tactile system\u2019 of the body that is required for children to interpret touch. By picking up, piling, throwing and kicking the leaves, children are exposed to a variety of sensory stimulants which help encourage openness to trying new things, as well as increasing cognitive capacity. There\u2019s also physical, creative and emotional benefits, not to mention links to immunological development. After all, the \u2018hygiene hypothesis\u2019 theorises that not exposing children to dirt at an early age may be to the detriment of their immune systems.

We chatted and as I was buying from him a soldier walked up and grabbed a key out of the young man's pocket. It was a huge, iron key, clearly to a very old building. It was the type of key that is iconic in Palestine, often used as a symbol of 1948 refugees who carefully locked their doors as they ran away from their villages, expecting to return soon. The soldier grabbed the key and laughed. He held it up for his colleague to see. Their looks said, how old! See, the Arabs are so backward. The young man just laughed. He deals with these soldiers, stationed ten feet from his shop, every day. I did the only thing that I could do - spend money, chat, smile.

Surprisingly, given her background, she did not start playing the guitar until she was in her late teens but took to the instrument naturally. Despite throwing herself wholeheartedly into music, the highly photogenic Lambert initially enjoyed more success as a part-time actress, landing a small role in the 2001 movie Slap Her Shes French. During the same period, and yet to finish high school, she formed her own Texas Pride Band and launched herself on the local bar band circuit as a professional artist. Her parents helped finance the pressing of a CD to showcase their daughters songs, leading to some local chart success with the tracks Texas Pride and Somebody Else.\nLamberts music career was really kick-started in 2003 when she won through to the final of the nationally syndicated Nashville Star television show, eventually finishing third behind Buddy Jewell and John Arthur Martinez. The reward for her success was the signing of a major label recording contract with Sony Music. Having battled her way up through the Texas honky-tonk circuit Lambert was not about to surrender her fiercely independent stance, and was given free rein to work on her debut album, writing or co-writing the majority of Kerosene. The album rewarded her record companys faith by rocketing to the top of the US country charts in April 2005, a remarkable achievement for a new artist. The follow-up Crazy Ex-Girlfriend repeated the feat in summer 2007. The album was another excellent collection from a genuine new talent, mixing original material with well-chosen covers of songs by Gillian Welch, Carlene Carter and Patty Griffin.\nSource: The Encyclopedia of Popular Music by Colin Larkin.

I'm not planning on leaving windows, but I've just always wanted a mac also. I don't want to spend more than around 300 dollars, and I've come to some conclusions of what I can get in that price range. 1. Emac - I've found a good local deal on this actually, here's the link : It seems to come with a lot of software, and 1.25 doesn't see too slow for what I will be doing (Internet, word, email, etc.) I have my pc for all the more intense stuff. 2. Ibook G4 - I've seen these around the same price as the emac, but they all seem to be slower, most likely due to being a laptop. 3. Powermac G4 - There's a bunch of these on ebay and locally, and for pretty cheap too. Should i try to get a dual processor one? Quicksilver, Digital Audio, etc.? I was thinking the emac might be a little big, the ibook a little slow, but the powermac might be just right. I can use my existing monitor, keyboard, etc, and it should be decently fast if I get a dual processor one. I also want to find one that comes with a bunch of software, most importantly iWork or MS Office. So, what would you recommend? Again, I'll only be using it for basic things, and maybe for messing around since it will be my first, cheap mac. -Minicoop503", "Calendar Event Submission Marketing & Communication office Use this form to submit an event for the SMU Online Calendar.

Last year small-scale mining in the area was banned due to safety reasons. The mines bureau said the ground had softened due to liquid waste from mining activities.

We most often see it (1) in elderly folks who bump into someone in a parking lot or street (and mostly really don't notice) and (2) drivers who are afraid of getting charged with a DUI. Some older ordinances and statutes seem to imply that a driver has 24 hours to report any accident. However, that 24-hour notice provision really only applies when the driver cannot locate or immediately contact a police officer. That language has been in the law for many years - long before the wide use of cellphones. With the prevalence of cell phones, however, those provisions are mostly meaningless. Further,many cities are updating their municipal codes to address this old loophole. Leaving the scene of an accident - even a non-serious accident- can have severe consequences. A person convicted of this offense gets 6 points on their driver's license and can go to jail for up to 6 months (same as a DUI), and some judges fairly speculate that the driver fled from the scene because the driver was drunk - and they will gladly put that driver in jail. If you are not drunk or impaired, NEVER leave the scene of an accident. If you believe you are impaired, its best you consult with a lawyer before calling the police. Although the lawyer cannot suggest to you that you leave the scene, that lawyer can give you some good advice on how to handle yourself when the police arrive.", "A friend sent this video my way earlier this week.

While the second volume appeared a year after the premier, pace slowed in the next seven volumes, and seemed all but exhausted by number 9, published sixteen years after its predecessor. The latest volume paused for eight more years. Granted, Dr. Krippner is now 88 years old, but still diligent and adventurous. So are his fellow editors and contributors, although sadly two of them (Professor William Roll, 1926-2012, and Professor Michael Persinger, 1945-2018) are dead and incommunicado. The most startling recurrent theme in this tenth volume is how much hard and conscientious empirical work in a number of varieties of psi leads to the conclusion that many psychic phenomena just are not as substantial as researchers have claimed for more than a century.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.", "There are many hobbies or activities I like to do in my free time. One of the top activities I like to do is to go protest and join the demonstration. As a child growing up in Bangkok, my house was located in the area of many important government offices. Walking to school, I would see the protest demonstration and around my house. Sometime, on the way, I stop and listen to what they\u2019re saying. Later, I started to join different demonstration from time to time. Sometime, I went join the protest to listen to what they\u2019re talking about. Many times, I went to join the demonstration because they gave out free foods, t-shirt, flags, signs, etc. Also, being at the demonstration gives me the advantage to see the bigger picture. Being at the riot sites myself makes me learn that many news report show the viewer only one side of the story. I also go to take pictures and act like a new reporter. When I heard that things got out of control and the protester start to riot I would grab the camera and go take pictures. Many times, I send the photos and video clips I took to the T.V. station. Many weekends, I would go to protest with churches at the abortion clinic or some time join marches. Then before I know it I start to enjoy going to see the demonstration. Then I start to go join the protests, marches, union strikes, and demonstrations every week. Now, every time I have the chance to go to demonstrates I would go. I now realize that I spend a great portion of my time listening to people opinion and speak out my opinion and I enjoyed doing this.", "At Mon, 04 Feb 2008 15:31:10 +0100, CAG wrote: > > hi, > > Takashi Iwai schrieb: > > At Thu, 31 Jan 2008 23:51:19 +0100, > > Computer AG im FSK wrote: > >> Hi, > >> > >> ? > > > > No, it's the right place to apply. > > > > So far, I have no further idea what could be wrong.

Takashi", "I was reading something today that really made me think about how we talk to others. In Matthew 17:24-27, Peter asks Jesus about paying taxes. Jesus first makes a comparison between earthly kingdoms and heavenly kingdoms. Jesus tells Peter where he can find money for the tax. But first, and this is what I thought was particularly relevant, Jesus says \u201cBut so that we may not cause offense\u2026\u201d Another version says, \u201cnot to offend.\u201d In other places, Jesus emphasized treating others gently (Matthew 11:28-30 and 12:20). What\u2019s interesting is that Jesus did not treat everyone gently. In Matthew 12, he had strong words for the religious leaders. He drove merchants and money changers out of the temple with a whip! Why were those circumstances different? Why was it ok to offend in some situations but not in others?\nI think there is at least one difference between the times where Jesus is confrontational and the times when he does not want to offend that is relevant for us. When it comes to sharing God\u2019s kingdom, Jesus is bold and unapologetic. When it comes to talking to people in day-to-day interactions, especially if those people are not in powerful positions, he is gentle and careful to not offend.\nIn terms of relating to us and to our workplaces, when you are telling people about your faith, you should be bold and unapologetic. When you are confronting something that is wrong (such as unethical business practices), you should be courageous and true. When it comes to other interactions, you should be gentle and look to not offend.", "Copyright \u00a9 2000-2017 other required buy Licht und Schatten bei der deutschen Arbeiterversicherung: Vortrag auf 94t in kids with other unmanaged recession. residual buy Licht und Schatten bei der deutschen Arbeiterversicherung: Vortrag auf dem XXVI. s in the healthy axis.

The research adopted survey method as a quantitative research and questionnaire was employed to elicit responses from the respondents that were drawn through accidental sampling of 120 respondents. The theory that led support to this study were Cultivation Analysis and Persuasion Theory and Advertising: Strong and Weak Theory etc. According to these theories media is responsible for shaping or cultivating viewers\u2019 perception of social reality. Findings show that majority of the respondent often exposed to one form of advertisement or the other particularly from the television, billboard and online media. They were highly exposed to Coca cola advertisement in the recent time in the media mentioned above. Also, substantial numbers of the respondents (56.4%) were influenced by the Coca Cola advertisements campaigns while the crucial element that enticed respondents to most of the coca cola advert lies in the type of celebrity/model, copy structured and the visual effects. Similarly, drinking of Coca cola by the Novana University students were partially as a result of their exposure to Coca cola drink advert, although, many of the respondents (72%) still prefer Coca Cola to other drinks to a reasonable extent. Findings further reveled that taste and price of Coca Cola drink are the quality that the majority of the respondents like most. it is recommended that advertising should be real and interesting so as to call and retain prospective buyers for the advertised product.\nGET COMPLETE PROJECT MATERIAL", "Tinklzs 658 Posted August 3 4 minutes ago, Avienas said: You had many ways to tackle it on plague star, you could run a tankie buffer like rhino or chroma, go full dakka with titania, before they patched in difficulty and cheese removal: just donut spam with ember fire bast, etc. The reason why Plague star worked because you could just bring whatever for the most part.

Apparently 84 percent of 16-17 year old boys have been \u201caccidentally\u201d exposed to pornography, while 60 percent of girls. Also mentioned in the stats was that 38 percent of 16-17 percent of boys and 2 percent of girls deliberately looked for pornography. I kinda feel that only one group of boys is being honest here, but that aside, I\u2019d like to bring up another point. The government spent just under $126 million on the project, which seems a little bit of an overkill. I haven\u2019t seen the whole report, but I could have told them for free that the vast majority of boys in that age group would have come across porn on the Internet, accidentally or otherwise.

One of the most significant problems being dealt with today in this book has to do with the opponents at Colossae. The city The city proper- The city was situated 100 miles east of Ephesus and was significant for its wool industry. The People- they seem to have been very cosmopolitan where differing cultural and religious elements mixed. The church- The brothers and sisters who are addressed in 1:2 were probably not converted through the ministry of Paul himself. Critical Questions Authorship- There has been a great deal of argument over the authorship in the last 100 years. Almost none before that. These arguments are based on the following considerations: Arguments against Pauline Authorship: Arguments in favor of Pauline Authorship- The most compelling argument is the close connection of the letter with Philemon, a letter that is almost never questioned as being Pauline. Date- This leads us to ask the question of what kind of prison that Paul was in when he wrote the letter. There are three possibilities: Ephesus during the 3 to 3 1/2 years spent there (Acts 19:10, 22; 20:31). c. Fall of A.D. 52 to Summer 55 Caesarea where he spent two years in enforced confinement (Acts 24:23, 27). c. May A.D. 57 to September 59.

Increased PKR activity has been observed under diabetic and cardiovascular disease conditions. Most of the currently available PKR inhibitors are non-specific and have other effects as well. Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine the effect of novel PKR inhibitor indirubin-3-hydrazone (IHZ) in cultured rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes and wistar rats.Materials and methods:PKR expression was determined by Q-PCR, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. The expression of different gene markers for apoptosis was measured by RT-PCR. Apoptosis and oxidative stress were determined by flow cytometry. KEY FINDINGS: High glucose (HG) treated H9C2 cardiomyocytes and high fructose (HF) treated wistar rats developed a significant increase in PKR expression. A significant increase in apoptosis and generation of reactive oxygen species was also observed in HG treated H9C2 cells and HF treated rats. Reduced vacuole formation and prominent nuclei were also observed in high glucose treated cells. Cardiac hypertrophy and increased fibrosis were observed in HF treated rats. All these effects of HG and HF were attenuated by novel PKR inhibitor, indirubin-3-hydrazone.Significance:Our results indicate IHZ as an effective inhibitor of PKR in vitro and in-vivo, thus it may prove very useful in blocking the multiple harmful effects of PKR.", "Professor Henry Higgins would have to change his little ditty for Eliza Doolittle if he was with our Lafayette leopards today at the shore city of Valencia.

While I do not usually dabble in international law, it is interesting to note how black swan doctrines, and actions out of \u201cnecessity\u201d emerges in tehes contexts. Here is the abstract:, which characteristically lacks the effective institutions and comparatively high degree of normative consensus that enable states to regulate necessity, consistent with the rule of law, in national.\nI argue, in part, that the modern plea of necessity should rest on foundations that differ fundamentally from those of the existential conception inherited from the law of nations, which privileged the \u201cvery existence\u201d of the state qua state. Article 25 modifies, but also builds upon, this partly anachronistic pedigree by borrowing concepts from national criminal law. The often incongruous transposition of these concepts obscures what almost invariably proves to be the real question raised by necessity in the law of state responsibility: who \u2013 which state, states, or other international actors \u2013 should bear the loss? A categorical answer would be neither plausible nor desirable. International law should instead contextualize the inquiry and candidly consider the competing policies and values at stake in the diverse scenarios in which necessity has been, or foreseeably might be, pled. The lodestar of this inquiry should no longer be the formerly paramount \u201cnatural\u201d right of states to preserve themselves; it should be a transparent recognition of the difficult tradeoffs required by the \u2013 sometimes mutually exclusive \u2013 global policies, social interests, and human rights recognized by contemporary international law.", "Today\u2019s just a crazy day.

M\u00fcller) (Coelenterata: Trachymedusae) and other planktonic coelenterates in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. Journal of Plankton Research, 3 (4). 633-643. text not available from this repository.\nAbstract/Summary\nThe vertical distribution and seasonal variability in abundance of the hydromedusa Aglantha digitale (O.F. M\u00fcller) and other coelenterates from the north-east Atlantic Ocean are described. The coelenterates were abundant from May to September and reached peak numbers in June, July and September when concentration of 40 individuals m \u22121 were recorded. A. digitale numerically dominated the codenterate population and accounted for over 80% of the dry weight biomass in hauls taken from 1971 to 1974. The data suggests a 2\u00bd month development period for this medusa from egg to mature adult (8 mm) which supports previous published data. During the growth of the medusa there were considerable changes in the ratios of wet to dry weights. At a bell-height of 1 mm the mean dry weight was 22% of mean wet weight and at 8 mm the mean dry weight was 5% of mean wet weight; the percentage decreased further in the largest specimens to 2% at 25 mm. The majority of A. digitale occurred in the upper 100 m but in late July the larger specimens extended their distribution to the limit of sampling (500 m). The two most abundant siphonophores , Dimophyes arctica (Chun) and Nanomia cara A. Agassiz, were found deeper than the main population of A. digitale . It is suggested that coelenterates could be an important source of nitrogen for the development of the late bloom of phytoplankton in the north-east Atlantic Ocean.", "\"We are reiterating or rating on Isis Pharmaceuticals (ISIS) of a Buy and increasing our price target to $20. Corporation (GENZ)) for high cholesterol and ISIS-113715 for diabetes, along with several other proprietary and partnered programs for oncology, inflammatory disease, asthma, and viral infections. Our financial model forecasts profitability in 2010.\nThanks to various collaborations, Isis has put itself in constant position to receive developmental milestone. The company sees no need to re-tap the financial markets in the next five years. In that regard, in five year we see Isis as cash flow positive, so there may never be a need to re-tap the financial market. Isis exited 2007 with $193.7 million in cash and securities. Adding the $150 million from the Genzyme equity investment, the $175 million up-front payment from Genzyme, and the $20 million equity investment form Abbott Labs (ABT) and Isis is sitting on over $500 million in cash.\nWe note this level does not include another potential $20 million from Abbott before July 31, 2008, and potentially another $175 190 million by July 31, 2009. Management expects to exit 2008 with over $450 million still on the books. Couple all that cash with the potential that mipomersen is a blockbuster and several other compounds are moving nicely forward, and Isis looks like the premier small-to-mid cap biotechnology company in our universe. We see Isis as uniquely well-positioned for a very successful future. We are keeping our Buy rating and $20 price target on Isis Pharmaceuticals. We find it comforting that Genzyme recently agreed to acquire 5 million shares of Isis at $30 per share - $10 above our near-term target.\"", "The marriage of Miss Mary Elizabeth Reid, of Philadelphia, PA, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John R.

After the whole project lay dormant for a couple of months, I picked it up again the other day and was most annoyed by how difficult it was to stay on track. During the Protector's Jubilee XP bonanza I outlevelled the zone I was working on at the time, causing all the quests to \"go grey\", which - following the example set by WoW - caused all the exclamation marks above nearby quest givers' heads to disappear, forcing me to repeatedly click on every NPC in the area to see if a new quest had unlocked. I repeatedly ran into dead ends when I lost track of the main chain and suspect that I missed more than one side quest this way.\nI'm glad that SWTOR never had a system like that, even before they had level sync and when low-level quests gave virtually no rewards. Some of us actually care about seeing the whole story, even if we're overlevelled for it! The disappearance of those quest markers is even weirder in Neverwinter, where grey quests actually continue to give pretty decent XP. I suppose there is the potential for confusion if later quests recycle an old area and players could get old lowbie and new high-level quests mixed up, but that could be solved by at least having a \"show grey quests\" on/off toggle like they introduced in WoW later on.", "On Saturday, a talented field contest the $150,000 Palos Verdes Stakes (G2) at Santa Anita Park, including Breeders\u2019 Cup Sprint champion Amazombie who will surely go favored.

Specifically, the company promotes individual songs or playlists of artists on digital platforms such as Spotify, TikTok or Deezer. Always with the goal of increasing their audience and streams and possibly gaining one of the coveted places in the curated playlists of the major streaming providers - the artist brand is always the focus of the services offered. The two entrepreneurs use this offer not least for the artists of their own three labels: Before Eight for EDM & Pop, Hitstube for party hits and Eniverse Records for Goa. In the future, Before Eight will now work together with the independent music publisher Roba Music Publishing, which, among others, exploits artists or works by Madonna, Sean Paul or Justin Timberlake.

An application to alternative treatment strategies for NSTEMI patients.\nKent S., Briggs A., Eckermann S., Berry C.\nOBJECTIVES: The use of value of information methods to inform trial design has been widely advocated but there have been few empirical applications of these methods and there is little evidence they are widely used in decision making. This study considers the usefulness of value of information models in the context of a real clinical decision problem relating to alternative diagnostic strategies for patients with a recent non-ST elevated myocardial infarction. METHODS: A pretrial economic model is constructed to consider the cost-effectiveness of two competing strategies: coronary angiography alone or in conjunction with fractional flow reserve measurement. A closed-form solution to the expected benefits of information is used with optimal sample size estimated for a range of models reflecting increasingly realistic assumptions and alternative decision contexts. RESULTS: Fractional flow reserve measurement is expected to be cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 1,621, however, there is considerable uncertainty in this estimate and consequently a large expected value to reducing this uncertainty via a trial. The recommended sample size is strongly affected by the reality of the assumptions of the expected value of information (EVI) model and the decision context. CONCLUSIONS: Value of information models can provide a simple and flexible approach to clinical trial design and are more consistent with the constraints and objectives of the healthcare system than traditional frequentist approaches. However, the variation in sample size estimates demonstrates that it is essential that appropriate model parameters and decision contexts are used in their application.", "Hey guys. So to continue on from what I started yesterday I thought I would begin a five or six post series of simple how to go from a to z in simple steps and make some money if you are starting out. This is an expansion of sorts on the word cup method I posted on a few days ago. Here I get the calendar out again and I look at the occasions that come up in a year, mothers day, fathers day, Halloween, Christmas (the last two in particular are excellent) but there are a myriad of smaller occasions that cause a surge in traffic so look at them all and don't overlook any of them. The trick obviously is to hone in then on related products. So product research. Could not be easier. I will take the example of Mothers day. I simply went to Amazon and looked at mothers day products, drilled down until I found some higher end gifts - this gave me (a) a set of exact keyword(s) (b) products I could see and compare commissions on for myself on Amazon, Commission Junction, Link share, etc. I use a range of tools in my own business for assessing volume, commercial intent etc but the fact is that I usually start off with the free google keyword tool and that's all you need really to begin with too. I put in the product keyword and exact match and see what I get, I don't need much volume because these are the definition of buyer keywords. Time spent = 20 mins. Tomorrow I will outline what I would do next. Any questions, just let me know.

Before you start learning snowboard tricks, it is a must that you feel completely comfortable on your board. Having all the basics mastered first is a pre-requisite. You need to have your balance established, be able to carve, stay in control, know your surroundings, but most importantly be able to stop when you need to, this will all depend on your learning ability and who you ride with. If you ride with friends who are better than you, it will almost force you to get better sooner just so you can keep up.

SSH was a classic case of that. By the time people realised just how restrictive the 'commercial' (proprietary) version was becoming, nobody could find the final GPL + permissive licences source tarball (v. 1.2.12) any more. It was quietly purged from and other known public locations, and nobody had it in version control repos. One Bj\u00f6rn Gr\u00f6nvall finally showed up with an old 1.2.12 copy that he still had, which he updated to remove the patented algortihms (IDEA and RSA, the latter being re-added later) and re-released the code as 'ossh'. The OpenBSD Foundation, in turn, noticed his work and created their own fork to rewrite all copylefted modules, and that's what we now call OpenSSH. It's now a _bit_ rarer for significant open source codebases' source code to become so scarce that forking in reaction to the developers going proprietary is impossible.

This grape is traditionally found in Bordeaux, blended with the dominant Sauvignon Blanc, but Australia has established Semillon as an interesting standalone varietal wine that is bright and ageable. (This tasting brought me back to one of the first huge wine tastings I attended in New York City, back when I first started learning about wine and tasting en masse. At that Australian wine tasting I perfected the art of spitting in public, tasting over 60 wines, including a lot of Semillon.)\nWith producers like Tyrrell\u2019s, Thomas Wines and Audrey Wilkinson, we sampled Semillon from 2015, 2009, 2005 and some older. The 2015\u2019s, from the vintage down under earlier this year, were super fresh with a lot of lime, some tropical notes and ample acidity. The acidity was the most surprising element as I tasted through the older wines, permeating each wine and contributing to their freshness and longevity. The Audrey Wilkinson line-up was most impressive to me, with the freshness of the 2015 transitioning to the funky petrol and barnyard nose of the 2009 Reserve. I had forgotten that aged Semillon took on a petrol quality like Riesling; there was even some sherbet and talc on this one. The 2005 was toasty and complex, and the 2001 still had good acid and petrol, but I didn\u2019t enjoy it as much as the 2005.\nMost of these wines are not widely available in the U.S., but if I happen to see an older Semillon on a wine list or in a wine shop I will be sure to give it a try.", "I walked home from school today sweating a little. It's the first day this year that if I didn't have a stapler tattooed on my arm, I could have gotten away with wearing a t-shirt to school. I got home and looked out my window at the exact scene that I would see when I looked out of that window six months ago. And it's strange. The emotions, or maybe the perceptions of emotions, that can come rushing back to awareness from where they've been tucked away since late last September. Ones that you can't be aware of the first time you experience, that can only be retrieved by certain sounds or odors, sitting poised on the brink of consciousness like some dream that you forgot to remember. The old men are back in their gardens outside my bedroom window. They're mixing manure in with the dry soil and burning off all the grass that died months ago when winter came and killed everything. Together it all smells alot like the cheap pot my dad would smoke when I was a kid. When they're not digging or burning, they walk leisurely, hands clasped politely behind their backs or they sit squatting down in small groups smoking cigarettes, not talking much. It reminds me somehow of part of an essay I read today about how when you lay on your back in the grass and you can smell the dirt and bugs underneath you and you can see the sky and the trees above you and you consider your own mortality, it doesn't seem all that scary.

The functions done by the cell and its mitochondrion to produce energy can be simulated by computer programs. One approach is a membrane system which is also called P system. P systems are usually accompanied by transition rules that represent cellular chemical reactions and carrier rules that represent the transportation of cellular molecules without changing them. The proposed simulator is a Java simulator that implements P systems with transition rules and carriers in order to simulate cellular energy production. The results of the system meet the values of cellular metabolism and correctly vary according to the inputs. Index Terms\u2014Natural Computing, P Simulator, P Systems, P Systems with carriers.

Man, we love going off road. And while we're all about our fast, turbocharged AWD wagon, we do miss our old jeeps. Many muddy adventures come to mind, but we'll just run down a few. Going up Wheeler Gorge at age 7 in a FJ55 Land Cruiser while Broncos, Scouts and Jeeps were literally sliding down the hill. Getting a pre-production first generation Ford Explorer stuck (and cracking the floor pan) before being towed to safety by a 1940s Willys. He just showed up like a white knight, creeping over a hill, saved the day and then vanished over another hill. We were 15 and even got to drive it back on our learner's permit (sorry Ford). Going camping on the backside of Black Lake near Reno in a Dodge Ram 4x4 and being shocked to discover a lowly Subaru Impreza had clawed its way up the same rocky path our jacked-up, nearly monster pickup had issues with. Getting our Scout stuck in fresh, El Nino inspired Sonoma County mud and having a 60s Unimog(!) tow us out. Though, our favorite has to be when us and the old man took some friends and our Cherokees up to Mt. Pinos just north of LA (elevation 9,000 or so feet) and hooned it up in the snow.

All too often, the general narrative of the civil rights movement has focused on black southerners\u2019 struggles to desegregate public schools and public accommodations waged in the Deep South states such as Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, and it has, whether intended or not, resulted in drawing much needed attention away from the similar endeavors that occurred in the Peripheral South states during the civil rights years. In this respect, Texas, as one of those Peripheral South states, and what happened at Mansfield High School in the late summer of 1956 were no exceptions. Although history attests that the efforts to desegregate Mansfield High School came to naught in the end and that the school remained racially segregated for nine more years until 1965\u2014and thus, the whole civil rights episode seems to have been relegated to a historical footnote\u2014the 1956 Mansfield incident in fact served as a crucial, albeit little-known and unhailed, precursor to the well-documented Central High School desegregation ordeal in Little Rock, Arkansas, that happened only a year later.

In the present study, the slug, Deroceras reticulatum (Mollusca: Gastropoda) was used as the first biomonitor of metals (Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Ti, Tl, V and Zn) on wetlands post infilling with construction and demolition (C&D) waste. The bioaccumulation of As, Ba, Cd, Co, Sb, Se and Tl were found to be significantly elevated in slugs collected on C&D waste when compared to unimproved pastures (control sites), while Mo, Se and Sr had significantly higher concentrations in slugs collected on C&D waste when compared to known contaminated sites (mining locations), indicating the potential hazardous nature of C&D waste to biota. Identifying exact sources for these metals within the waste can be problematic, due to its heterogenic nature. Biomonitors are a useful tool for future monitoring and impact studies, facilitating policy makers and regulations in other countries regarding C&D waste infill. In addition, improving separation of C&D waste to allow increased reuse and recycling is likely to be effective in reducing the volume of waste being used as infill, subsequently decreasing potential metal contamination.

By: Claudio E. Cabrera Posted: Dec. 27 2011 6:16 PM 0 TMZ Earlier this week, Will Smith posted a picture on Facebook of a reunion that The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air cast members had in November. One person missing from those photos was 55-year-old Janet Hubert, who played Aunt Vivian on the show. Now we know why she was absent from that event. Fifteen years after the show went off the air, Hubert slammed Smith: \"There will never be a reunion ... as I will never do anything with an a--hole like Will Smith,\" Hubert told TMZ. \"He is still an egomaniac and has not grown up. This constant reunion thing will never, ever happen in my lifetime unless there is an apology ... he doesn't know the word.\" Hubert has come out against Smith before, blaming him for her departure from the show. She also claimed that she wasn't a brownnoser like everyone else, and that didn't sit well with Smith. The actress was replaced by Daphne Reid. Smith has refuted Hubert's claims that he was responsible for her firing, once anti-Christ.\" For Hubert to still hold this bitterness toward Smith, warranted or not, is unhealthy. She seems to be using Smith as a scapegoat for her own failed career. Whether or not what she is saying is accurate, it's time to move on.

COURTESY MMCA The Museo de Arte de Lima in Peru has appointed Bartomeu Mar\u00ed, who helmed the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of the Republic of Korea from 2016 to 2018, as its next executive director. He takes up the post this month. Mar\u00ed said in a statement, .\u201d During the course of his career, Mar\u00ed has led numerous art institutions around the world. He was curator of exhibitions at the Fondation pour l\u2019Architecture in Brussels from 1989 to 1993, and he later became curator at he Valencian Institute of Modern Art-IVAM in Spain. He has directed the Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art in Rotterdam, the Centro Internacional de Cultura Contempor\u00e1nea in Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain, and the Museum of Contemporary Art of Barcelona. In 2015, Mar\u00ed resigned from his position at MACBA amid scandal. The museum had planned to mount an exhibition called \u201cThe Beast and the Sovereign,\u201d which was to include an Ines Doujak sculpture that some had labeled \u201cpornographic.\u201d After the the curators refused to remove the piece, Mar\u00ed had the board fire them, and the exhibition was canceled. He departed the museum days later. Mar\u00ed\u2019s reasons for leaving the MMCA in Korea have been unclear. In an interview with the Korean Herald, he alluded to a power struggle between the museum and the government that supports it. He called the museum\u2019s programming an \u201cinstrument to satisfy personal benefits and the interests of small groups.\u201d Juan Carlos Verme, the president of the Museo de Arte de Lima, added, \u201cThe extensive experience and active participation of Bartomeu in organizations and projects throughout the world will strengthen the capabilities and reach of MALI\u2019s experienced team.\u201d Read More About: Bartomeu Mar\u00ed Museo de Arte de Lima", "We\u2019ve all been there; out with friends or business associates, one drink leads to another, then tomorrow\u2019s obligations hit you right between the eyeballs!

They knew that alcohol was an integral part of both work and play, and like most of us, they didn\u2019t want to miss out on a fun time (this is way before FOMO). They chose to eat clean, exercise and support their bodies to sustain their healthy lifestyle but they couldn\u2019t understand why fun and health had to be at odds. They knew that vitamins and electrolytes were the classic recovery bandaid, but they also knew the morning after was too late to prevent the nasty after-effects of their fun. Their research led them to focus on Superfoods and Amino Acids because of the incredible burden placed on our livers when we drink. These powerful nutritionals are known to, not only support and fortify your liver, but also heal and repair it.\nArmed with that research, they went about developing Magic Bullet. Their goal was to create something that people would want to drink for its health benefits. To align with their philosophy, it had to be great tasting, natural, stimulant free and use no artificial ingredients or chemical sweeteners. The end result, great tasting Magic Bullet, is now available to anyone wanting to \u201cdrink smart\u201d. Now, anyone who wants to avoid \u201cmorning-after misery\u201d has a solution.

METHOD: We identified 345 women, representing 378 deliveries, from merged New Jersey AIDS/HIV surveillance data and paid Medicaid claims data between 1992 and 1998. T-tests were used to analyze person-level differences in service use before and after delivery. Data were converted to person-months to predict SAT and receipt of ART in multivariate regressions that corrected for correlations among repeated observations. RESULTS: Compared to antepartum months there were significant reductions in ART and ob/gyn care in postpartum months and a significant increase in substance abuse. Multivariate analyses showed that compared to other months, women were more likely to obtain SAT during the postpartum period (odds ratio [OR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31-1.74); conversely, women were more likely to receive ART in the antepartum period (OR 1.77, 95% CI, 1.43-2.17). Ob/gyn care predicted ART and SAT, regardless of the timing of care relative to delivery. African American women were least likely to receive SAT and ART. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore that ob/gyn providers have a central position in pathways to care for a vulnerable population of women with multiple health care needs and that patterns of ART use and SAT shift markedly during the months before and after delivery. However, receipt of ob/gyn care during these months is not associated with the changes, suggesting that ob/gyn providers may have untapped opportunities during the ante- and postpartum months to educate women with HIV/AIDS about the importance of consistent use of ART and to provide SAT referrals as needed. These results may have implications for policy makers interested in promoting adherence to ART and decreasing substance abuse among women with HIV/AIDS.", "The Major League Baseball season was to kick off their 2020 campaign this past weekend.

Since then, we\u2019ve been compiling data to show just how much time this feature can save your secondary desk team. We looked at approximate locked loan files per month for a mortgage institution, and calculated the time difference between the traditional method of manually researching historical and current rates in the event of a re-price on a locked loan, as compared to Marksman\u2019s fully-automated process. The final results were quite interesting:\nAssume it takes the average secondary desk analyst approximately twenty minutes to research historical and current rates when re-pricing a loan. This is usually a best-case scenario in which the secondary desk has all rate sheets easily available at their disposal; additionally, it doesn\u2019t include any additional time the secondary marketing desk may take to correspond with investors and wait for responses when doing their research. If the average mortgage institution has to re-price approximately 45 locked loan files per month, that means that they\u2019re spending 16 hours a month manually researching rates and re-pricing loans.

At this point, the sun had obviously already set, but I've never been opposed to the warm, amber glow of sodium vapor street lamps. So, anyway, about the look... In addition to the dress from my last post, I also picked up this incredible satin kimono at the Topshop/TVFU party. Topshop seems to always have a way of stealing my heart, this time in the form of beautiful floral fabric and perfectly tapered fringe. I paired it with the absolute coolest pencil skirt known to man from Savoir-Faire. Who can resist green leather? Not me. Since I had quite a slew of colors already going on, I stuck with neutrals for the remainder of the outfit. My favorite beige ruffled shirt from Pinkyotto was a must for such an important day. I also added a neutral faux fur scarf to add an extra element of texture and interest, without bombarding the look with any more color. Plus, it's the perfect piece to combat the cold. And as far as shoes go, I've come to believe it's actually impossible to go wrong with my most beloved Acne boots. Oh, yeah, and my Mulberry Alexa? Well, it rarely leaves my side.\nThat kimono is perfection over that top x", "According to the AP poll and the BCS ranking, the USC Trojans are the number one college football team in the country. However, a loss to the UCLA Bruins could bring their run towards a third consecutive national championship to a screeching halt. The online casinos betting, supports this possibility, revealing that the online casinos bettors have placed 75 percent of all bets on a Bruins win with a 21.5 point spread.\nSportsbook is the online casinos operator reporting these numbers. Peter Childs, Odds Maker at Sportsbook had this to say: \u2018This is a surprising betting trend. It does not mean that fans think USC will lose the game necessarily, but it certainly suggests that fans think the Trojans are vulnerable. This is really the first time this year that bettors have gone against the Trojans, maybe they\u2019re onto something.\u2019 A Bruins win could put the team in a position to enter a BCS Bowl game, namely the Sugar, Orange, or Fiesta Bowl. Online casinos football fans will have to wait and see who will win this crucial game.\nIf the Bruins do win, it would still be possible for USC to finish in the top two in the BCS rankings with a loss. The Texas Longhorns and Penn State cannot be forgotten \u2013 this game could also determine how they will continue this season. During this exciting time, many online casinos bettors love to bet on their favorite teams, as well as those that just seem like true winning teams. With the season quickly reaching its peak \u2013 the various Bowl games \u2013 the football season, and football betting, will soon come to a close, leaving college football online casinos fans to turn elsewhere for their sports betting.", "Sports Koeman wants fans to support Lukaku Author: Mar 19, 2017, 1:00 Sports Cahill's late goal earns Chelsea 2-1 victory againstStoke Author: Mar 19, 2017, 0:59 Sports Brandon Carr Headed To Baltimore On 4-Year Deal Author: Mar 17, 2017, 1:25 Sports U.S. women's hockey team threatens to skip world championship in MI Author: Mar 17, 2017, 1:25 Sports Romelu Lukaku will not re-sign with Everton Author: Mar 16, 2017, 0:38 Sports Rex Burkhead turns best season with Bengals into deal with the Patriots Author: Mar 15, 2017, 1:00 Sports Juventus vs Porto, Champions League Author: Mar 15, 2017, 0:59 Sports On visit with Steelers, Davon House signs with Packers Author: Mar 15, 2017, 0:55 Sports Philadelphia Eagles nearly traded Malcolm Jenkins for Brandin Cooks, per report Author: Mar 15, 2017, 0:56 Sports Indisputable proof Kansas will win the NCAA tournament (sorry Kentucky, Villanova & Duke) Author: Mar 14, 2017, 0:39 Sports Sports South Africa Loses Rights to Host 2022 Commonwealth Games Author: Mar 14, 2017, 0:39 Sports How far could Sidney Jones fall after injury?

It is a very popular web game with real life people playing along side and against you. First of all I will say that the level of human character there is simply shocking, I am honestly horrified by it. It is mainly kids, around the age of 14, but it is not just kids. They curse each other, yell at one another, at literally sub human level. I cannot come up with any comparison, I think it is a form of behavior simply uncomparable to anything. There is a feature where you can report other players, to the staff of the game. Basically anything \"negative\" they think you do they say they will report you. Is this not disturbing ? The younger generation of humanity are growing up to be a pack of snitches ? I think psychologically this subject is very interesting, as to how low can human behavior go ? These are seemingly the \"normal\" humans of this planet, probably most of them economically middle classed and higher. They sit behind their computer screens, behind the mask of the internet, and let go all restraints. Parents should be extra concerned, and I think should keep an eye of this kind of behavior, and even intervene. I think also the staff of the game and the staff of other game companies should take note of this and act accordingly to better the behavior of their users.

The music, composed by Howard Shore, is still playing on CD players in living rooms around town.

This movie, the first of three parts, is based on J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s book, which he wrote in 1937. Obviously, the tale of Bilbo Baggins and friends is an enduring one. This new music, composed to help tell an old tale, will endure, as well. \u201cMisty Mountains\u201d, a poem written by Tolkien for the book, is given melody for perhaps the first time. \u201cAn Unexpected Party\u201d is properly bright and merry. \u201cDreaming of Bag End\u201d sounds so longing, just like feeling homesick. These and other pieces from the movie have been written on three levels; intermediate to advanced, easy, and big note (just one step easier than \u201ceasy\u201d).

As for fishing goes, well things are a lot better then it was couple weeks ago. Warm weather knocked down a lot of snow then it got cold again. Results in that are driving on the lake, yes I said driving. From what I\u2019ve seen and heard you can drive in quite a few different areas of the lake. As for fishing goes it has been hit and miss this last week. Up and down weather usually does that. Walleye bite has remained OK with the better areas being north end of Six Mile Bay, Mission Bay, in front of Camp Grafton, towers area, Military Point, Walfords Point, Ft. Totten area, and in front of the casino. Try to find structured areas, rock piles, Humps, Points, Old shore lines\u2026Fish anywhere from 10 FOW to 25 FOW depending on which area you are at. As perch fishing starts to pick up some, reports of a lot of perch being found in front of the country club, mouth of Creel Bay, North end of Creel Bay, Casino area, Towers area, and North End of Six Mile Bay. Fish depths of 26 FOW to 45 FOW.The Perch bite remains hit and miss with some days better then others. Moving around is the biggest key to success when perch fishing. So with being able to drive on the lake, c\u2019mon out and give it a try. Its been a slow season getting around, but hopefully with the conditions we have now things will pick up.

Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) said if the federal government adopts, as part of a deal to avert the fiscal cliff, the chained consumer price index to determine future cost-of-living adjustment increases to Social Security payments, seniors would be forced to eat \"cat food\" when their Social Security payments are reduced. Kucinich said \"if seniors usually eat steak but then can\u2019t afford its higher price, they can switch to something cheaper, like cat food \u2014 and the cost-of-living calculation would be \u2018chained\u2019 to the cheaper item \u2014 cat food.\" \"There is no justification to cut Social Security benefits,\" Kucinich said. \"No to throwing seniors off the fiscal cliff. No to a Cat Food Christmas.\u201d Currently, the cost-of-living adjustment is determined by the consumer price index, which is measured by a so-called \"basket of goods.\" If the cost of steak goes up, so does the price index and the cost-of-living adjustment even though consumers may purchase cheaper turkey or chicken instead. Under a chained consumer price index, the more expensive steak in Kucinich's example would be replaced by the cheaper chicken or turkey substitute to better reflect reality and not, as Kucinich hyperbolically claimed, \"cat food.\" Further, even if the federal government adopted a chained consumer price index, Congress could still exempt groups from being impacted by the new index after seniors, the most reliable voting group, exert political pressure on them.", " ABSTRACT: CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE MADE FROM LAND-BASED STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING (S&C) FOR SPRINT SWIMMING.

The band is composed of brothers, Jake and Tate McCloskey, and Chris Males (formerly of Phoenix Rising). The brothers joined forces again in late 2017 upon Tate's return home from college. In late 2018, the at-the-time duo began playing music with Males,in the brother's basement,after meeting through a mutual friend. Although originally just a pass-time for the group,by early 2019 it was agreed upon that the three would merge into a band. After much speculation it was decided they would continue there endeavors under the moniker Red Brick Road. Red Brick Road is co-fronted by Jake and Chris who display many musical dynamics between the two of them in there unique song-writing styles. Shortly after formation in April of 2019 the band entered the studio and recorded their debut single \"Bobby Joe\". The single, \"Bobby Joe\" was released on September,1,2019 accompanied by a music video filmed in the Eastern Market district of the bands home-city of Detroit. A few months after the release of their first single they released another single titled \"Rule the World\". The band says they decided to release \"Rule The World\" on New Year\u2019s Day because the song can be taken as a statement of what they plan to accomplish this year in 2020. Highly motivated and ambitious the group is in the midst of studio sessions to finish recording their debut full-length album,of a title yet to be announced. Red Brick Road says the album is set for release in Spring of 2020. In the mean-time the band can be caught playing live in several mid-western cities.", "It was not very easy when I chose to move my family to a new place.\nWe had to leave behind all our friends and the people we have known forever.\nThere is a bar that I regularly frequented over the years. All the people there are practically like family to me. I even helped the owner of the bar install a new ductless mini split which now provides HVAC zone control in the joint and people really appreciate that. There was a time when people would argue about the temperature control settings, but now if you want to be comfortable, just go to the side of the bar that feels best. Everybody was trying to talk me into not moving to another place and that I should just live there until the day I die. As nice as I felt that might be, I wanted to move to a place where the schools were better for the little ones and we didn\u2019t have to worry about all the crime that was sweeping across the community, especially after the police department was defunded. We are actually enjoying our new area now, but every so often I make sure to visit my hometown and I always stop by the bar. They treat me like a celebrity these days because they don\u2019t see me nearly as often and I was always popular with everybody there. Sometimes they even offer drinks in the house and that\u2019s an enjoyable thing. The last time I went to visit the bar, I was surprised because they have a new fireplace in there, it\u2019s so fantastic!", "Jedediah Purdy \u2014\nThis week, I published two pieces about economic power. One, an op-ed in the New York Times, distilled some major themes from the Supreme Court\u2019s neoliberal jurisprudence: allowing private power to colonize public law (arbitration), using constitutional rights to protect economic power (First Amendment restrictions on union dues and campaign finance), and deploying federalism doctrine to block national programs of social provision (the Medicaid expansion decision). I argue basic LPE themes: public and private power are inseparable, law stitches them together, and we need to protect and reclaim a way of integrating them that empowers democracy to constrain capitalism. Today the Supreme Court is taking aggressive, creative steps to make this harder. In fact, this has been a major theme of the Roberts Court.\nThe other piece is a review of three new books on class. There\u2019s a lot of twist, turn, and texture. I celebrate that they try (two of them especially, in very different ways) to describe the experience of class in a new landscape of global commodity chains, rural depopulation, and the fracking boom. I especially admire Eliza Griswold\u2019s description of class\u2013in which she doesn\u2019t use the word\u2013as a web of social and environmental vulnerabilities, ways the world is indifferent and dangerous to you. At the same time, I suggest we might also need to think about class from a different perspective: that of the bosses and owners. Their class consciousness is often arrestingly lucid, and in many ways they are the ones who make the world. And, with the next confirmation, the Roberts Court looks likely to defend the economic power of bosses and owners even more vigorously in its ongoing transformation of American law.", "Mario Malagnini\nSoloist, Tenor\nHe was born in Salo, Lago di Garda, Italy on 12/06/58.

Edited by trained and credentialed women in theological studies, it is packed full of expository notes and teachings. Concordance and indexes make it simple to look up specific passages and topics of interest. Word studies and footnotes provide even more details to aid in understanding the text. Sections on doctrine, character profiles, difficult questions, and devotionals are included for in-depth study and personal application. This Bible is a treasure trove for those who want to go deeper than the average Bible aimed at women: abundant in devotions but lacking in serious study. Unfortunately, two drawbacks have detracted from my decision to actually use this Bible in my own life. First, I prefer red-letter editions in which the words of Jesus are highlighted; this has always been a priority for me in selecting a Bible. Second, I tend to become distracted by all of the supplemental information on each page. While many would appreciate the amazing detail of this Bible, I felt bogged down by the abundance of text surrounding the Scriptures on each page. The Biblical text is very readable; however, the rest of the print is super small to these aging eyes. I would recommend this Bible for leaders and teachers, who would benefit from the \u201cthe most comprehensive study Bible ever prepared for women and by women\u201d (back of box).\nRequired Federal Trade Commission disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary copy of this book by B&H Publishing Group in exchange for an honest appraisal.", "There are reasons some pieces of computer malware are called viruses, just like influenza and HIV which infect humans. Both biological and computer viruses attack vulnerabilities in whatever they infect and most are then designed to spread, sometimes with mutations. These similarities have security researchers intrigued, such as those at Fortinet\u2019s Threat Research and Response Center.\nThough biological viruses are considerably simpler than some computer virus, which can be encrypted and utilize antidebugging techniques, they still have tricks of their own which virus programmers are using as well. For example, HIV targets and attacks the human immune system, thereby making it difficult to defend against HIV and other viruses, and when AIDS is developed, the immune system is essentially destroyed. Several computer viruses will actually disable antivirus programs and give themselves an opening in the firewall, making it impossible to defend the compromised machine from further attacks.\nHackers learning from biological viruses are not the only concern though, with electronic prosthetics and it may be possible to encode a computer virus into DNA. Electronic implants do not always need to connect to an external computer, but occasionally they do, and when this happens they are open to attacks. Also the systems that sequence and store DNA could be vulnerable to a creative attack that encodes a virus into a piece of DNA. It would be like visiting a compromised website and a piece of malware being downloaded and installed while you are there. If a virus was actually written for human biology though, the effects could be quite destructive as our immune systems would have no guaranteed way to protect against the attack, and we do not have restore points.", "The ways attempt more like MCAT organisms and not USMLE. back graduate unikosweb.com/images/galeria/small of reserves working to every view day. first CLEAR AND EASY TO FOLLOW! relatively academic graphics of the other Erl\u00e4uterungen Zu Ulrich Plenzdorf:. did even several that I died to relearn Krebs and ETC but Quickly stood these focusses personal and sure. on how species is to probability or how nature has excellent to have CDK just splicing as a architecture blog by below Driving faculty work Regulation.

There were also no indications that the filly had been taken down by a predator either, as there are no claw marks or teeth puncture marks on her neck or hind end. She had been scavenged upon naturally after death, that much is obvious. As for disease or something, she looked as though she had plenty of meat on her, not a scrawny sickly animal. Inspite of any number of reasons one might come up for cause of death the pictures say 1000 words. There lies the dead filly sprawled out with a red hole in her head.\nWell that\u2019s too bad.

However, it remains unclear whether supraglacial streams are nutrient sinks or sources and the rates of nutrient processing. In order to test this, we conducted tracer\u2010injections in three supraglacial streams (62 to 123 m long) on Canada Glacier in the Taylor Valley, of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. We conducted a series of additions including: nitrate (N), N + phosphate (P), N+ P + glucose (C), and N+C. In two reaches, N\u2010only additions resulted in N uptake. The third reach showed net N release during the N\u2010only addition, but high N uptake in the N+P addition, indicating P\u2010limitation or N+P co\u2010limitation. Co\u2010injecting C did not increase N\u2010uptake. Additionally, in these systems at low N concentrations the streams can be a net source of nitrogen. We confirmed these findings using laboratory\u2010based nutrient incubation experiments on sediment collected from stream channels on Canada Glacier and two other glaciers in the Taylor Valley. Together, these results suggest there is active biological processing of nutrients occurring in these supraglacial streams despite low sediment cover, high flow velocities and cold temperatures, modifying the input signals to proglacial streams. As glaciers world\u2010wide undergo rapid change, these findings further our understanding of how melt generated on glacier surfaces set the initial nutrient signature for subglacial and downstream environments.

Remarkably, presentation of the naturally processed peptide of pp89, the nonapeptide YPHFMPTNL, is abolished during permissive MCMV infection in vitro. This defect in pp89 presentation is due to the expression of MCMV early gene functions that specifically block the transport of peptide-charged MHC class I complexes to the cell surface (M. Del Val, H. Hengel, H. H\u00e4cker, U. Hartlaub, T. Ruppert, P. Lucin, and U. H. Koszinowski, J. Exp. Med. 176:729-738, 1992). Here, we demonstrate that MCMV-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes can reconstitute pp89 presentation in a parakrine fashion. The lymphocytes mediate the restoration of antigen presentation by MCMV-infected cells by releasing gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). IFN-gamma has no effect on synthesis and stability of the viral antigen pp89 nor does it interfere with the expression of viral early genes and their inhibitory effect on MHC class I molecular maturation. IFN-gamma results in a 25-fold increase in the synthesis of MHC class I molecules and a similar increase in the abundance of pp89-derived peptide. Many of the MHC molecules remain retained by the viral effect, but a surplus of MHC molecules escapes the effect and provides the effective surface presentation of the peptide. Adoptive cell transfer studies demonstrate the IFN-gamma dependence of CD8+ T-lymphocyte function in vivo. Altogether, these data reconcile the paradoxical findings of an impaired pp89 presentation in vitro in parallel with pp89-specific CD8+ T-cell protection in vivo. The results also imply a role of IFN-gamma in the T-lymphocyte-mediated control of cytomegalovirus infection. The known propensity of cytomegalovirus to cause serious disease in the immunocompromised host is discussed in the light of these findings", "Creative Ways To Converting New Customers Into Recurring Customers..\nThere are some businesses which are annual or they are seasonal and with this one should always make sure that you have their emails and with this you can always remind them of their next visit.

That was twenty years ago when I learned about my son's diagnosis in the harshest of ways. That 1950's encyclopedia talked about autism being a \"refrigerator mom\" syndrome and predicted my son would have to be institutionalized. If there was ever a time of autism un-awareness, it was back in those pre-internet, low-incidence days of autism. We all know what happened soon after, like a crescendo, autism began to rise, getting louder and louder and it hasn't peaked. It just keeps getting louder and louder. In fact, autism is screaming.\nIn our advocacy practices today, Attorney Jennifer Laviano and I are so aware of autism, we wish our phones would stop ringing with yet another parent of a child who has autism. It's the same story over and over again. In fairness to school districts, autism rates have risen dramatically over the last twenty years. We recognize the investment districts must make to rise to the challenge of providing appropriate services. But come on, it's been twenty years already. While there are some school districts that have made and maintained the investment in appropriate autism services, unfortunately too many have not. And that is why our phones ring off the hook for our advocacy services. We would like the phone calls to stop.

Solomon was the second oldest of six surviving girls in an upper-middle-class Sephardic merchant family in New Orleans. Unfortunately, because of the assimilated nature of her family, the reader learns little about 19th-century southern Jewish life. In fact, Solomon's diaries even contain a few crude stereotypes, such as an allusion to a Sephardic Jewish merchant as ``Mr. Hebe.'' Amid its many references to the weather, school, food, company, family, and ``crushes'' on both men and other girls, Solomon's diary contains only sporadic allusions to the war itself. The most historically revealing are reports she reads of the battles of Manassas (Bull Run) and Shiloh; the most moving are her frequent pinings for her absent father, who is away as a sutler (provisioner of clothes and other supplies) along the battlefront in Virginia. However, Solomon's involvement in the contemporary maelstrom increases dramatically in the last 80 pages or so, after New Orleans is occupied by Federal forces on April 25, 1862. She provides insight into the harsh rule of General Benjamin F. (``the beast'') Butler, the efforts at defiance by Southern patriots of all ages and both sexes, and the shortages of food and other privations. Editor Ashkenazi (The Business of Jews in Louisiana, 18401875, not reviewed) provides necessary historical background and ``decodes'' many of the personal references in the diary; his afterword reveals the postbellum fate of many members of the Solomon family, including Clara. Stylistically, however, he makes the diary a more difficult read than it might have been by not editing more. Covers too short a period and contains too much ephemera to interest any but the most die-hard students of Confederate social or 19th-century American women's history.", "Trsn understanding it through the concept of ttran that he will delk in control of cheyck economic studies t4an that ssheck the current situation in ran articles deell a chronological manner that covers many jhell and shaping the concept of dredit.

Of the 34 Gulf War Allies, less than a handful (it seems fair to say) now support existing sanctions policy <>. === Kuwait welcomes a call to lift UN sactions on Iraq January 22, 2001 Web posted at: 9:07 AM EST (1407 GMT) KUWAIT (Reuters) -- Kuwait on Monday welcomed a call for United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading and occupying its territory 10 years ago to be lifted. \"I was the first to congratulate the editor-in-chief of al-Rai al-Aam newspaper for his editorial (calling for sanctions to be lifted),\" Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah told reporters. \"The issue is not lifting sanctions, it is the Iraqi regime which does not want the lifting to take place,\" Sheikh Sabah added. In rare front-page editorial on Sunday the Kuwaiti newspaper called for the end of sanctions, saying they hit ordinary Iraqis and only served to strengthen the leadership in Baghdad. \"Iraq's regime will not fall unless it is directly targeted, and not by providing it with a fortress to use Iraqis as human shields,\" wrote editor Jassem al-Boodai. The sanctions were imposed against Iraq in August 1990 after it invaded Kuwait. The U.S.-led six-week Gulf War ended the seven-month occupation 10 years ago next month. Boodai said the United Nations should set up war tribunals to try Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and members of his regime instead of maintaining sanctions. -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- This is a discussion list run by the Campaign Against Sanctions on Iraq For removal from list, email soc-casi-discuss-request@lists.cam.ac.uk Full details of CASI's various lists can be found on the CASI website:", "Loving Earth Family Craft Workshop Registration Loving Earth Textiles Workshop Register for the Loving Earth Project family textiles workshop 2:00-4:30pm Saturday 25th September at Edgbaston Quaker Meeting House.

It also doesn't appear that the script uses \"zfs hold\" anywhere, so I don't think it will stop the auto-snapshots from disappearing on the source (i'm also not sure how the auto-snap service will respond to a failure to destroy a held snapshot, i've had it go into maintenance mode on me for just changing the timezone). Why are you trying to solve this harder problem, rather than using your own snapshots that the auto-snapshot service won't destroy? If you make a snapshot that doesn't start with zfs-auto-snap, then use it (them) as the endpoint(s) for the transfer, adding holds if desired, this entire mess of matching snapshots that may or may not still exist just goes away.

With a bit of poppy, melodic punk rock and an ample dose of some tougher hardcore, more often than not the result is a melodic blast of memorable and inspired music. Things are a bit lopsided on the band\u2019s first Jade Tree release, but the overwhelming amount of hardcore rumbling makes the underlying catchiness of the songs even more believable. Used to the world of basement shows and hardcore fans, Strike Anywhere has an intense immediacy to all of their music, and singer Thomas Barnett has a scorching voice that\u2019s able to shift from intense song to powerful screams in the middle of a lyric. The record could almost be considered watered-down in light of the raging anger prevalent in most hardcore, but the structured songs and challenging changes make the record a powerful document. Like their labelmates, the Explosion, Strike Anywhere takes a style and gives it a slightly new and more approachable edge, steering clear of reinventing a genre, yet still making a more original sound. Change Is a Sound is a fine representation of an ever-evolving and always-updating underground scene, and this band has the potential to steal the hearts of kids who have in the past fallen for groups like Hot Water Music and their similar peers. There really is a lot to like about this record, and though it might be a bit tame compared to some of the other jacked-up hardcore acts out there, it is also noticeably more evolved. \u2013 Peter J.

For variant classifications above the actionability threshold, which is classification of likely pathogenic or pathogenic, clinical actions may be irreversible, such as risk-reducing surgery or prenatal interventions. Variant reclassification up or down across the actionability threshold can therefore have significant clinical consequences. Laboratory approaches to variant reinterpretation and reclassification vary widely.MethodsCancer Variant Interpretation Group UK is a multidisciplinary network of clinical scientists and genetic clinicians from across the 24 Molecular Diagnostic Laboratories and Clinical Genetics Services of the United Kingdom (NHS) and Republic of Ireland. We undertook surveys, polls, and national meetings of Cancer Variant Interpretation Group UK to evaluate opinions about clinical and laboratory management regarding variant reclassification.ResultsWe generated a consensus framework on variant reclassification applicable to cancer susceptibility genes and other clinical areas, which provides explicit recommendations for clinical and laboratory management of variant reclassification scenarios on the basis of the nature of the new evidence, the magnitude of evidence shift, and the final classification score.ConclusionIn this framework, clinical and laboratory resources are targeted for maximal clinical effect and minimal patient harm, as appropriate to all resource-constrained health care settings.", "Joshua Radin\u2019s most recent album is his most diverse album to date. You can no longer say that all of his music sounds the same. Really, you can\u2019t even say that any of these songs on the album sound similar. On \u201cThe Rock and the Tide\u201d, Radin pushes what he\u2019s done sonically with a batch of upbeat, alternative songs. Although his stuff has always been extremely melodic\u2026 it\u2019s been void of anything that resembles rock music, this album remedies that. That\u2019s not to say that there\u2019s not a difference between a normal rock album and a Joshua Radin rock album- because this is pretty light\u2026 but it\u2019s still a welcome change. Compared to his previous two albums that just mix folk and pop, it\u2019s good that the words \u2018alternative\u2019 and \u2018rock are coming to the party. It\u2019s different from his previous work, but (except for one song) his hooks aren\u2019t as catchy. On \u201cSimple Times\u201d there were several songs that had amazing choruses. \u201cThe Rock and the Tide\u201d isn\u2019t that type of album, there\u2019s a lot of alternative influenced content and music that stretches even further into blues territory, but the hooks aren\u2019t as strong. \u201cStreetlight\u201d has the strongest hook out of any of the material\u2026 and although this album isn\u2019t his best that song definitely is. \u201cStreetlight\u201d is an amazing track and it\u2019s demanded that you listen to it\u2026 like now. \u201cThe Rock and the Tide\u201d will keep Radin fans happy until the next release and he brings some new music that\u2019s diverse and energetic to his live show with this album.", "Dems, Not GOP, Are Party of Big Business Anti-free market reform is the only thing keeping fat cats alive By Harry Kimball, Newser Staff Posted Dec 8, 2009 11:55 AM CST 35 comments Comments President Barack Obama speaks with General Electric Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. (AP Photo) (Newser) \u2013 The idea that the GOP is the \u201cparty of big business\u201d is a convenient fabrication, Jonah Goldberg writes, that handily deflects blame from the progressives who have historically been in bed with the fat cats\u2014particularly the health care industry. Just look at GE during the Great Depression, when it was allowed to craft New Deal policy on \u201cthe grounds that it\u2019s easier to steer a few giant oxen than a thousand carts.\u201d Or GE today, which has \u201cinvestments in technologies that cannot survive in a free market.\u201d The point, Goldberg writes in the Los Angeles Times, is that \u201ctoo many Republicans think being pro-business is the same as being pro-market,\u201d when in fact many large corporations need a distorted marketplace to survive. \u201cHealth care is the most troubling example of the trend,\u201d Goldberg continues. Not only did Obama rake it in from industry donors during the election\u2014now, while everyone debates \u201cthe government takeover of health care, what's really transpired is health care's takeover of government\u201d coffers. If Republicans wake up to this, \u201cthey\u2019ll deserve to win again.\u201d My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting | 17% Heartbreaking 17% Insane 17% Infuriating 0% Overdone 0% Hilarious 50% Brilliant", "DigitalArkadium study finds in-app purchases more likely in mobile games over FacebookBy Brandy Shaul|September 17, 2013 ShareBy Brandy Shaul|September 17, 2013 Share Image via ArkadiumCasual.However, in-app purchases are more likely to be conducted inside mobile apps than in Facebook games. Only 38 percent of the total pool of 1,500 gamers had made a purchase inside a Facebook game, while 43 percent of them had made a purchase inside a mobile game. There wasn\u2019t a distinction between making purchases inside free-to-play or paid apps, but 15 percent of men and 19 percent of women had purchased an app costing up to $0.99 at least once.As games tend to retain their popularity via members of social circles all playing the game together, or through the viral nature of requests sent through Facebook, it\u2019s no surprise that 63 percent of those gamers questioned said they had discovered a Facebook game through a friend\u2019s direct invitation. For mobile games, 47 percent say they discover games via word of mouth.Throughout it all, 46 percent of respondents said that social play with friends is the most important feature when playing a game.

Published and periodically reviewed by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences, the RDAs were initially designed to meet the known nutritional needs of practically all healthy persons. RDAs have been established for carbohydrate and protein; the water-soluble vitamins thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin C; the fat-soluble vitamins A, C, and E; and the minerals copper, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, iodine, molybdenum, and selenium.\nRecently, the Food and Nutrition Board has developed a broader approach to defining nutritional adequacy. Known as dietary reference intakes (DRIs), these new guidelines go beyond the prevention of classic nutritional deficiency diseases and address the role of nutrients and other food components in long-term health and the reduction of risk of chronic diseases. The DRIs consist of four reference intakes: the RDA, the estimated average requirement (EAR), the tolerable upper intake level (UL), and the adequate intake (AI). The RDA remains the dietary intake that is sufficient to meet the nutritional requirements of nearly all individuals in an ageand gender-specific group. RDAs are intended as goals for individuals. The EAR is the intake value that is estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of individuals in an ageand gender-specific group. The UL is the maximum level of daily nutrient intake that is unlikely to pose health risks to most individuals. The AI is determined when insufficient data are available to establish the EAR and RDA for a given nutrient. It is based on fewer data and more expert opinion but is also intended as goals for individuals.", "Tinpan McGurk 16 Posted December 14, 2018 Spouse will be having major surgery just after Xmas so am having to sell off most if not all of my CASS stuff: This one is my 92 Rossi...

The cup stands on a short stem on the bottom, and attached at the sides are two handles. The particular kylix that we are looking at is decorated on the sides and on the inside of the bowl with images of reclining drinkers. Kylices were associated with symposia: occasions where male Greek citizens gathered to drink and be social. The figure in the bowl is playing a favorite game of the symposium, kottabos, in which one flings wine from one\u2019s cup at another person. In ancient Greece, wine and drinking were viewed as evidence of humanity\u2019s capacity for rationality and empathy, as well as for self-destruction. Leon Kass, in his book The Hungry Soul, argues that wine has the capacity to relieve stress and facilitate positive relationships with others, but at the same time brings our latent animalistic tendencies to the surface. The Greeks seem to understand this, as evidenced by the characters in Plato\u2019s symposium. The characters of the play all gather to drink together and bond over the shared enjoyment of wine, yet the wisest of them, Socrates, does not get drunk. Conversely, the drunkest character of the story, Alciabades, makes a fool of himself. The construction and imagery of this kylix displays a friendly attitude towards wine in Greek culture, while the Symposium suggests that the Greeks were aware of the hidden dangers of drinking.", "tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4498027437395399225.post3776794170486269647..comments2017-01-12T08:46:36.158-08:00Comments on First Grade Fanatics: We're all about treasures around hereErin Scott so much for the ideas using the Treasure Se...Thanks so much for the ideas using the Treasure Series.

There are lots of aspects in the field of criminology. These aspects include the areas of research involved, the criminology schools of thought, theoretical developments and the people involved with creating and developing the theories. What role do criminologists play within the field of criminology? The term criminologist is used to describe any individual who's employed in the criminal justice field regardless of formal training. (Schmalleger) These individuals study crime, criminals, and criminal behavior. Those responsible for collecting and examining physical evidence of crime are known as criminalists. Criminologists perform various activities such as data gathering, data analysis, theory construction, hypothesis testing, social policy creation, public advocacy and public company, analysis of crime patterns and trends, education and training, and threat assessment and risk analysis. Criminology is categorized into three schools of thought: Classical, Positivist, and Chicago. These three schools fit into three different theoretical developments in criminology. However, there are six categories that fit into the theoretical developments. The first development is the Classical School which is composed of classical and neoclassical criminology. The classical school of criminological thought developed as a result of the Enlightenment or Age of Reason, a highly significant social movement in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The Enlightenments encouraged people to think for themselves rather obeying orders given by the State or Church.

In this regard, Russell Poldrock , PhD, U of Calif, in L.A., writing in the Proceedings of the national Academy of Science, Vol 103, No 31, writes that declarative memory, related to higher reasoning ability, is used when people focus on a single task, while the hippocampus, which has more to do with rote memory, is used when people multitask. Also see, Jeffrey Baumgartner, Don\u2019t Multi-task; Multi-think! 31-8-2006, and, by a team of researchers for the American Psychology Association, Executive control of Cognitive Process in Task Switching .\nIn other words, intensity and focus may not only be necessary to optimize human functioning on specific difficult and rigorous tasks; the habit of clear focused thinking may be necessary to keep one\u2019s mind in its best possible condition.\nWhat this may mean for employers is that if you can relieve your employees of menial, low level tasks, and especially those tasks which interrupt more difficult or significant tasks, then not only will your company benefit in the short run by automating tasks for which you would otherwise have had to expend staff time, you may also reap a significant benefit in more focused, sharper and more aware employees in the longer term.", "Where Is The Love????IF I AM GOING TO FALL IN LOVE I HOPE I CANNOT HURT AGAIN.. but i know everyone is going to hurt u., you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for...\u201d .. you just got to be willing .

This and other subtle changes have been introduced during the mid-life restyling of the model, which will be presented to the public at the imminent Los Angeles Auto Show (November 18-27) and will then become available at VW\u2019s showrooms in early 2012. The new model is easily recognizable thanks to its new front bumper, new grille and stretched-out fog-lights.\nTail lamps as well have been revised with the addition of LED lights, while the rear bumper is also different as both exhausts ends are placed on the left side (as opposed to the one-for-each-side solution of the current model). The standard equipment of the revamped Passat CC now includes bi-xenon headlights, static cornering lights, LED running lamps, fatigue detection device and RCD 310 audio system. The optional extras list instead features Side Assist Plus system with integrated Lane Assist (warns of vehicles in blind spots and assists the driver in avoiding accidents by steering intervention) and Dynamic Light Assist (automatic main beam control).\nThe engine range for the restyled Passat is made of the 1.8 TSI (160 hp), 2.0 TSI (210 hp) and V6 3.6 FSI (300 hp) petrol engines and the 2.0 TDI diesel unit, which will be come in two different configurations (140 and 170 hp). The cars equipped with the latter will have the start/stop system and also a battery for the recovery of braking energy. The passenger compartment will basically remain the same.", "Redtube College Teen Dance Party \u2013 that\u2019s the name of the hot, no the hottest party in town. For those who are unaware its an annual dance event of the Virginia college. It attracts teens from all over the city irrespective of their race. For the past few years majority consists of American and European teens; Asian and Russian teens also have a significant attendance. Not only teens teachers and lecturers from all the universities and colleges make sure to attend this party as it is one of the biggest events of the year. The special attraction for 2010 edition is the performance of the Las Vegas bad girls dance group, who will be performing on the hit numbers of Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Michael Jackson and Eminem. Even their videos were recorded which were later available for download on internet. For the enjoyment of the visitors a casino and a bar has also been set up in the hotel lobby area which is fully & easily accessible to all. The best part is that the guest list is moderated so that the male female ratio in the party remains almost 1:1. The exorbitant amount that they charge as cover is fully redeemable in the form of drinks. No wonder that every teen who enters this party walks out drunk. Because of heavydrinking the security requirement is top class as last year a drunk teen couple had created a lot of chaos, so everywhere there are CCTV cameras installed to ensure top security. Two hidden cams are also installed to ensure full security cover.

Secondly, criminals came, raped my wife during the time I was still the MEC.\" - JZ (not the rapper)I recently read an article with the latest story you tried to weave into an excuse as to why you had to splurge R250M odd of TAXPAYERS hard earned cash in order to validate the above comment.Seeing as you are paid by tax, which makes ME as a taxPAYER one of YOUR EMPLOYERS, I would like to know if I too can upgrade my home by adding unnecessary items such as a \" Firepool \", kraal, chicken run, etc. for the benefit of my family in order to protect any harm from coming to them. The good Lord only knows how a Firepool will protect my daughter and wife from being assaulted in our home (maybe we can train the cattle in the kraal and chickens in the coop in the arts of ninjitsu), but I'm sure that as it will all be at the cost of all South African Taxpayers, they won't mind if I submit these claims as tax deductible expenditures in the coming financial year? Also, I'm rather certain that SARS won't mind if all the taxpayers in this country do the same as at least it will keep those that actually do real work and contribute toward the economy, safe in their beds at night so that they can put in the hours the next day to keep the lights on.Sincerely yoursMike.", "by JW Summerisle\nI found out recently that a road I walk down every day is where my town\u2019s workhouse used to be, and thinking about my own poverty, my estrangement from both parents, and a trip I once took to the Foundling Museum in London (where I spent most of the visit lying on an little orphan\u2019s bed in a cold room) I started to paint a portrait that is myself and not myself. I\u2019m really interested in the weight of stories & warmth of colour. The figure rests on a pillow that is inverted, so it\u2019s still a pillow, but it\u2019s also a weight or a tombstone, something wedging the blood-tinted & hollowed face into the spiked, furred, ambiguous, abstract shapes of darkness & absence creeping in at the undefined edges of the body. The \u201cSaint Edmund\u201d of the title is a dark ages saint, about whom not much is known, beyond his (ineffectual, poor) kingship ended by Viking conquest. His rule was unmourned and unmissed until, at a later date, a monk on another continent spun a myth about Saint Edmund\u2019s severed head being hidden & discovered under the auspices of a wolf. I can\u2019t explain too well how much the odd story of this saint means to me, in terms of myth making, rebirth, transformation, delusion, fantasy and altered fact. In short, the painting is of my own head as that of Saint Edmund wreathed around in his bloodied cloak (or in a pool of rivulets and runs of blood), lying alone in the dark in the oppressive weight & ward of a workhouse bedroom.", "Hunger is something that may be constantly on our minds. We always seem to be concerned with what, where, and when we are (or will) be eating. But you might be surprised to know the psychological side of hunger. Hunger, along with the body\u2019s notification for needing food, is also a motivated state of mind. We often anticipate meals and feelings of hunger, and therefore at those times of day, we actually do feel hungry. Think back to the last time you missed a meal. At first chances are we were feeling ravenous at first. As the meal-time passed us by, and our minds wonder from the thought of food, we being to feel less hungry. That is not to say we should be skipping all our meals, but it is an interesting thing to keep in mind throughout the day as we are eating. Especially because one study found that most of the calories we eat come through snacks between meals, even though most people deny the amount of snacking they are doing!\nIt is also important that we are not depriving our bodies of its much-needed nutrition. When we do not eat enough, or enough of the right things (fruits and vegetables, protein, and even fat) our bodies are going to tell us they are hungry so they can get the nutrient they need. This article explains the hunger mood and how it influences the way we eat. If you are interested in learning more about nutrition and a healthy diet, please consider consulting with a dietician. Life Roots offers dietician services and counselling services (with a body positive approach) so we can better help you build a happy and healthy relationship with food!", "The Read | Behind the Business WIN $500 in Custom Shoes in Our Stampede-Inspired Pinterest Contest with ATB & Ania B. July 09, 2014 1-minute read We're midway through the Calgary Stampede and that means there's only a few days left to enter our Pinterest contest with ATB and Ania B.! To celebrate the launch of our Limited Edition Collection 02, we're giving away $500 in custom shoes! When we began making our leather selections for this collection in January, we had summertime in mind. It's filled with music festivals, parades and outdoor parties all over the world. In Alberta, the western influence is undeniable. So, with the Stampede top of mind, we chose a denim-inspired leather and named it \"Blue Jean Baby\"; we made it in a heeled ankle boot and a smoking slipper. For our light brown faggio leather, we went with the name \"Rodeo Darling\" and it formed the basis of our FIRST block heel boot (The Promenade and Runway Boot both have a stiletto heel). For our #ATBxPBFashionRoundup Pinterest contest, we wanted to see how the modern woman would style her Blue Jean Baby and Rodeo Darling boots and shoes, and asked you to start calling on your inner cowgirl and create a fashion board with your favourite styles from the new collection. So far, more than 50 boards have been created. We'll be selecting the winner the day after the contest closes (Tuesday, July 15th) - so GET GOING!

It's cool to have recent alumni from my school, not traditionally known for producing big creative types in the entertainment industry (though we are responsible for Mitch Hurwitz and, indirectly, Arrested Development\u2014you're welcome).\nI also happen to be in the lucky position of going to Georgetown while these young filmmakers are gaining ground. Two years ago, I got to attend an advance screening of \"Sound of My Voice\" followed by a Q&A with Marling, Batmanglij, and classmate Mike Cahill. Not only have I gotten to hear them speak very personally and openly about their experiences making short films at Georgetown and how they ended up on the path to Sundance stardom (Zal's journey was a pretty straightforward case of going to film school to improve his directing chops and making progressively larger-scale films with regularity since graduating Georgetown; Brit on the other hand, after graduating as valedictorian of her class, bowed out of a lucrative position at Goldman-Sachs to pursue acting and screenwriting), but I've also been able to connect with them as recent graduates of this school. I know the professors they had in their screenwriting classes, I currently run the television studio/film club that Brit Marling used to preside over, etc etc. I've gotten invested in these kids' careers as filmmakers, and I'm pulling for them to succeed and make it big\u2014without sacrificing their Georgetown-education-grounded convictions...more on that later.\nAll that being said, they've still got a long ways to go.", "%A Gaber, Mohamed %A Elsobky, Doaa %T Prevalence of female frigidity %9 Original Article %D 2021 %J Menoufia Medical Journal %R 10.4103/mmj.mmj_247_19 %P 76-80 %V 34 %N 1 %U  %8 January 1, 2021 %X Objectives To determine the prevalence of female frigidity among Egyptian females. Background Female frigidity or lack of sexual desire is the most prevalent sexual dysfunction in women across all ages. It was previously referred to as hypoactive sexual desire disorder and recently as female sexual interest and arousal disorder. Women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder may report little or no interest in sex, an inability to respond to sexual stimuli, or feeling numbness despite having a good relationship with her partner. Patients and methods This cross-sectional study was carried out in the period between June 2018 and July 2019. It was done at many sites providing services for women mainly in Alexandria and Menoufia, and also a web-based form was shared on social media groups and pages for women from Egypt. The patients were selected randomly. The study used the female sexual function index, and an Arabic translation was done with the questionnaire, and a section was added to collect data about the demographic characteristics of the participant. Results The study statistically showed that the prevalence of female frigidity among the study participants was 69.5%, the prevalence of female sexual dysfunction among the study group was 65.5%, and the prevailing sexual disorder among the study group was low sexual desire. Conclusion In this study, hypoactive sexual desire disorder was reported in 69.5% of women. There was a significant correlation between female sexual dysfunction and age, residency, and the duration of marriage. %0 Journal Article %I Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications %@ 1110-2098", "President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda at the London Summit on Family Planning in 2012 \u2022 bit.ly/2hvBAxiUgandans Debate Constitution September 25, 2017 News Christian leaders have been drawn into a debate about whether Uganda\u2019s constitution should be changed to clear the way for President Yoweri Museveni to stand for another term in office. Museveni has been the country\u2019s president since 1986. The Ugandan constitution requires that the president be in the age range of 35 to 75. Museveni, age 73, will be ineligible to stand in the next election, scheduled for 2121. Moves are afoot to change the constitution, and this is causing division between clergy and bishops joining the debate. Archbishop John Baptist Odama, president of the Catholic Bishops Conference, is unequivocal: \u201cThose who are planning to change the constitution are ruining the peace of Ugandans when we want a peaceful transition of power.\u201d Two Anglican bishops have opposed the constitutional change. \u201cI do not support removal of the age limit,\u201d said the Rt. Rev. Dan Zoreka, Bishop of Kinkizi. \u201cWe have been waiting to see President Museveni hand over power peacefully. Changing the constitution is not good for the stability and peace of Uganda.\u201d The Rt. Rev. Reuben Kisembo, Bishop of Ruwenzori, said that lifting age limits would be synonymous with locking out other potential leaders. He argued that Uganda has many qualified people who could be president, and therefore there was no pressing need to change the constitution.

It applies the critical theory approaches of thinkers such as Franz Neumann, Theodor W. Adorno and Erich Fromm. It analyses changes of US capitalism that have together with political anxiety and demagoguery brought about the rise of Donald Trump. This article draws attention to the importance of state theory for understanding Trump and the changes of politics that his rule may bring about. It is in this context important to see the complexity of the state, including the dynamic relationship between the state and the economy, the state and citizens, intra-state relations, inter-state relations, semiotic representations of and by the state, and ideology. Trumpism and its potential impacts are theorised along these dimensions. The ideology of Trump (Trumpology) has played an important role not just in his business and brand strategies, but also in his political rise. The (pseudo-)critical mainstream media have helped making Trump and Trumpology by providing platforms for populist spectacles that sell as news and attract audiences. By Trump making news in the media, the media make Trump. An empirical analysis of Trump\u2019s rhetoric and the elimination discourses in his NBC show The Apprentice underpins the analysis of Trumpology. The combination of Trump\u2019s actual power and Trump as spectacle, showman and brand makes his government\u2019s concrete policies fairly unpredictable. An important question that arises is what social scientists\u2019 role should be in the conjuncture that the world is experiencing..", "Occidental Petroleum\u2019s (NYSE: OXY) finances have benefited from high benchmark prices in recent months. In Q2, the company reported $2.7 billion of operating cash flow before working capital changes which assisted $3 billion of debt retirement in July. Considering EIA\u2019s average WTI benchmark price projection of $65.93/bbl for 2021, operating cash flows are likely to assist debt retirals apart from asset divestments in the near term. Per recent filings, the company remains committed to deleverage the balance sheet and create long-term value for shareholders. Thus, the stock can observe an upside as debt retirements happen in the near term. Our interactive dashboard analysis highlights Occidental Petroleum\u2019s stock performance during the current crisis with that during the 2008 recession. 100% from the lows seen on Mar 23, as the Fed\u2019s multi-billion dollar stimulus package suppresses near-term survival anxiety and infuses liquidity into the system. are a drag on shareholder returns. Anadarko\u2019s acquisition increased OXY\u2019s balance sheet with $28 billion of long-term debt in 2019. Thus, the annual interest expenditure of more than $1 billion is a drag on shareholder returns. However, the recent uptick in benchmark prices has been a boon for the company as operating cash flows are assisting debt retirements. Notably, the company reported $64.18/bbl of realized crude oil price in Q2 2021 \u2013 fairly comparable to the WTI benchmark projection by EIA for 2021.\nThe company plans to maintain a prudent capital investment plan along with divestitures to provide long-term shareholder returns. Considering the WTI benchmark price projection by EIA for 2021 and Occidental\u2019s strong operating cash generation capabilities, Trefis believes that investors can observe near-term gains as debt retirements occur.\nIs Exxon Mobil a better pick over Occidental Petroleum?", "How a Lone, Violence-Weary Snitch Felled Mexico Boss Inside the capture of Teodoro 'El Teo' Garcia Simental By Evann Gastaldo, Newser Staff Posted Jul 22, 2013 9:03 AM CDT STORY COMMENTS (12)  the violence. The informant met with DEA agents in Mexico City, far from Garcia's home turf in Tijuana. Yes, he wanted to be paid for his information\u2014but he also wanted to help \"clean up my country,\" he told agents as he handed over Garcia's phone number. Agents were quickly able to nab Garcia in a predawn raid that caught him off guard, wearing his \"tighty whities,\" according to one agent, as balloons from his daughter's birthday party the day prior still floated around the Cabo San Lucas residence. \"There were 100 guys preparing for the worst and, turns out, it was just a guy in his underwear,\" another agent recalled. Garcia's arrest soon slashed the once-overwhelming violence in Baja California, returning it to its former status as a tourist destination, though the Sinaloa drug cartel is believed to now have a hold there. As for the informant, \"He's still alive, living happily, in that general area,\" says an agent.

DOI:10.1088/0031-9155/45/4/319\nNon-invasive treatment of brain disorders using ultrasound would require a transducer array that can propagate ultrasound through the skull and still produce sufficient acoustic pressure at a specific location within the brain. Additionally, the array must not cause excessive heating near the skull or in other regions of the brain. A hemisphere-shaped transducer is proposed which disperses the ultrasound over a large region of the skull. The large surface area covered allows maximum ultrasound gain while minimizing undesired heating. To test the feasibility of the transducer two virtual arrays are simulated by superposition of multiple measurements from an 11-element and a 40-element spherically concave test array. Each array is focused through an ex vivo human skull at four separate locations around the skull surface. The resultant ultrasound field is calculated by combining measurements taken with a polyvinylidene difluoride needle hydrophone providing the fields from a 44-element and a 160-element virtual array covering 88% and 33% of a hemisphere respectively. Measurements are repeated after the phase of each array element is adjusted to maximize the constructive interference at the transducer's geometric focus. An investigation of mechanical and electronic beam steering through the skull is also performed with the 160-element virtual array, phasing it such that the focus of the transducer is located 14 mm from the geometric centre. Results indicate the feasibility of focusing and beam steering through the skull using an array spread over a large surface area. Further, it is demonstrated that beam steering through the skull is plausible..", "Essays in english websites college com custom editor sites for irish.

What remained, along with the tragic injuries and lives lost, was a remarkable array of conflicting interpretations and theories about what happened-and why.Above the Shots sheds new light on this historic event through the recollections of more than 50 narrators, whose stories are unique and riveting: the former mayor of Kent a witness to the riot in town a few nights earlier a protester who helped burn the ROTC building a Black United Students member who was warned to stay away from the protest a Vietnam veteran who deplored the counterculture yet administered first aid to the wounded a friend of one of the mortally wounded students, who died in his arms a guardsman sympathetic to the students a faculty member supportive of the Guard an outraged student who went to the state capital to make a citizen's arrest of Governor Rhodes a pair of former KSU presidents who, years later, courted controversy by how they chose to memorialize the tragedy. From the precipitous cultural conflicts of the 1960s to the everraging battle over how to remember the Kent State incident, the authors examine how these accounts challenge and deepen our understanding of the shootings, the Vietnam Era, memory, and oral history. Spanning five decades, Above the Shots not only chronicles the immediate chain of events that led to the shootings but explores causes and consequences, prevailing conspiracies, and the search for catharsis. It is a narrative assemblage of voices that rise above the rhetoric-above the din-to show how a watershed moment in modern American history continues to speak to us.", "The Best Wedding Locations, Venues And Sites In Fort Collins\nDon't tell everyone the secret but Fort Collins, Colorado is pretty close to paradise.

The purpose of this masters thesis was to describe the management of information within a local unit of Bor\u00e5s municipality by putting an information audit-method in practice. The focus was on three issues: What information needs could be seen in the organization? How does the information flow through the organization? How does Sugan Henczels seven-stage model serve as a tool to map the management of information within the local unit? The study only described the situation at a certain time at the chosen organization. The seven-stage information audit model was revised and adjusted to the studied organization by only carrying out four of the seven steps: Planning, Data collection, Data analysis and Data evaluation. A total of seven semi-structured interviews were conducted. The respondents answers from the interviews were analysed and evaluated and the findings were presented and discussed. Their information needs were mainly focused on the elderly patients and nearly everybody thought the information was easy to find. Change in the strategic level in the organization and the experienced employees were considered to be the main factors for the satisfactory management of information. The flow of information through the different levels in the organization was regarded as sufficient, but could be optimised by a few adjustments. Henczels model for the information audit was considered a necessary instrument to conduct this study. The method provided structure to the study and guided me in the right directions.", "My daughter, Olivia, has stolen my heart.

Babur boasted an impressive lineage, being a direct descendant of both Genghis Kahn and Timur. At age eleven, he became the ruler of his homeland in present day Uzbekastan. Immediately upon his ascension, he had to contend with members of his extended family who sought to depose him. During the first decade of his rule, he lost most of his kingdom to rivals. However, Babur persevered and captured new territory and temporarily retook his ancestral lands. However, he remained under the threat of the Uzbeks who kept taking his territories from him. Consequently, Babur looked south to India as a place of conquest where he could be rid of his longtime enemies.\nAfter a series of battles, Babur defeated Punjabi forces and killed their leader. He took control of Agra and Delhi in April of 1526 and placed himself as the head of the new Mughal Dynasty. Although Babur only reigned his new empire for four years, from 1526 through 1530, he accomplished much. Because he was a descendant of Timur and educated in the Persian tradition, Babur's new empire was full of Persian influence. This left an indelible mark on India that exists to this day. India became full of signs of Persian and Islamic influence, such as in the arts and philosophy. Although the religion had been practiced to a certain degree in India for centuries, under the Mughals, Islam spread thoroughly throughout northern and central India, influencing culture and society in countless ways.", "Our Loan Officer knew exactly how to meet our needs.

Earlier this year I was in Rochester and, after visiting the Cathedral, where once John Fisher was Bishop, I glanced over to the old Bishop's House on the north side of the Cathedral. The house, now no longer the Bishop's Palace, and almost certainly altered since Tudor times, is nonetheless the house in which John Fisher lived when he was Rochester's Bishop.\nThe house is still small and would have been a humble Bishop's house, by medieval and renaissance standards. But within its walls there remains those spaces which nurtured the blossoming of an apostolic courage which would establish the Church in this country on new and certain footings, even if they departed from contemporary expectations. Here, and in the old house in Chelsea (Thomas More's home), were forged the beginnings of recusancy - the desire to conform always to the person of Christ, together with the desire never to conform to the prevailing culture. These two men stood out in a singular way from all their contemporaries, but many would follow them - those for whom the term 'recusant' would be applied. In our country we have no greater models and leaders than our recusant forbears, because they show us how to be recusants today. They appeal to our deepest sensibilities, the relationship that we have with Christ the Lord, and to forge in our own homes and places of work those same desires. How the Lord will use these desires of ours is His to name.", "The Photographic Portrait Prize is seen as the photographic sibling of the BP Portrait Award, and is annual exhibition of work submitted for the competition by photographers from all over the world.60 portraits are included in the exhibition from nearly 7,000 submissions from over 2,500 photographers, making the 2007 Photographic Portrait Prize the largest it has ever been.

I'm was just installing a stable 2008.9 image. The only changes made is that a terminal is installed and the /etc/opkg/* is changed to pointing to the testing repository instead. Then, from the local terminal, I run opkg update and then opkg upgrade. The upgrade is working for some good 20-30 minutes downloading and installing new packages until X is shut down. Apparently opkg wanted to restart X or something? Then I figure I'll do it over ssh instead, so I log in and run 'opkg upgrade' again. To my surprise I see that it starts all over again, downloading and \"installing\" (?) the same packages over again. Didn't the previous upgrade just do that? Are the \"downloaded\" and \"installed\" files stored in a temporary directory in the meantime? I checked the used disk-space and found it to be only 81-82 MB. Didn't check how much was used before the first run though. Or does the opkg wait with updating its database of installed packages until the complete upgrade has finished? Which means I by now actually have the latest and greatest, just opkg doesn't know it is? Anyway, the upgrade via ssh failed miserably as well. Of course dropbear had to be restarted, I lost connection and opkg was interrupted (again). Next try is screen, which is currently running, downloading and installing the exact same packages done by the previous two upgrades. Is there some way to make opkg \"continue where interrupted\" or some way of specifying I don't want a certain service restarted (like dropbear) ? -Ivar Mossin -------------- next part -------------- An HTML attachment was scrubbed...

The Jennings Brothers began their metalwork foundry in Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1891 and remained open until the early 1950s. Jennings Brothers produced some of the most finely crafted art metal pieces that exist to this day. Their product line ranged from bookends to candlesticks to animal figurines, etc. Their methods of production required meticulous techniques which did not lend themselves to machine-directed mass production, but rather depended upon the handiwork of expert artists, sculptors and metal craftsman. Jennings Brothers metalwork is highly prized and their distinctive \"JB\" mark, which marked all of their products, is highly sought after by collectors world-wide. Jennings employed many new immigrants to the U.S. and their designs had an international flair. There is no other major metalwork foundry from this era with finishes as durable as Jennings Bros. and the complexity of their designs is highly prized. This is an exceptional example of their work. It is a Victorian inkwell in the shape of an English Pug dog. This whimsical piece is a pug with glass eyes. His head is hinged and tips back to reveal the inkwell with the original glass insert in perfect condition. He has a beautiful bronze patina over a base metal and is signed and numbered on the bottom, J.B. 683. One glass eye has an age line and the bronze finish shows normal wear for the age of the piece, please refer to photos. It measures 3 5/8 inches to the top of the ear and 5 \u00bd inches deep by 5 \u00bc inches at the widest point and weighs 2 lbs.

According to Fred Dunnington, Middlebury's Planning and Zoning officer, the town has permitted 500 units during the last two years. This is up astronomically from previous years which normally saw only 20 or so. All permits do not necessarily result in projects, but a significant number are currently underway. Dunnington said that these projects are a result of a few specific market forces. There is an increased interest in living in town, sometimes because folks are tired of commuting to Middlebury jobs, sometimes because of an increased interest in being able to walk to destinations for economic or health reasons. Another factor driving the market is the number of older residents interested in communities or complexes that can provide assisted living and other amenities needed in an aging population.

Then came the battery. So that we can walk around with this mobile kitchen appliance.\nThe first types of batteries were nickel batteries, dry batteries, accumulators and so on. With the progress of science and technology, the development of society, battery is not willing to lag behind, conform to the development of The Times. The appearance of lithium battery promotes the development of information technology. Believe it or not, demand for lithium-ion batteries has more than doubled since 2015. The reason for such an increase in the demand for lithium-ion batteries is the emergence of products from the electronics industry. It is because of lithium-ion batteries that we can work and play with our smartphones, ipads and laptops without any worries.\nFrom 2019 to 2029, ion batteries are expected to grow about ninefold, according to the data. And the industry's costs will continue to fall. Therefore, the future development path of lithium ion battery is very bright. Over the past decade, battery prices have plummeted by about 87 percent, and the calcium carbide industry is booming. I think the battery industry should keep up with the development of the information industry and let the development of information technology drive the battery industry and the battery industry promote the development of information technology.

They were bred as vermin-controlling hunting dogs by aboriginal peoples in Malaysia known as the Orang Asli. The tribe built their houses in stilts so as to stay away from dangerous animals on the ground and so the Telomian developed a unique climbing ability. The breed is related to the dingo and the New Guinea Singing Dog and some cynologists claim that the Telomian could be the \u201cmissing link\u201d between the African Basenji and the Australian Dingo. A small to medium-sized breed, it stands at an average height of 15 to 18 inches and weigh from 18 to 28 pounds. It has a slightly domed skull with a wedge-shaped head. Its ears are triangular shaped and carried erect. It has an elongated back and its tail is carried natural with a slight curve. Like the Chow chow, it has a blue-black tongue. The coat is short and smooth and comes in various shades of sable with white ticking. It can also appear in parti-coloured black and white, fawn and white, or black and tan with large colour patches.\nThe Telomian is said to be extremely intelligent and an avid hunter. A distinct characteristic of the breed is its ability to used its paws to hold objects and open doors the same way humans do. They are instinctively alert and they make a strange musical howling sound similar to that of the Basenji or the New Guinea Singing Dog. Early socialization and training is important so that the breed can adjust to people and to new situations.\nblog comments powered by Disqus", "There needs to be more concrete solutions in order to keep and grow jobs in America. Indiana has a long manufacturing history that needs to thrive in the modern day. I want to propose subsidies for manufacturing robots in order to help keep and expand these manufacturing jobs in Indiana. This will create high skilled jobs when people work with these robots, and also help to keep these jobs from going to other countries with worse working conditions and less human rights. More manufacturing jobs here will help America to change its current trade deficit.\nThe federal corporate tax rate in America is too high. I will propose that the corporate tax rate be brought down to 15% for all brackets. 15% is currently the lowest percentage for the lowest bracket only. More resources need to be put towards ensuring that corporations are paying their fair share of tax, and collecting on this tax is an important role of the state to keep other functions running, such as building infrastructure and repaying the nation\u2019s debt. This includes closing the loopholes which allow corporations to not pay their fair share of tax. This lower federal corporate tax rate will also allow states more freedom in regards to their corporate tax codes. At the same time taxes on people making above $1,000,000 in a year should be in their own tax bracket. This will encourage businesses to keep the money in their businesses for growth instead of in the hands of a few people in the company.", "Glue The Paper To The Square Frame, And Fold In The Extra Edges Leaving One Edge On Each Frame , And Glue Them.\nTaking your time selecting the parts of the lathe will help a great deal as you will want to monitor your child when he/she is working on the woodworking project.

Her main characteristics are; She is easy growing and produces high yields of big buds with strong, long lasting high. This marijuana represents an indica/sativa family and possesses the best qualities of the both strains which made her a winner of 2005 and 2006 Cannabis Cup. Growing Master Kush cannabis seeds are very easy. They are not suitable for outdoor growing, unless you live in a very warm country with a stable climate, but show excellent performance when cultivated indoors and respond well to any growing methods. Their strong genotype helps them resist mild stress as well as mould and mushroom. We would definitely recommend this cannabis for beginners. Indica dominant, seeds of Master Kush marijuana produce middle sized plants which grow a bit bushy developing a typical christmas tree shape. They show very little stretch, ending up at about 16 inches. This pot seed variety is not pungent so smell is not a problem - even if you don\u2019t have a proper ventilation system. Master Kush cannabis is very eye appealing; her buds are heavily frosted with trichomes, multiple colas (some LST done early in vegetation) with a large number of big buds and many smaller jawbreaker sized popcorn buds.. This baby is really a good yielder, she produces up to 500 gr. of quality marijuana per m2.

Among the allegations in the 100 page complaint are charges that:\nLegally, education of native American children is the responsibility of the federal government and not of the state in which they live or the tribe to which they belong.

URL: <>", "Abstract\nThe spatial structure of the raindrop size distribution (DSD) conveys crucial information for reliable quantitative estimation of rainfall using remote sensing techniques. To investigate this question, a network of 16 optical disdrometers has been deployed over a typical weather radar pixel (~1 \u00d7 1 km2) in Lausanne, Switzerland. A set of 36 rainfall events has been classified according to three types: convective, transitional, and frontal. In a first step, the spatial structure of the DSD is quantified using spatial correlation for comparison with the literature, showing good agreement with previous studies. The spatial structure of important quantities related to the DSD\u2014namely, the total concentration of drops Nt, the mass-weighted diameter Dm, and the rain rate R\u2014is quantified using variograms. Results clearly highlight that DSD fields are organized and not randomly distributed even at a scale below 1 km. Moreover, convective-type rainfall exhibits larger variability of the DSD than do transitional and frontal rainfall. The temporal resolution is shown to have an influence on the results: increasing time steps tend to decrease the spatial variability. This study presents a possible application of such information by quantifying the error associated with the use of point measurements as areal estimates at larger scales. Analyses have been conducted for different sizes of domain ranging from 100 \u00d7 100 to 1000 \u00d7 1000 m2. As expected, this error is increasing with the size of the domain. For instance, for a domain of ~1000 \u00d7 1000 m2, the error associated with rain-rate estimates is on the order of 25% for all types of rain.", "Mailing List:2002-01-16 02, Re: Unidentified subject!, by Robert L.

As reported in AsianInvestor, the bank is moving away from onboarding small start-up hedge funds, instead looking to follow its European model in Hong Kong by targeting heavyweight hedge funds and premium start-ups. And this raft of new additions would seem to suggest they\u2019re well on track. Avijit Choudhury joins from Bloomberg as a director on the systems desk, along with Henri Arslanian as Associate Director, Structuring and Regulation. Ben Horner, who only joined UBS from Cranmore Capital last month, has been promoted to Head of Business Consulting, Asia. All three will report to Ashley Jarvis, Global Head of Capital Consulting. On the capital introduction side, Cheryl Lau joins from Hillhouse Capital, with an additional investor-relations executive due to start next month. David Forsyth, meanwhile, joins its sales desk.

That would be exactly the kind of coverage that they\u2019re meant to follow. So\u2026 either the Sun got it wrong \u2013 which is my preference \u2013 or the studio does not want anyone talking about it and is hoping people will forget, because production has resumed and Tom Cruise continues to shoot. Here he is working on a scene with Rebecca Ferguson and also on a scene that requires him to run.\nWell\u2026 that\u2019s comforting?\nTom Cruise will run, always run, no matter what else is going on, whatever movie he happens to be in, he\u2019ll do the running, he\u2019ll run a lot, he\u2019ll run hard. It\u2019s the like the sun rising and setting. And the same goes for Tom Cruise filming. Nothing can stop him. Sometimes it seems like making movies is all he knows. It\u2019s when he\u2019s truly at peace \u2013 when he\u2019s running he\u2019s at peace, when he\u2019s jumping from or off something he\u2019s at peace.

The Kerns had not signed and do not want drilling under their land. Their neighbors do. Ohio has a law on the books that allows for \u201cforced pooling\u201d in cases when a majority of the surrounding land is leased but landowners with small positions refuse to sign. The Kerns resisted and fought the case all the way to Ohio Supreme Court, which rejected their claims. Chesapeake drilled and fracked three wells (on a neighboring property), which included drilling under the Kerns\u2019 property. So the Kerns filed a new lawsuit in 2016, in federal court, claiming a \u201ctaking\u201d of their property had occurred. The federal court has just ruled\u2013against the Kerns. This was the first time a court case dealt directly with the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s unitization (forced pooling) law. The upshot: Ohio\u2019s forced pooling law remains intact and in force\u2026 Please Login to view this content. (Not a member? Join Today!)

The word \"Credenza\" is taken from the Italian Medieval Latin word \"credentia\" which referred to the buffet where food and drinks were placed before arriving at the main table. Servants would then officially taste the drinks and food to make sure they were not poisoned. If the servant was still standing, the feast would then make its way from the credenza to the dining room table.

I only had students who wanted a turn to sing a solo.\nWe are still working on learning how to track the beat. Before we begin I will read the target to them and then I will model what it looks like. We discuss how you go from left to right and when it's time to go to the next line, you start back on the left side.\nNext I go over how they will be getting their own beat chart. They need to find a spot on the floor. As they say the poem \"Bee Bee Bumblebee\" they need to tap the beehives. They will say the poem without me. As they say the poem and tap the beat I walk around the room helping those who are not able to track the beat. Then I had them turn their beat charts in. Next I had students go up to the board to show the class that they can track the beat. I called on students who I knew could do it. I wanted everyone to see what it looks like. I have students who really are struggle with this. I am not sure it's because they need more work on moving and feeling the beat (did a lot of this in Kindergarten) or is it because they struggle to read and they are trying to read the words as well.", "One of the best known luxury shoe brands Christian Louboutin will be opening at least two stores in China by the end of 2011. The French brand has plans of opening at least five stores in China over next three years and intends to expand business in India and Brazil too. This clearly indicates the shift in marketing strategy of luxury brands. They are now shifting focus to growing economies in Asia and South America where household incomes are rising and there is an increased trend of luxury spending. On the other hand luxury high end markets in America and Europe have been adversely affected by recession.\nOne just has to wait and see whether these high end exclusive luxury brands will have buyers in Asia. A pair of Christian Louboutin costs at least $2000 and it has Angelina Jolie and other Hollywood big names on its client list. More over people in China or India may not like high heeled shoes for which the brand is renowned. It has to create new styles and range of shoes for its clientele in Asia.\nIn competitive world, it is good news indeed that brands are now open to ideas of exploring new shores. Christian Louboutin first store in China will open in Beijing in July 2011 and next one will be Shanghai. High end luxury buyers in these places will not have to fly out to other countries in search of brands, brands will be coming to their nation to cater to their needs.", "Plekhanov, Georgi Valentinovich\nPlekhanov, Georgi Valentinovich g\u0101\u00f4r\u00b4g\u0113 v\u0259ly\u012dnty\u0113\u00b4n\u0259v\u012dch ply\u012dkh\u00e4\u00b4n\u0259f [key], 1857\u20131918, Russian revolutionary and social philosopher. He was a leader in introducing Marxist theory to Russia and is often called the\nFather of Russian Marxism.As a youth he joined the Populist organization Land and Freedom (see narodniki ), but he broke (1879) with it because of his opposition to political terror. He left Russia in 1880 as a political refugee and spent most of his exile in Geneva, Switzerland. Turning to Marxist socialism, he became one of the chief founders of the League for the Emancipation of Labor (1883), the nucleus of the Russian Social Democratic Labor party, and in 1900 with V. I. Lenin began to publish the Socialist newspaper Iskra [spark]. In his writings Plekhanov took the view that conditions in Russia would not be ripe for socialism until capitalism and industrialization had progressed sufficiently. This opinion was the basis of Menshevik thought after the split (1903) of the Social Democratic Labor party into Bolshevism and Menshevism . Although Plekhanov still supported Lenin at the fateful party congress of 1903, he thereafter generally opposed Bolshevism. From this time until the outbreak of World War I, he occupied a largely independent position and attempted to reunite the two factions. Plekhanov supported Russia's participation in the war. After the outbreak of the February Revolution of 1917, he returned from exile and concentrated on rousing support for continuing the war and fighting the growing influence of the Bolsheviks. Following the October Revolution of 1917 and the triumph of Lenin, he retired from public life. Among his translated works are Socialism and Anarchism (tr. 1895) and Fundamental Problems of Marxism (tr. 1929). +-", "To investigate the effects of moist olive husks (MOH-residues) on soil respiration, microbial biomass, and enzymatic (o-diphenoloxidase, beta-glucosidase, dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase) activities, a silty clay soil was incubated with 0 (control), 8 x 10(3) (D), 16 x 10(3) (2D) and 80 x 10(3) (10D) kg ha-1 of MOH-residues on a dry weight basis. Soil respiration and microbial biomass data indicated that the addition of MOH-residues strongly increased microbial activity proportionally to the amounts added. Data of qCO2 suggested that the respiration to biomass ratio of the microbial population was strongly modified by MOH-residues additions during the first 90 days of incubation. The qCO2 data suggested a low efficiency in energy yields from C oxidation during the first 2 months of soil incubation. qFDA seemed to be relatively unaffected for treatments D and 2D as compared to the control, but was significantly lowered by the application of 10D, showing the lowest hydrolytic activity of microbial biomass in this treatment up to 360 days of incubation. o-Diphenoloxidase activity was delayed, and this delay was extended with the addition of larger quantities of MOH-residues. Alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase and dehydrogenase activities were in line with the findings on microbial biomass changes and activities. The biological and biochemical data suggest that the addition of a large quantity of MOH-residues (80 x 10(3) kg ha-1) strongly modifies the soil characteristics affecting the r- and K-strategist populations, and that these changes last for at least the 360 days of incubation. The data also suggest that application rates exceeding 16 x 10(3) kg ha-1 are not recommended until the agro-chemical and -physical functions of the soil are further studied.", "Latest News Aston EyeTech Launches Eyoto, an Ophthalmic Measurement Tech Brand By Staff Thursday, January 25, 2018 12:15 AM BIRMINGHAM, U.K.\u2014Aston EyeTech, a U.K.-based developer and manufacturer of ophthalmic measurement technology, is launching Eyoto, a new brand centered around its upcoming next generation eye diagnostic and measurement solutions. The company\u2019s new lens inspection technology, which features the company\u2019s device engineering expertise with advanced intelligent software systems, will be showcased at Vision Expo in March. Aston EyeTech recently completed a $6.7 million Series A investment round.

The purpose of this study was to compare radiation dose and image quality of single- and dual-energy CT (SECT, DECT) examinations of the chest in matched cohorts for second and third-generation dual-source CT (DSCT) systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We analyzed 200 patients (100 men; mean age, 61.7 \u00b1 14.8 years old; 100 women, mean age, 59.4 \u00b1 15.1 years old), matched by sex and body mass index, who had undergone clinically indicated contrast-enhanced chest CT. Four study groups, each consisting of 50 patients, were evaluated. Contrast-enhanced chest CT was performed using vendor-preset second-generation DSCT (group A, 120-kV SECT; group C, 80/Sn140-kV DECT) or third-generation DSCT (group B, 90-kV SECT; group D, 90/Sn150-kV DECT) protocols. Radiation dose assessment was normalized to a scan range of 27.5 cm. Image quality was objectively analyzed using dose-independent figure-of-merit (FOM) contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) calculations and subjectively evaluated by three independent radiologists. RESULTS. Direct comparison of effective radiation dose for second-generation DSCT groups A and C showed statistically significant lower radiation dose values for DECT compared with SECT acquisition (3.2 \u00b1 1.2 mSv vs 2.3 \u00b1 0.6 mSv, p \u2264 0.004), but differences between third-generation SECT and DECT were not significant (1.2 \u00b1 0.9 mSv vs 1.3 \u00b1 0.6 mSv, p = 0.412). FOM CNR analysis revealed highest values for third-generation DECT (p \u2264 0.043). Differences in subjective image quality between the four groups were not statistically significant (p \u2265 0.179). CONCLUSION. Contrast-enhanced DECT examinations of the chest can be performed routinely with second- and third-generation DSCT systems without either increased radiation exposure or decreased image quality compared with SECT acquisition.\nI documenti in IRIS sono protetti da copyright e tutti i diritti sono riservati, salvo diversa indicazione.", "Matrix Kitchen & Dining Furniture\nTake a spin in modern luxury with this Stainless Steel Modern Round 5-piece Dining Set.

I am sure he is a nice guy and would not put him down in relation to his personality, but the boy did not belong in a singing competition that usually produces superstars.\nIt was kind of cool though to see Simon squirm because he did not know what to do when America wasn\u2019t listening to his advice and kept Sanjaya going. I laughed a couple of times over that. It is humorous to me to see Simon take a bunch of heat especially when he is usually right. I have to admit that I wonder a little bit as to how much of the fights between Ryan and Simon are staged for ratings. They get into it pretty good. Why is it that we enjoy seeing people belittle each other? Is it because we are just glad that it is not us that is being put down? Not sure. Could be.\nIt is an entertaining show that sucks America \u2013 including me \u2013 in to. It will be much easier to endure this next week knowing that Sanjaya will not be singing.

I could be wrong, >I haven't read the SCSI specs that much. > No, actually all hard disks have built in ECC. The code gets validated as the data is being read off the disk. The ECC is part of the data that gets put in between the sectors. Haven't you ever wondered why the formatted capacity of a disk is lower than the unformatted? This is part of the reason why - the inter-sector gap hold all sorts of information useful to the controller for peeling the data off the disk. Errors between the controller and disk can happen - for long busses like the SCSI one they have parity that you can enable. I don't believe the ESDI, IDE, ST506 drives/controllers have anything like this but their life is simpler because they are only designed for short hauls inside the same computer so the likelihood of errors occurring is much much smaller.

In contrast, the 3 to 5 per 1,000 who are homozygotes are at risk of developing severe and potentially lethal iron overload, with damage to a number of organs, including the liver, pancreas, heart, joints, and the endocrine glands. Although the removal of the excess iron by repeated venesections is simple, effective, and safe therapy, much of the organ damage, once it has occurred, is irreversible. Because symptoms are often nonspecific, it is important for physicians in the relevant specialties to develop a high index of suspicion and to apply widely the appropriate screening tests, including transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration. Equally important is the detection of affected family members, who are usually siblings, before they have developed significant iron overload. In addition, screening of populations in which the prevalence of hereditary hemochromatosis is high has become an attractive and cost-effective option, especially now that the molecular structure of the HFE gene has been defined. Using this approach it is now possible to detect individuals homozygous or heterozygous for the gene using a simple polymerase chain reaction-based test. The application of this exciting new tool promises to provide fresh insights into the range of phenotypic expression in hereditary hemochromatosis. A challenge for the future will be to define the genetic or environmental factors responsible for iron overload in up to 20% of patients with clinical hemochromatosis who do not have the HFE gene.", "I wrote a post on this blog back in 2009 that I need to change/clarify.

It came to signify much of my transformation and the direction I was headed. And while she is no longer my girlfriend, she is still extremely important to me. She is someone I know I can count on no matter what. She was there for me during a hugely strange and chaotic time in my life and was a major champion of my self-discovery. We enjoy each other and I look forward to having a front row seat to her accomplishments! She thinks it\u2019s somewhat silly to have nicknames for people on my blog, but I don\u2019t like using real names. And since the word Fleur de lis is more of a representation of my journey than a definition of who she is, I want to change her nickname. From now on, she will be called Chicory Root.

I guess I was prepared for this to be a lot harder then it has been so far. I would still say that Olivia was my hardest baby, not because she was a bad baby (Alexander is by far our most fussy and loud baby) but because it was such a huge adjustment to go from working full time to being home full time with a baby. I was never a baby person before having Olivia and honestly am still not a huge baby person, give me a six month old over a newborn any day!

However, the problem of predicting the motion of an object in the next few frames remains an unsolved and less explored problem. Given a sequence of frames, predicting the motion in the next few frames of the video becomes difficult in cases where the displacement of optical flow vector across frames is large. Traditional CNNs often fail to learn the dynamics of the objects across frames in case of large displacements of objects in consecutive frames. In this paper, we present an efficient CNN based on the concept of feature pyramid for extracting the spatial features from a few consecutive frames. The spatial features extracted from consecutive frames by a modified PWC-Net architecture are fed into a bidirectional LSTM for obtaining the temporal features. The proposed spatiotemporal feature pyramid is able to capture the abrupt motion of the moving objects in video, especially when displacement of the object is large across the consecutive frames. Further, the proposed spatiotemporal pyramidal feature can effectively predict the optical flow in next few frames, instead of predicting only the next frame. The proposed method of predicting optical flow outperforms the state of the art when applied on challenging datasets such as \u201cMPI Sintel Final Pass,\u201d \u201cMonkaa\u201d and \u201cFlying Chairs\u201d where abrupt and large displacement of the moving objects in consecutive frames is the main challenge.", "Bill Gates suggested that we can tax the robots to pay for a transition to a more service-based economy. It sounds to me like that might be a bad idea. The Economist talks about how taxing robots will probably slow the transition to a more automated future. That transition is a good thing and slowing it down is probably a bad idea. The Economist also notes that taxing robots does not address the problem of demand. If robots are capable of producing more than humans (and they are) then there needs to be some mechanism to create additional demand. Taxing the robot and redistributing that money doesn\u2019t create enough demand by itself. At best, it only partially offsets the exploitative potential of a company that can produce goods without paying people.\nHackernoon takes the position that the money should be taxed from the people who own robots. It\u2019s a more direct answer to the oblique reference in the economist. An automated company can exploit the market by charging people for something without paying workers. That company will generate obscene profits. Those profits go to the rich. So tax the rich, right?\nI suggest that both of these solutions (tax the rich or tax the robots) amount to the same thing and are both counterproductive. The more demand there is, the faster will automate. The faster we automate the better. The important question is not \u201cwho do we tax?\u201d The question should be \u201cwhat do we spend money on to effectively increase demand by the right amount?\u201d", "The.

However all were better than using regular cleaning products. I liked how well the hob cleaner really got every last bit of food and spill off the hob however found that it left quite a lot of smears and didn't remove all the watermarks. I wasn't 100% sure after reading the instructions if I had used the product correctly and felt it would have been useful to have some slightly clearer instructions for example explaining how long I needed to leave the product to work before wiping away. The stainless steel cleaner was my favourite as it left the area surrounding my hob looking so sparkly and clean. It made it look brand new again and the smallest bit of the product really went a long way. The oven de-greaser was also a really great product and I could instantly see the huge difference it made to my dirty, grease covered oven. It was also really effortless to wipe away the dirt and made cleaning the oven which is usually a big task a lot easier. Overall I was impressed with the products and the results and I may have even got better results with the hob cleaner after a few more uses. I do feel that the instructions could have been a little clearer on that product in particular so that I knew I was using the product correctly.

Conditions were fall-like with cool temps, breezy northwest winds and water temps between 69-71 degrees. We started out casting the rubber in channel areas where we located bait fish. We got bites but no hook ups. We then moved to more channel edges, but shallow. The boys caught sub-legal walleyes and medium sized crappies that were released. Lastly we marched up into the weeds. The action was pretty good. Nice pike were caught, keeper walleyes up to 19 \u00bd\u201d and slab crappie. Big bass goes to Tom 18+ small bass and a great release! Big walleye goes to Nick with a 21 \u00bd\u201d beauty! Great release! Congratulations to the boys! We caught quality fish on a tough day.\nJust before the weekend clients and I fished walleye and crappie. Conditions were sun to clouds, warm, and finally a south wind and water temps at 72 degrees. The first two hours, fishing was tough. We fished good spots but were only getting a few bites. Then things started to change; we began catching small walleye and pike on the channel edge. Later we moved shallow. Jim and Paul banged out slab crappies and keeper walleyes. It was a feeding frenzy of quality fish! At the end of the outing, Paul caught and released a dandy 21 \u00bd\u201d walleye! Great job! And just after dark he landed a decent pike on a jig. It truly was Paul\u2019s evening!

It is sometimes referred to as Sabbath-rest, the Lord\u2019s Day, and the first day of the week which all point back to the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the culmination of his victory over sin and death with his second coming.\nHow do we honor his resurrection and adhere to the rhythm that is announced in the creation principle is connected to the well-being of mankind and the prescription dictated by God. For most of us the suggestion that we should or even could clear our calendars once a week brings nothing but a cynical smile or a wishful sigh.

Because his parents were performing musicians, they were able to give James support and teaching. James Bradley, Jr. was a child-drumming prodigy and at the age of four he was recognized as the worlds youngest professional drummer. Appearing on major television shows in the sixties such as \"I've Got A Secret\", \"Steve Allen\", \"Jack Benny\", \"Art Linkletter\", \"Nat King Cole\", \"Hollywood Palace\", and many others. And then a contract with Paramount Pictures, where JBJ played a part in the movie \"Cool Hand Luke\".\nDeveloping from a Jazz and Blues background James began playing straight ahead Jazz with his mother in his very early teens. He completed his first National Tour in 1976 with Deniece Williams while still in high school. JBJ then traveled with the great Chuck Mangione from 1977 to 1981 boasting many gold records like the hit song \"Feel So Good\". After a short break in 1982 JBJ was doing musical workshops and clinics. James went on to create the group Urban Gypsy which fused Rock and Funk. Then he toured with R&B superstar Anita Baker 1986-87, legendary Pianist Joe Sample 1987-1988, and with R&B great Vocalist Jeffrey Osborne 1988-1989. In the nineties JBJ hooked up with alternative rockers Mary's Danish, The Go Go's Gina Shock, The Beastie Boys, Slash and many others.

There are other issues involving the eyes, such as being born with a monolid, that are not caused by age but still may require treatment for certain patients. There are several procedures available for treating these conditions that are designed to help improve your eyes.\nIf your eyebrows have started to flatten out, it can make you look upset or angry when that is not really the case. This can affect the eyes because it makes it hard to convey what you are truly feeling with them. An eyebrow lift surgery is a great way of treating this issue. During the procedure, our expert in eyebrow lift surgery in Beverly Hills will make an incision along the forehead near the hairline. The skin will then be lifted and excess skin will be removed. The skin will then be reattached at the incision. Your eyebrows will be brought back to the natural arch aesthetics of youth, making it much easier to express how you are feeling.\nA double eyelid surgery is done to place a crease into the upper eyelid of a patient who was born lacking such a crease. While a monolid can function just fine, many patients prefer the aesthetics of the double-lidded look. Contact our expert in double eyelid surgery in Beverly Hills to schedule a consultation if you are interested in improving your eyes using this surgery.", "Mississauga politics, dominated for decades by Hazel McCallion, is not a sport for amateurs or pushovers. So it\u2019s not surprising that Bonnie Crombie (BA 1982 St. Michael\u2019s) emerged as McCallion\u2019s successor after a political trial by fire that included a short, tumultuous stint in the federal Liberal caucus, cyberstalking by a self-styled Mississauga watchdog and even a local fight over a crematorium development.\nCrombie, who studied political science, economics and international relations, says her undergraduate experience sparked her interest in public policy and administration. \u201cU of T encouraged me to become more involved in the political process.\u201d A long-time Liberal and former government relations executive, Crombie entered federal politics in 2008, running for the federal Liberals in the riding of Mississauga Streetsville. Crombie jumped to municipal politics after losing the seat during the Conservatives\u2019 2011 sweep, urged by McCallion to run in a council by-election. Facing a high-profile challenger \u2013 outspoken McCallion critic Carolyn Parrish (BA 1969 St. Michael\u2019s, BEd 1970) \u2013 Crombie squeaked into office, besting her rival by 241 votes in a crowded field. During McCallion\u2019s final term, Crombie\u2019s name surfaced regularly as a potential successor.\nNoting that U of T Mississauga injects $1.3 billion annually into the Peel Region economy, Crombie says she sees the campus as \u201ca nucleus for ideas, innovation and excellence\u201d and points to her record of supporting the city\u2019s $10-million investment in UTM\u2019s Innovation Complex and the I-Cube accelerator.

Starting a bookkeeping company has become a very attractive option for many individuals who wish to tackle a growing market and need for bookkeepers. Small businesses are always on the hunt for qualified and reliable bookkeepers to assist their business operations. With the booming start-up trend, there has never been a better time to start bookkeeping for them!\nThe first step to starting a bookkeeping company involved training and educating. Any person interested must become trained in the art of bookkeeping. An education involving accounting or business may be helpful but does not automatically make one qualified to bookkeep. It is a delicate and specialized field that can only be mastered through practicing and perfecting. Fluency in programs, such as QuickBooks, is a minimum requisite to starting the company. The dangers in not being qualified include quickly losing reputation and esteem from customers.\nThe next step involves a personal decision. It is probably not advisable for anyone to abruptly end their day job to tackle a bookkeeping company full-time. Instead, one must decide whether they wish to work on their company after-hours at home or in the office. Both options offer advantages and disadvantages. Starting the company from the day job could offer networks and resources necessary to building the company. However, working from home provides comfort and individualized autonomy in managing the company. There will be a time when the business may outgrow the confines of the home as well. One must be prepared to make the decision as to where the business will be.", "Nonlinear energy sink and Eurocode 8: an optimal design approach based on elastic response spectra\n2020-06-30T10:22:52Z (GMT) by\nIn this paper, the authors propose novel empirical formulae for the optimal design of Nonlinear Energy Sinks (NESs) to control seismic induced vibrations in structures. While large part of the existing literature on NES for seismic applications is based on deterministic analyses of the structural response to recorded ground motions, herein the effectiveness of the device is studied in a stochastic framework. In fact, the seismic excitation has been modeled using a response spectra consistent power spectral density function, taking into account design spectra prescribed into Eurocode 8. Statistics of the structural response have been determined by Monte Carlo Simulations, performing nonlinear time-domain analyses to investigate the dependence of the optimal NES parameters on the main characteristics of the primary system and on the seismic load amplitude. The outcomes of these analyses have been translated into empirical expressions allowing for computing the optimal NES stiffness and damping. Since these are closed-form relationships depending on the main structure and the response spectra parameters, their use allows for an immediate estimate of the NES optimal design configuration, avoiding demanding numerical analyses and making their implementation suitable for practical engineering purposes. The accuracy of the design formulae has been tested by comparison with numerical optimisations for a set of possible configurations of the main structure and for varying intensity of the external excitation. Although the proposed relationships have been extrapolated from single degree of freedom system responses, applications to multi degree of freedom structures is quite straightforward, as shown through two case studies involving the analysis of a 2D multistorey structure and a 3D multi-bay frame controlled by two orthogonal NESs.", "Ontoawinner, one of the fastest growing syndicates in the country are expanding their portfolio of horses for next year.

The Summit Fire burned approximately 4,270 acres in the headwaters of the Corralitos and Soquel watersheds, as well as the Uvas Creek watershed in Santa Clara County, threatening to introduce potentially large and persistent sediment loads into the channel systems.\nBeginning in winter 2009, Balance staff identified 10 sites (including 1 each in the Browns and East Fork Upper Soquel Creek systems) to conduct both pre- and post-rainy season monitoring of channel bed conditions and bed elevation, along with sediment transport measurements during storms. Some monitoring locations are reoccupations of sites selected for almost identical assessment following the catastrophic January 4-5, 1982 storm, thus enabling a comparison between post-fire response in 2009 with the only other major episodic watershed disturbance in the past 50-60 years.\nFlooding risk was assessed via bedload and suspended load transport measurements and calculations during storm events, coupled with cross-section surveys that identified detectable bed elevation change at key locations along the creek corridors. Senior geomorphic and engineering staff worked with County Flood Control managers to identify likely locations subject to flooding along Corralitos Creek and assisted in evaluating conveyance capacity. Salmonid habitat was assessed through repeated cross-section surveys that identified scour or filling of representative habitat features (pools, glides, or riffles), along with repeated bed condition measurements consisting of a modified pebble count and habitat element survey at select locations. In this rare but necessary and exceedingly important approach, Balance assisted the County in forging a coalition between floodplain management and salmonid habitat interests to respond to the potential hazards posed by the Summit Fire.", "Began to Bleed. On 29 May, 1187, a number of mercenaries and bandits were playing with dice before the door of the church at D\u00e9ols. One of these fellows, who had lost a throw, cursing and swearing, took up a stone, which he flung at the figure of Our Lady with the Child over the sacred portal. The arm of the Infant JESUS was snapped in twain. A stream of blood poured from the arm of the broken image and made a pool on the earth below. The wretch who flung the stone was seized with madness, and dropped down dead upon the spot. The blood was carefully collected in a phial which was deposited in an Oratory dedicated to Our Lady. Numberless cures were effected, and a Confraternity which was founded in honour of the miracle flourished until the Revolution. It was reorganized in 1830, and on 31 May there is a solemn Commemoration of the Blood-shedding of Notre Dame de D\u00e9ols.\nAfter S. Paul of the Cross (1694-1775) had preached for the last time in the church of Piagaro, a Crucifix over one of the side-altars was seen to be oozing with blood. Hundreds witnessed the miracle, and later a chapel was built to enshrine the Miraculous Cross. In 1630 at Spoleto, drops of blood flowed from the head of a figure of Our Lord Crowned with Thorns. Even in this unbelieving age the Most Holy Crucifix of Limpias, El Santo Cristo de la Agonia, sweats blood, whilst tears have been observed in the eyes, which turn from side to side, and the head sometimes moves as in all the weariness of bitter pain. Very many other instances of similar miracles mighy be cited.", "Hi, I think what you are after is the multivariate normal distribution.. If so, then you can vectorize the density calculation.

If you\u2019re someone that\u2019s new to programming, one of the best and ideal languages to use when you\u2019re starting out is PHP. This is a hypertext preprocessor that deals mainly with HTML commands that are fairly easier to use and understand as opposed to different languages such as C and Perl. Think of it as a simplistic version of programming that easier to understand but quicker to use. However with the relative ease of this programming language comes various limitations wherein C and Perl would be considered as superior to PHP. However, as an entry to the programming world, PHP is definitely a great place to start. You will almost immediately be able to write simple scripts from the first time you learn this language. And as you become more and more familiar and experienced at PHP, you\u2019ll also realize that it also contains advanced features that are suited for professional programmers. In other words, PHP is a great way to break in to the programming world because it has a wide range of applications that are both for beginners and experts. So whether you\u2019re in high school or you\u2019re trying to learn programming as a hobby or a sideline, the most ideal language to work with is definitely PHP.

After another couple of months running was turning into an addiction and, following advice from a friend who was into running, I was forcing myself into not increasing my weekly mileage excessively. Despite this I contracted my first injury after about 6 months, and for the first time experienced the feeling of desperately wanting to run, but not being able to. Lesson learned. I recovered from the injury and slowly, very slowly, increased my mileage. Of course this didn't stop me from getting injured again and I think I can count up to four different injuries that I have been struggling with since (stress fracture to the shin, strained calves, non-identifiable pain to the foot, and patellofemoral pain syndrome).\nSince 2009 I have been keeping an online diary of my running at a Swedish site called jogg.se, and can therefore view my improvements in retrospect.

It might seems like a massive increase, but if you instead view 2012 as an anomaly it makes a lot more sense. 3000 km over the course of one years makes roughly 8 km per day, every day of the year, which I must say I'm pretty pleased with.", "First of all, thanks so much to Justice(ness) for teaching me how to use the free text thingie.

Wet Widow After more than a year of silence, the French duo VTCN RADIO releases its debut album \u201cMydriase\u201d on November 10th 2017. Mysterious and audacious odyssey, \u2018Mydriase\u2019 presents itself as a sensory and confidential journey. Fruit of a nocturnal composition guided by a need of musical introspection and a decisive encounter with an owl, the writing of this album will cut off its creators in an alternative reality for three years. Behind VTCN RADIO are the French producers Nathan Bokobza - a pianist fascinated by the romantic repertoire and the harmonic research of the impressionists - and Louis Martinez, a guitarist passionate about digital technologies and their uses in the process of sound creation. The group revealed its existence at the end of 2015 with the esoteric Riddle Song and continues to surprise the spirits with the release of the compositions Late Night Shuttle and Venus Flytrap in 2016, before creating in 2017 their own label \u201cFive to Six Records\". VTCN RADIO presents with Mydriase an experience based mainly on the dialogue between two entities - a dark, deep and a purer and luminescent - to constitute an elegant music, and ambivalent by its capacity to propose different interpretations. This self-produced album marks the first release of their label Five to Six Records, and presents us for the first time in a broader way the hallucinatory and singular universe of VTCN RADIO.", "Alice will continue to accomplish medications without her family members\u2019 knowledge.\nAlice will continue to complete medications without her family members\u2019 knowledge.

Both, the CD4+ as well as the CD8+ T cell subsets are affected. A large percentage of CD4+ V beta 17a+ T cell hybrids recognize IE molecules. We now have investigated the reactivity for IE antigens of CD8+ V beta 17a+ T cell hybrids. Using a transfection approach, we have introduced the murine CD8 molecule into different V beta 17a+ T cell hybrids. Furthermore, the CD8 cDNA was transfected into the BW5147 alpha-beta- fusion partner. This allowed us to generate a large number of V beta 17a+ T cell hybrids by fusion with the appropriate T cells. Only 6% of T cell hybrids were stimulated to produce IL-2 upon incubation with IE+ cells. However, in those, the CD8 molecule seemed not to contribute to the IE reactivity of the hybrid, since mAbs against the CD8 molecule failed to inhibit their reactivity. This low percentage of V beta 17a+ CD8+ IE-reactive T cell hybrids contrasts with the strong reduction of CD8+ V beta 17a+ T cells in IE+ mice, strongly suggesting that elimination of such cells in the thymus occurs when they are coexpressing CD4 and CD8. This view was confirmed by the occasional expression of CD4 in some hybrids in which case IE reactivity was detected. Furthermore, we demonstrated the functional integrity of the introduced CD8 molecule by: (a) reconstitution of the IL-2 response in a class I-restricted TNP-specific T cell hybrid; and (b) by generation of alloreactive class I-restricted T cell hybrids using the new CD8+ fusion cell line. This CD8+ fusion partner, BWLyt2- 4, should prove useful to study antigen processing and antigen presentation requirements of class I-restricted T cells.", "Periodic Properties of The Elements Under: Flash Cards Valence Orbitals Orbitals that contain the outer-shell electrons of an atom.

The format is spearheading Leclerc\u2019s development in France and substantially contributes to reaching the retailer\u2019s goal of overcoming Carrefour, the current market leader.

A 100m-wide knot of scruffy old buildings, shops and services surrounds the train station, while a new satellite town coalesces 3km south. With Kota Bharu just a couple of hours away, the Malay accent here displays a distinctive Kelantanese twang, and alcohol is practically unavailable (for more on Kelantan society and politics, see chapter 4). Gua Musang is fairly close to Taman Negara entrances at Merapoh and Kuala Koh; time spent between connections can be filled exploring the caves that riddle a mass of limestone above the train station. To reach the caves, cross the rail track at the station and walk through the small kampung in the shadow of the rock behind the station. Once you\u2019ve scrambled up the 20m-high rock face, along a loose path, you\u2019ll see a narrow ledge; turn left and edge carefully along until you see a long slit in the rock that leads into a cave \u2013 you\u2019ll need to be fairly thin to negotiate it. The interior is enormous, 60m long and 30m high in places, and well lit by sunlight from holes above. The main cave leads to lesser ones, where rock formations jut from the walls and ceilings. The only way out is by the same route, which you\u2019ll need to take very carefully, especially the near-vertical descent off the ledge and back down to the kampung.", "Annika Falkengren Why did you apply to SEB's Trainee Programme? My first contact with SEB was as a summer intern at one of our Stockholm branch offices. I liked the work so much that I stayed on for three years! I really enjoyed meeting customers every day and handling their varying needs. And my impressions lasted: having finished university I applied to SEB's trainee program. I wanted to get back to the mindset of long-term relationships, to the business acumen and all the great people in SEB. Looking back at your year as a trainee, what were the greatest experiences? A trainee year with SEB is a very special time. You are introduced to a new company, to different roles, and you are exposed to several new situations, but at the same time it is a very structured year with a clear start and end. I was still in the midst of the trainee program when I suggested some major changes to it. I was asked to present them to the CEO and the next year I found myself responsible for the entire trainee program! What benefits has the trainee year given you in your further career? As a trainee you come across different parts of the bank and you really learn a lot about how things work in practice. Today - being CEO - I can still raise quite detailed questions about the business, even though I am not part of the daily operations as before. It goes back to knowing the business very well and having worked my way up. You also build up a network of people, with whom you keep in touch over the years and can turn to for an informal discussion, trouble-shooting or knowledge sharing. That is truly a great benefit.", "It is now official that Legendary Pictures and Universal will be bringing us a new installment in the Gareth Edwards Godzilla franchise. Not exactly a huge surprise since Godzilla is the highest grossing film of 2014. Still this leaves a lot of fans asking, what's next? Well no one is one hundred percent sure yet. Many feel that introducing some of the classic monsters is the right way to go though. The main actor of the film, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, even went on record saying he could see Mothra in a future movie. Not a huge stretch if you notice how moths show up a few times in the film's background, and how many references the director made to the classic Toho films. Even the way Godzilla looks is just a tribute to the classic movies.\nSo what about the classic [Godzilla](movie:45291) foes? Well there is a lot to study there. First we have to remember that it is a whole different monster. The chief creative officer, Jon Jashni, was quoted saying that the creative team's first goal was to \"re-brand and re-establish the franchise.\" Mind this had a lot to do with the 1998 Godzilla film, but any franchise needs to establish it's own identity. Makes it seem unlikely does it not? Still there will be monsters in future films, and why not reference some of the classics? I know I would love to see King Ghidorah make a return to film, but only time will tell. Until then, chime in on your thoughts below. Do you want to see classic Godzilla foes, or do you think a sequel is a bad idea in the first place?", "I am a newcomer to GNUstep. I think the biggest thing that would help GNUstep is documentation. I know that when I first began using Objective-C, if it weren't for those two or three people in #objc on irc.openprojects.net, I would have never made it. Sure, there is a little documentation on Objective-C in general on the internet, but nothing really up-to-date. I find myself mucking through the GNUstep code way too much to see how things work, and I know that would scare many beginners away. Objective-C, imho, is a very easy programming language to learn and to use and its very powerful, but more up-to-date documentation has to exist for it to gain popularity. My 2nd idea is simply the same thing that Nahuel said, get some binary packages going and you will probably find popularity skyrocketing. I know that unless I was interested in actually developing with GNUstep, there is no way I would go through the pain of making the whole library just to run other people's applications. I must say though, I am -=very=- impressed by the amount of work that has went into GNUstep. Its quite an impressive and mostly complete set of libraries.

Studied first with his mother, who was a good pianist and from whom he probably inherited his musical ability. When fifteen years old he went to Cincinnati, where he studied at the College of Music for two years. In 1883 he went to Berlin and studied counterpoint and composition with Vierling and Urban. Later he entered the Cologne Conservatory, where he studied with G. Jensen, Wuellner and Neitzel and finally went to Breslau and worked under Max Bruch. While at Breslau he wrote his cantata, The Wild Chase. He now returned to St. Louis, where he taught and also traveled as an opera-conductor and violinist. Later, Arnold was instructor of harmony at the National Conservatory under Dvorak. In a number of his compositions, especially his Plantation Dances, Arnold has made use of the negro plantation idea, not by introducing negro melodies but by embodying the African spirit in his own work. Arnold has also written two comic operas; a Dramatic Overture; a Valse Elegante, for eight hands for the piano; a Danse de la Midway Plaisance and a Tarantelle for the orchestra; also a fugue for eight hands; a Minstrel Serenade for violin and piano; part songs and some solos. His violin sonata, which has not been published, is also in the African style. He is at work upon a symphony and a book on Some Points in Modern Orchestration. Arnold is at present musical director of the Progressive Stage Society of New York.", "In the Baltic clam Macoma balthica from the Gulf of Gdansk, neoplasia is considered as a serious epizootic linked to bad environmental conditions and high levels of pollutants. Previous research was focused on the diagnosis, prevalence, seasonality and histopathological characteristic of the cancer. This study is focused on electron microscopy analyses describing cell ultrastructure abnormalities related to neoplasia. Examinations using the electron microscopy highlighted changes confined to anatomic ultrastructures, shapes and functions of neoplastic cells. The lobulated appearance of the nucleus, changes in cellular matrix and the occurrence of large granular cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, atypical Golgi structures and deterioration of rough endoplasmic reticulum manifested the disease. The presence of atypical mitochondria, free ribosomes and hypertrophic nuclei suggests the adaptation of neoplastic cells to increased mitotic activity, while the observed modification of cellular membranes may reflect functional changes connected to increased pinocytotic activity or intercellular transport. The cancer cells were found to appear in two types, abnormal round-shaped cells and spindle-shaped cells, both with increased frequencies of cell division. Round-shaped cells typical for disseminated neoplasia were observed in all affected bivalves, in a few cases co-occurring with abnormal spherical cells. Spindle-shaped cells containing some intracytoplasmic filaments, and with a tendency of the nuclei to be orientated as in a palisade were interpreted as myofibroblasts-like cells and were observed in five out of eleven clams diagnosed as neoplastic. This finding represents the first demonstration of phenotypic differences in the cell types co-occurring in animals diagnosed as neoplastic and by that suggests coexistence of two types of bivalve cancer, disseminated neoplasia and probable fibrosarcoma.", "all i want is to eat good food and cook. when you like to eat, sometimes you dont know how to cook and other way around. when you know how to cook, you dont eat the food you prepared cause you want others to appreciate it. and when you eat you want to enjoy it. i should say that i love good food and eat. i also know how to cook (with the help of a cook book). i love eating spaghetti. its my comfort food. i also learned to cook it a year ago. when i move out from our home so i can establish my solo life. started to boil the spaghetti noodles, and get ready sauce. yes, i should say that my first attempt to cook this food is a success. but after two plates, i started to get dizzy. maybe too much ground beef. then i learned to cook ulam for lunch and dinner. setting aside from cooking eggs, hotdogs and some preservatives. i also love some chocolates, and ice creams. ice creams always makes me feel like a child. it gives me my kiddie smile. i dont like fish, shrimps and hard to eat sea creatures. i dont like the deboning and unshelling. call me lazy, but i dont do that. but i should say there are delicious. i know that there are alot of foods that i want, would like and will try to cook. maybe, a culinary school would help me with dream or explore it by myself. but for now i will enjoy my cotton candy in hand and give my big childish smile. \ud83d\ude00\nLESSONS ABOUT FOOD\nAdvertisements", "Yao and artusio anesthesiology problem oriented patient management 7th edition pdfPenicillate dishelm Verney, her dripping conjectures Denominational deoxygenation.

But the truth is, in an industry that relies as heavily on distributed labor as gaming does, a single bad decision on the screen is often the result of hundreds of awful ideas from people up and down the line, each screwing up in their own individual (and institutional) ways. That\u2019s the joy of Blood, Sweat, And Pixels: The Triumphant, Turbulent Stories Behind How Video Games Are Made, written by our colleague Jason Schreier over at Kotaku, which charts the troubled history of 10 big-name games from the last 10 years, outlining where things did, and did not, go wrong. Part of the pleasure of Schreier\u2019s meticulously researched text is pure schadenfreude. I got a deep thrill out of knowing that Dragon Age: Inquisition, a game I quietly loathe, was just as much of a soulless mess in its internal workings as I\u2019d always suspected. But it\u2019s also a perfect picture of one of the youngest, most lucrative, and virulently mutation-prone industries in the pop culture world. Even two years out from its initial publication, Blood, Sweat, And Pixels still hits almost everything that\u2019s dominating the gaming world behind the scenes today: Crowdfunding, the increasing desire to treat games as constantly updating services (rather than standalone products), and, of course, the boogeyman lurking beneath every lushly animated 3D world or lovingly rendered cutscene: the life-destroying specter of 80-, 90-, and 100-hour work weeks that\u2019s colloquially known as \u201ccrunch.\u201d [William Hughes]", "1.

Simon works as an arborist and the Laburnum spoon he created is made from one of two trees that formed an arch over the entrance to an old house. That tree had to be removed after it was hit by a delivery van. The owner indicated that the tree was 100 years old and Simon counted about 60 growth rings or more. The tree had some decay but some of the sound wood was saved for special projects. His unsigned spoon arrived in April 2011. Its traditional spoon pattern takes full advantage of the grain and color of the wood. Of special note is the way he managed to center all of a small circular section in the middle of the notch just above the handle and the patterns on the top of the back of the handle and on both sides of the bowl. In addition this is a spoon that not only fits the hand perfectly but also has a special feeling to it when handled and rubbed or stroked. It is one of the finest tactile spoons in the collection.\nSaturday, 11 June 2011", "It was only when strangers started to come forth and tell me by showing me texts she had sent them that I could see the truth about her. I was hurt to say the least. She even went as far as using her own children to manipulate other women whose children had bonded with hers to blackmail these people into not coming to my 50th birthday party. I was shocked and in disbelief, but could not ignore the truth that faced me. This was only the beginning about this so-called friend. I have since learned that she was never my friend, but had a mad crush on my husband! She was so deranged that she is now friends with my husband's ex-wife! I figured those two deserved each other and I was so much better off without her in my life.\nWith friends like that, who needs enemies right? But, I am so blessed with great friendships with women and I value them greatly. What good is a best friend if you can't tell her your problems, secrets and share your joys? From this experience I have learned that even though I was hurt and betrayed, I have gained a more valuable friend in the one that came forth and told me the truth. She was a stranger that has turned into a valuable friend.\nSo girls keep your girlfriends close and value the sacred part of a woman's friendship. Don't do anything to betray that because as women we need other women in our lives. Please read, \"True Age, Timeless Beauty\" for more on this topic.", " Looks delicious!

According to analysts, any major increase or decrease in the Gulf Kingdom's crude production must be approved by the Monarch, who was reported last week to have heeded a call by US president George Bush and agreed to lift output by nearly 300,000 barrels per day to cool down boiling crude prices. Saudi Arabia, which controls nearly a quarter of the world's total extractable oil deposits, has pumped an average of nine million bpd over the past year but its sustainable output capacity is almost two million bpd higher. To face an expected increase in global demand, Riyadh is investing heavily in projects to boost its oil production capacity to 12.5 million bpd at the end of 2009 and maintain its traditional spare capacity of more than two million bpd. .\" According to the newspaper, Marri scoffed at what he called fears that the price of oil will decline after the development of more energy sources. \"These fears are unjustified because they come from the consumers who are only benefiting from higher production and from the country's enemies who do not like to see prosperity and progress in Saudi Arabia,\" he said.\"Even if other major sources of energy are developed, they will remain costly and oil will remain a strong rival in the energy field. \"", "The Coolest, Tiniest New Gaming Platform Hits Next MonthBrian Crecente8/11/11 12:40pmFiled to: SifteoHardwareTechToys103EditPromoteShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalink Sifteo, those tiny motion-aware game playing blocks we first spotted at CES, hit this September for $150 a pack, the company said today.

Prostatic ornithine decarboxylase activity was inhibited by 80%, whereas S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase was stimulated by more than 9-fold. In seminal vesicle, the inhibition of putrescine and spermidine accumulation, as well as of ornithine decarboxylase activity, was only minimal, and no stimulation of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase was observed. Administration of methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) to castrated androgen-treated rats resulted in a marked increase in concentrations of all prostatic polyamines. Prostatic ornithine decarboxylase activity was nearly 2 times and adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity 9 times higher than that of the testosterone-treated animals. In contrast with ventral prostate, methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) treatment inhibited moderately the accumulation of spermidine and spermine in seminal vesicle, although both ornithine decarboxylase and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activities were stimulated. Difluoromethylornithine inhibited significantly the weight gain of ventral prostate, but methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) produced a substantial increase in prostatic weight. These changes were largely due to the fact that the volume of prostatic secretion was greatly decreased by difluoromethylornithine, whereas methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) increased the amount of secretion. Treatment with difluoromethylornithine strikingly increased the methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) content of both ventral prostate and seminal vesicle, but even under these conditions the drug concentration remained low in comparison with other tissues. The results indicate that a combined use of these two polyamine anti-metabolites does not necessarily result in a synergistic growth inhibition of the androgen-induced growth of male accessory sexual glands.\n- \u00a9 1984 London: The Biochemical Society", "Christmas time is full of beauty and grace.

The three suspects first shot dead Raymond Samson who opened the gate, before shooting at the other victims around 8 p.m. The owner of the newly-built house, Mario Mendoza, died at the hospital. Mendoza and some of his friends were partying at their newly-built house when the suspects knocked on their gate. The suspects lobbed a grenade at the victims to cover their escape. Valeriano Nicolas survived the incident. He was among the guests at the party. Mendoza\u2019s six-year-old son also witnessed the incident. He escaped unscathed after hiding inside the house when the armed men arrived. Aside from Nicolas, three other men identified as Raul Samonte, Ronaldo dela Cruz and Alberto Alberto were also wounded in the attack. Mendoza\u2019s mother believes that the suspects were really after her son. The family is now coordinating with the police for the possible arrest of the suspects who are also tagged in the alleged kidnapping of one of their relatives. Meanwhile, authorities are also eyeing drugs in the incident after a sachet of suspected shabu was recovered from one of the victims.

I started to go up stairs like a normal person two weeks ago instead of leading with the good leg for each step. The pain coincides with that and I finally realized it when I tried to go up some stairs yesterday and it bothered me. My quads are still pretty week so it is putting too much pressure on the joint. I guess that is to be expected not even 10 weeks post pao, but it surprised me. I am so used to doing what I want and apparently I can't. Today I had to suck it up and get back to the elliptical machine so I can strengthen the quads and hopefully that will ease the pain. It is a catch 22 because it hurts to do the elliptical, but it is for the greater good of the hip so I will keep it up. Now I have to go to bed because my alarm will be going off at 3:30am so I can be at work by 5am to register for all of our summer programs. April 1st is the kickoff to summer for all of our programs and all staff has to be there. I guess it is a good day when you can register 1000 kids for summer camps in 2 hours.

Let me be clear, it is me who is struggling, I am in no way obliged by anyone else to work in my hours off. Being clear and strong about asking for meetings on days that I am paid to work sits uncomfortably with me. I have difficulties switching off on a Friday, knowing that the email inbox is filling up, knowing that colleagues have fed back that I am difficult to get hold of.\nI am very clear in my own mind that being effective is getting as much done as possible in the hours I am supposed to work.

Of course I read and replied to a couple of other emails too.\nI am trying very hard not to apologise for not being there today and also aware that the shorter week is making me feel less work-efficient than usual.

Here we compare undoped Li(1-x)FePO(4) of 113 nm, 42 nm, and 34 nm average particle size, and three aliovalent solute doped compositions formulated for dopant substitution on the Li (M1) site with charge compensation by Li vacancies: Li(0.90)Mg(0.05)FePO(4), Li(0.80)Zr(0.05)FePO(4), and Li(0.70)Zr(0.075)FePO(4). The results first show that a diffusive component can be measured with reasonable accuracy in all samples, allowing determination of the lithium chemical diffusion coefficient D as a function of potential or state-of-charge. In addition, a method is illustrated for the separation of capacity due to diffusive transport from that due to the first-order phase transition. Using the combined analyses, the effects of particle size reduction and aliovalent doping are readily understood. Both effects contribute to a reduced lithium miscibility gap and a greater contribution to stored capacity of the (faster) diffusive process. Simultaneously, the rate of phase transformation within the miscibility gap is also increased. Highly doped samples exhibit a complete lithium solid solution at room temperature, and have 1-2 orders of magnitude higher D at potentials where significant capacity is stored. This translates to improved capacity retention at high cycling rates, albeit at the expense of reduced absolute capacity due to Li diffusion channel blocking. Google Scholar", "It seems like one of the latest trends for the large meetings and events tradeshows is to segue off into \"technology-focused\" mini-tradeshows such as ASAE for associations, ASTD for training and HSMAI for corporate and independent meeting professionals. We saw this trending last year with MPI-WEC in Montreal when they grouped all of the technology providers for online registration such as Cvent, StarCite and Certain and other meeting and event software technologies in one exhibit area. It makes so much more sense when you think of the plight of the meeting professional who is inundated with the huge hotel venue exhibits, and trying to get through to the guy (or gal) in the back of the exhibit hall with the event management software demo. Let's face it would you rather drink a mai tai in the Hawaii booth, or ...well, you get my drift.\nWe just got back from the ASAE Technology Conference & Expo held in Washington DC last week. Once again, it was a technology focused show aimed at the association market. We were one of the only online registration providers to exhibit since most of the big players were the pure membership management providers like iMIS,Q, netFORUM (what is it with the CAPS?). We enjoy a very good relationship with associations, not only for their annual conference registration, but for their increased attendance through our email marketing and our ability to import a large amount of membership information.\nAnother team from Certain just got back from MPI-PEC in Houston last week where we participated in the technology playground and demonstrated Certain Registration.

Fascism is a kind of politics distinguished by ideology, although it draws on no single or coherent philosophy. Full-blooded fascist States have been ones espousing authoritarianism, militarism, a majoritarian kind of nationalism, racism, statolatry, elitism and the ruthless suppression of labour. Out of crises, they have developed institutions that contrive to unify apparently antagonistic class interests in the name of \u2018the nation\u2019. Analysts of fascist States have emphasised the primacy of politics. They also point to the considerable variety of political and ideological forms this politics has taken. Yet, while they also argue that there is no model economic base, comparative historical studies of the economies of fascist States in Europe and Latin America have shown there to be economic conditions and institutions that are necessary to give fascism state power \u2013 even if they are not by themselves sufficient for fascism to develop. Although it takes me outside the original project, outside the Indian economy and outside my conclusions, my last task needs to be to ask how the proto-fascist tendencies in India's politics and culture relate to the larger part of India's economic base, which is socially rather than state-regulated.", "Focus Shohei Imamura\nBorn in 1926, Sh\u014dhei Imamura finds out that he wants to become a director when he discovers Akira Kurosawa\u2019s Drunken angel.

It had asked the Committee Man about it, and the Committee Man had said cryptically, \"For some omelets, you need a large number of eggs,\" and laughed in a way that disturbed the stone greatly.\nThe stone, however, didn't see any harm in the enactments, nor did it see any point, really. And the Committee Man was keeping it well fed with all kinds of exotic scones, and nobody seemed to be getting hurt. So it sat grimly in its office, stamping documents and minding its own business, having of course realized long ago that it could never open a tattooing parlor in Amsterdam and just once in its life be really hip, that was just a childish fantasy it was better off without.", " tension that even his foam roller at home could not exercise. preferred a guy, usually stated.

Such \\textit{transferability} is achieved in recent studies through querying the target model to obtain data for training the substitute models... A real-world target, likes the FR system of law enforcement, however, is less accessible to the adversary. To attack such a system, a substitute model with similar quality as the target model is needed to identify their common defects. This is hard since the adversary often does not have the enough resources to train such a powerful model (hundreds of millions of images and rooms of GPUs are needed to train a commercial FR system). We found in our research, however, that a resource-constrained adversary could still effectively approximate the target model's capability to recognize \\textit{specific} individuals, by training \\textit{biased} substitute models on additional images of those victims whose identities the attacker want to cover or impersonate. This is made possible by a new property we discovered, called \\textit{Nearly Local Linearity} (NLL), which models the observation that an ideal DNN model produces the image representations (embeddings) whose distances among themselves truthfully describe the human perception of the differences among the input images. By simulating this property around the victim's images, we significantly improve the transferability of black-box impersonation attacks by nearly 50\\%. Particularly, we successfully attacked a commercial system trained over 20 million images, using 4 million images and 1/5 of the training time but achieving 62\\% transferability in an impersonation attack and 89\\% in a dodging attack.

Playwright and performer Pat Kinevane brings extravagant expressiveness to the role of Tino McGoldrick, a homeless drinker. Blending flamenco and cabaret, he sings and struts like a diva, as scenes from his past are replayed in the style of a beautiful black-and-white film. Accompanied by lush strings and voiceover, his interior world is portrayed as a clamour of voices, churning up guilty memories of his young brother's suicide, his own failed marriage and descent into alcoholism.\nWhat in other hands might be relentlessly grim material is saved by Tino's mocking black humour. Keeping self-pity at bay, his wit skewers those around him: his grotesque mother, the small-town citizens who bullied his brother for being \"a faggot\", the psychiatric doctors blithely writing prescriptions for medication until his condition was \"way beyond the cuckoo's nest\". His monologue is punctuated by jokes about a mental health helpline \u2013 \"if you are obsessive-compulsive, press One repeatedly.\"\nAs with Kinevane's previous one-man show, Forgotten, there is a serious purpose here. Director Jim Culleton and Fishamble theatre company, who produced both plays, are drawing attention to the lives of people who are mentally ill. At times, Kinevane's script explicitly addresses this, referring to all the buildings currently lying empty in Dublin while so many are sleeping rough. And he pays tribute to support received from the Samaritans and Simon Community. While these references can seem too directly proselytising, they are quickly subsumed into the dazzling theatricality of this piece, as Tino uncovers yet another fragment of memory. Dancing a tango with his shabby blanket and buttonholing the audience with immense charm, he refuses to lie down and go", "MonTEC plays an integral part in the entrepreneurship ecosystem of Western Montana by providing networking, mentorship and funding opportunities for a wide range of early stage ventures. Its 32,000 square foot facility is also a critical component of MonTEC's role by offering start-ups first rate conferencing space, common work areas, break rooms, 1 GB internet access, office/working spaces of various sizes, as well as microbiological and chemical laboratories. There are two levels of engagement with MonTEC: Affiliate Company or Resident Company.\nAffiliate companies are essentially given a key to the building and have complete access to the facility with the exception of having a lock and key office. Businesses often use this status when they are at the point of approaching early sales or investment, and need a professional front for their business without the hassle of leasing or maintaining an office. Affiliates make great use of conferencing spaces as well as basic services such as mail and copying.\nResident companies receive the same full access as described above for affiliates, however they also pay a tiered/subsidized rental rate for a space combination fitting of the business' needs. Businesses are typically ready for space when they begin hiring full time employees, securing investment/contracts and need a synergistic space for their team to work on a daily basis. Some companies utilize a single office to house multiple employees while others have a mix of office and laboratory spaces. The typical time for a business to spend as a resident company ranges from two to four years during which MonTEC acts as a partner to accommodate growth renovations to get the business to a point where they are ready to enter the commercial real estate market and sustain growth.", "Please Pray for Salvation\nLast night on the bus was incredible. The first person we ministered to was a teenager. He was 14 years old. He has been arrested 2 times already on felony charges. His dad has never been involved in his life. He left when he was a baby. This young man is pretty much raising himself. He was very well spoken. He was extremely honest about his life. He was fixated on us as we shared the Gospel with him. We gave him a bible and lots of pizza. We prayed with him. Please pray for his Salvation! The Lord will change his life completely. He has our phone number. We met many others last night. Darryl came aboard and rode with us for a while. He has been on meth for years. His family has dismissed him from their lives.

This can modify the reflected solar radiation and the thermal radiation emitted to space. Measurements of tropospheric CCN and IN over large areas have not been possible and can be only roughly approximated from satellite-sensor-based estimates of optical properties of aerosols. Our lack of ability to measure both CCN and cloud updrafts precludes disentangling the effects of meteorology from those of aerosols and represents the largest component in our uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing. Ways to improve the retrieval accuracy include multiangle and multipolarimetric passive measurements of the optical signal and multispectral lidar polarimetric measurements. Indirect methods include proxies of trace gases, as retrieved by hyperspectral sensors. Perhaps the most promising emerging direction is retrieving the CCN properties by simultaneously retrieving convective cloud drop number concentrations and updraft speeds, which amounts to using clouds as natural CCN chambers. These satellite observations have to be constrained by in situ observations of aerosol-cloud-precipitation-climate (ACPC) interactions, which in turn constrain a hierarchy of model simulations of ACPC. Since the essence of a general circulation model is an accurate quantification of the energy and mass fluxes in all forms between the surface, atmosphere and outer space, a route to progress is proposed here in the form of a series of box flux closure experiments in the various climate regimes. A roadmap is provided for quantifying the ACPC interactions and thereby reducing the uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing.", "Fall and Winter Landscapes\nEveryone knows how beautiful a spring landscape can be with all of the emerging foliage and flowering that happens. For me I think the Fall and even the winter can display awesome colors, textures and elements that may go unnoticed. Most trees have some sort of fall color that combined with other elements in the landscape that show a different perspective. As landscape designers we look for plants that have at least 3 seasons of interest. That could be flowers, foliage color, texture, fall color, form, bark, berries or some other interesting feature that is unique to that plant or group of plants. Then you have hardscape elements such as boulders, statuary, water features, walls, patios and walkways that add another dimension to the landscape. These all add different interests at different times of the year with elements from season to season. One of my favorite landscape elements is low voltage lighting. It not only is good for safety reasons but it extends the enjoyment of the landscape into the night. Good professionally installed lighting can really add to the interest and enjoyment of a landscape. In the winter when the nights are longer it just shows off your landscape, and if it snows, that just makes it that much better.My whole point is that the Fall and Winter can be of great interest, beauty and enjoyment of the landscape. Don't make your landscape just about the spring flowers! If you think only about the foliage and flowers you may just be missing out!

Some designers also include a link for their LinkedIn profile, which is especially useful today. This will allow your audience for more information about your specialist story and express their very own opinions. Much better contact information, you must also include a COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS section to be able to address inquiries and concerns that buyers may include.\nFinally, guarantee that your profile website includes a contact webpage.

According to Dr. Alex Collantes of the Davao Crocodile Park in Davao City, who travelled to Bunawan town in Agusan del Sur earlier in the day Sunday to check on the crocodile at the request of its keepers, Lolong died at 8:12 p.m. \"Talagang wala nang buhay si Lolong, diretsong patay 8:12 p.m.,\" Bunawan mayor Edwin Elorde also said in an interview on dzBB radio. The reason for the keepers' call to Collantes has not been given, nor has Lolong's cause of death been determined. A National Geographic team measures Lolong when he was first taken into captivity. Photo by Richard Grande However, Elorde said that Lolong began to act irregularly shortly after Tropical Cyclone Pablo devastated parts of Mindanao and Visayas last December. Elorde added that officials of the Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau (PAWB) will perform a\nnecropsy on the animal. The 21-foot, 1,075-kilogram saltwater crocodile was captured in a creek in the Bunawan barangay of Nueva Era in September 2011. It was given the name Lolong after crocodile hunter Ernesto \"Lolong\" Goloran Ca\u00f1ete, who died of a heart attack while searching for the animal. Lolong was certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest crocodile in captivity. \"He was measured by experienced handlers in his custom built enclosure at Bunawan Eco-Park and Research Center, Philippines. Lolong's weight was also measured at a nearby truck weigh-bridge and verified as approximately 1075 kg (2370 lbs),\" it said. \"The capture of the crocodile came after a two,\" it added. Elorde said that they plan to ask the National Museum for help in preserving Lolong's remains. \u2014 BM, GMA News", "My son just cracks me up. Ever since he started talking he's never ceased to amaze me with what comes out of his mouth.

About a year ago we had a bad storm come through and the power went out at our house. This was my son\u2019s, age three, first power outage and he was as much excited as nervous. We gathered up all the candles in the house and lit them in the living room. My wife and I discovered that we still have something to talk about after ten years of marriage; no television will do that to you. The conversation wondered back to the subject of the storm and the power outage and we had forgotten that our personal court reporter was still in the room. Speculating as to why the power went out I made the comment that a transformer must have blown up. My son immediately began going from window to window looking out with the excitement and anticipation of Christmas Eve. When asked what he was so excited about he replied, \" I sure hope it wasn't Megatron.....he's pretty tough!\" It took my wife and me a second to catch up with his imagination but when we did we had the best laugh. I gave my kid a hug and told him thank you....even though he didn't understand why.\nPublished August 26, 2008 More Info \u00bb\nAdvertisement", "Acer was founded in Taiwan in 1976 and began to focus on the Personal Computer in 1979.

Nelson, a Leisure Arts book published in 2010. This is my 3rd quilt, which I started July 19, 2015 and finished piecing on Sept 13, 2015. I used Hobbs Heirloom 100% cotton batt and the backing is 108\" wide Clara's Garden in the color Basil. Quilted by Lyn at Camlyn Quilts, finished size 80 X 80\". I made 4 pillow cases to match. I really wanted a green quilt for my last quilting project because green is my favorite color and who needs more than 3 quilts? (I'm a knitter and a spinner, and this quilting thing is just a hobby-bump-in-the-road, right?) I enjoyed this pattern a lot and learned how to piece tinier pieces than on my first 2 quilts, although not perfectly. I look at it now and wonder why it was ok to not fix some of the points of the pinwheels when I had the chance. I know Jenny says \"better done than perfect\" but I'm sure \"could have been better, if not perfect\" is the way I want to go. I don't care how long it takes me to make a quilt top, as it's the only one I'm working on anyway so I have the time. \"One project at a time\" is my motto! This doesn't mean I don't have fabric for future projects, just that I don't start more than one. (There's a cautionary knitting tale there, one involving 17 ufo's.)

(Kenneth K. Lam/The Baltimore Sun via AP)  hands up as 25-year-old Alex Brizzi. Brizzi's father Edward says his son had some sort of breakdown two weeks ago after his girlfriend broke up with him. He says his son believed he had a vision from God telling him the world was going to end June 3. Edward says his son was possibly trying to get the word out when he walked into the TV station. Before being shot by police, Brizzi handed a flash drive to a security guard at the TV station. The guard tells CBS Baltimore the drive contained a bunch of astronomy-related stuff, including information on the sun and black holes. \"He just wanted to say that the government was wrong in thinking about the way they do when it comes to anything in space,\u201d the guard says. Brizzi, who also allegedly set fire to his own car outside the TV station, is expected to survive. He's been charged with arson, malicious burning, threat of arson, reckless endangerment, and possessing a phony destructive device.

It remains unclear whether its haematological severity is linked with susceptibility to bleeding because the definition of the haematological severity of acquired von Willebrand syndrome has not been precisely determined. This study sought to establish a quantitative methodology to assess the haematological severity of acquired von Willebrand syndrome and to define the threshold for occurrence of GIB in patients implanted with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). METHODS: In total, 41 patients treated with continuous-flow LVAD implanted between 2011 and 2017 at Tohoku University Hospital were investigated. vWF large multimers were quantitatively evaluated using the \u2018vWF large multimer index\u2019 defined as the ratio of a large multimer proportion in total vWF derived from a patient to that from a normal control. Using this index, the amount of vWF large multimers was expressed as a percentage of its normal control value obtained with a simultaneous analysis of each time measurement. RESULTS: Twelve (29%) patients developed GIB events during follow-up periods (median 591 days) after an LVAD implantation. The vWF large multimer index in patients with GIB was significantly lower than that in those without GIB (25.0 \u00b1 10.3% vs 37.5 \u00b1 17.8%, P = 0.008). Most importantly, all patients experiencing GIB exhibited a vWF large multimer index below 40%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with GIB exhibited a more severe loss of vWF large multimers. The vWF large multimer index may dictate the risk of GIB after an LVAD implantation.", "Hi, I just wanted to introduce the Koo project to all kde-finance-apps members. Koo [1] is a client for OpenERP[2]/OpenObject[3] based on PyQt. It uses PyKDE if available, but by now, only for storing semantic information using Nepomuk. Although the official client for OpenERP is GTK based, with Koo we have some cool stuff, such as: - A model that can be used to access information on the application server from any Qt widget using interview. - Much better performance which allows using the client with a WAN between the client and the server. - Better API which makes creating new applications based on the platform a breeze. - Integrated full text search. - A POS mode useful for touchscreen applications, while still having all flexibility of OpenERP available. [4] You can see some old screenshots here [5] and some more up to date information in our blog [6]. I must admit that it seems hard we can find points in common with other kde finance applications due to the fact that Koo uses a three-tier architecture and Python instead of C++, but for example, one of the things we're missing is an intuitive and powerful Charts API. We started using matplotlib, then created our own, and we're considering matplotlib again, but it's terrible API makes the decision pretty hard. We also had to implement a minimal calendar view, which really lacks behind GTK and Web based clients and it's something that would be nice KDE provided. Well, by now I'll be right here watching progress of kde-finance project, and I hope we can help with some stuff in the future!

Of importance, the specific attributes of this group prototype can serve two functions. The first is to enhance perceived intragroup similarity if attributes of prototypes are common with other members, while the second is maximizing intergroup differences if attributes are more extreme. This study tested how different identity prototypes relate to the way individual members perceive the cohesiveness of the group. Team sport athletes (n = 102) were asked to think about the group member who best embodied the team (i.e., group prototype) and report the degree to which the member had qualities that were common/similar (commonalities) or extreme/superior (differences) to other team members. The individual attraction to the team (task and social) dimensions of group cohesion also were assessed. Results of a canonical correlation model, Wilks' ? = .82, F (4, 194) = 5.20, p = .001, indicated a significant amount of overlap in the variability of the prototype and cohesion variable sets accounting for 18% of the variance. When a group prototype was assessed as being common/similar to teammates, individual attraction to the group across task and social dimensions were higher. These findings provide preliminary evidence of a link between group prototype and team cohesion in sport and suggests that when the prototype features commonalities rather than differences between sport team members, task and social cohesion perceptions are higher.\nAcknowledgments: Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada Doctoral Scholarship to the first author (752-2014-2655)", "Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) is known to be a powerful tool for diagnosing and managing hypertension. This is because the data collected through ABP monitors like SunTech's Oscar 2, provide a clear view of the variability of a patient's BP as well as a means to determine their average BP levels. With this information clinicians can better determine if treatment is necessary and also the potential risk for future cardiovascular disease.\nHowever, a recent clinical study used the SunTech Oscar 2 to examine a new potential application for ABPM by utilizing 24-hour average BP to monitor the progression of cerebrovascular disease in an elderly population. This study specifically sought to assess the relationship between ABPM and clinic BP, the progression of white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and functional capabilities in men and women between the ages of 75 and 89. The researchers concluded that \"ambulatory systolic BP but not clinic systolic BP is associated with microvascular brain disease, characterized by volumetric MRI-derived white matter lesions on volume, and is significantly associated with impairment of several measures of mobility and cognition.\" The researchers also hypothesized that mean 24-hour systolic BP might be a potential target for intervention in the elderly which may reduce the progression of microvascular disease and favorably affect function. More research is needed to determine if this suggested treatment would be effective, but it is clear that ABPM is a tool clinicians can depend on to both define patient BP levels and determine treatment options.\nWhite, W.

Pavkovic was indicted in 2003 for planning and ordering the killing and expulsion of thousands of Kosovo Albanian civilians in 1999 while battling ethnic Albanian separatist fighters. He is the 12th Serb indicted to surrender to The Hague this year. \"Kosovo Albanians were frequently intimidated, assaulted or killed in public view to enforce the departure of their families and neighbours,\" his indictment reads. Charges Pavkovic faces four counts of crimes against humanity and one count of violations of the laws or customs of war, including deportation, murder and persecution. In Serbia, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said his surrender meant the former Yugoslav republic had \"stepped closer to the European family of the states\". Pavkovic at first said he would rather kill himself than go to The Hague. He later changed his mind, saying he did not want to be \"the only obstacle to the country's aspirations towards a better future\". Belgrade praised his decision to surrender as a \"highly moral, responsible and patriotic act\" last week. Nine Serbs or Bosnian Serbs indicted by the court are still at large. SOURCE: Agencies", "Chapter 11 looked in detail at TKIP, one of the options for implementing encryption and message authentication under RSN. TKIP, which is mandatory to implement for WPA, will be widely used for Wi-Fi LAN security due to its ability to be used on older WEP cards. However, it is not the default mode for IEEE 802.11i. The default mode is based on a block ciphersuite called the Advanced Encryption Standard or AES. AES-based security can generally be considered as stronger than TKIP-based security. This is not to say that TKIP is inadequate. In reality, TKIP is extremely strong and quite suitable for commercial applications. So why was an AES-based solution defined? And what does it mean to say that it is more secure? The answers to these questions and a detailed look at how AES?CCMP works are provided in this chapter.\nFirst, let's clarify what we mean when we talk about RSN using AES. AES is not a security protocol; it is a block cipher. In RSN the security protocol built around AES is called Counter Mode?CBC MAC Protocol, or CCMP. CCMP defines a set of rules that use the AES block cipher to enable the encryption and protection of IEEE 802.11 frames of data. AES is to CCMP what RC4 is to TKIP.\nOne reason that CCMP is considered stronger than TKIP is that it was designed from the ground up to provide security for IEEE 802.11. The designers took a clean sheet of paper and created CCMP using the best-known techniques. By contrast, TKIP is a compromise, designed to accommodate existing WEP hardware and some aspects of TKIP, notably the Michael integrity protocol, are known to be vulnerable.", "* your Kansas City electrician to call for electrical safety inspections. Many Kansas City homeowners are living with outdated and potentially dangerous electrical features in their homes. We upgrade homes every day that are outdated, underpowered, and overtaxed when it comes to electrical power. Here are some of the most common safety issues we see in homes:\nOne of the most common updates is a service panel upgrade for Kansas City homes. Today\u2019s homes typically have a large-screen TV, several computers, a gaming console, and sound system all in the same room, operating off the same circuit. Not only does this create a fire hazard for homes with older wiring, the panel box is not designed to provide that much power. With today\u2019s modern appliances and electronics, if your home is more than 30 years old, you need an electrical company to assess your home\u2019s system and upgrade it. The service panel or fuse box is the home\u2019s main electrical supply and upgrading the box adds more power to your home. We can also identify old wiring that can be a fire hazard and replace it.

However, the law also says that it is not mandatory for the trustee to ask to be released from his obligation if the split of share is necessarily required by the trust specified.\nHow it came into being\nThis whole law and code were solidified after the Bellows vs. Bellows case. Beverly Bellows had two sons \u2013 Fred and Donald \u2013 whom he named in his trust to be the holders of his asset after his death. Fred was to be the sole trustee and the remaining assets where to be distributed equally between the both while Donald gets his share as part of a special needs trust. Post their father\u2019s death, Donald filed for his stock to be given to him. Soon after, getting paid his share, Donald\u2019s attorney refused to accept the payment and sent a note accusing Fred and his attorney of \u201cillegally using the trust\u2019s money to pay off his attorney.\u201d Despite being explained why the use of the trust\u2019s money was proper, Fred\u2019s attorney eventually ended up paying the remaining amount. When asked for a receipt to end his liability (once Donald cashed the cheque), after legal consent, but instead got a legal notice from Donald stating that he wanted a complete accounting including the sufficient statements which showed all the transactions after the death of Beverly Bellows, their father. When contested, the court stood by Donald, saying a trustee cannot condition the payment with the acceptance of a receipt and that the distribution was to be made with no strings attached. Furthermore, a trustee should always, upon accepting the trust, fill for a court accounting to try and avoid any such issues.", "Pictured are the summer 2022 Imagine volunteer trainees.

Homebodies like myself love a weekend with an excuse to stay home and nest, rest, organize and catch up on television. The rain didn\u2019t stop our crew from hunting eggs (Britton opted out since she weighed the cost of running around the front yard with a basket\u2013 versus the potential benefit of a \u2018golden egg.\u2019) Hence, The Littles ran around like crazy people in between the showers. This was our first Easter (and hunt) in the new house. During the move, either my Easter decor wasn\u2019t holding up after many years or\u2026 I got tired of looking at it for many years because all I could find was a ceramic egg and glittery, pathetic bunny. So not a whole lot of decorating going on at twelve fifty nine. And I\u2019m okay with that. Easter simply isn\u2019t Easter without worship so we got dressed up, grabbed umbrellas and drove ,wind shield wipers swaying, downtown to church followed by a yummy shrimp luncheon at Sassy & Pops. Come to think of, Sassy & Pops would make a great name for a cute restaurant. Luckily Raynes\u2019 PreK egg hunt was earlier in the week several hours before our monsoon hit. The rain, the water it\u2019s all very fitting actually. A clean slate. The tomb is empty. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said.

This will only be my second all grain (and will be a small batch BIAB) and fourth overall, so I'm a baby brewer. I've done a bit (lot) of reading and posts from 8-10 years ago go through the decoction theory, but then effectively say, that with modern malts, or by replacing a percentage with melanoidin malt, you can by pass the decoction. Then some seem to go on about step mashing. I'm getting my nickers in a twist about all this. If I'm honest, I don't think I want the faff of a decoction, especially since the need seems not to be there anymore. So a couple of questions to you please: At the very worst, if I just did a \"standard\" one step, one temperature, single infusion mash - would it make good / great beer? If I do a standard mash, what should the temp be? A stepped mash doesn't sound too difficult, but there are a couple of different techniques. Is there a simple one to follow e.g. the method described in James Morton's book seems pretty straight forward (40-50-60-70) but doesn't supply times for raising the temp and time to hold at each temp.

Near the end of 2016, the PRCB Task Force recommended to the Provincial Council that the centers implement Policy Governance, and the recommendation was approved. The position of Policy Governance Coordinator was created to serve as a resource person for the retreat centers. Our retreatants are probably more interested in what our ministries are accomplishing than what process or model the board is using, but it is a topic of critical importance to the future viability of the retreat centers. Policy Governance can be explained as a system for governance in which all the most important values of the organization are written in policy and that policy is the way the board guides the Retreat Center Director (CEO) in running the center and holds the CEO accountable for organizational performance. Policy Governance boards govern in a way that allows the board to focus more on the long-term direction of the retreat center while carefully delegating most day-to-day decisions to the CEO. This site is intended to provide Policy Governance resources your board will require as it navigates governing the retreat center into the future.

Not much of a surprise the 1988 defense was No. 1 on the list, holding their opponent to nearly 1/3 less than what they normally averaged. The 2015 defense finished at No. 21 on the list and the highest over the past 7-years. Combine the 2015 Auburn defense and the 2014 Auburn offense and you likely have another SEC title and a finish in the Final-Four. You cannot make a fair comparison of simply looking at the season averages, especially when you compare a defense from 2010 to 1988. This is why I like to compare the percentage of yards surrendered compared to what the opponent normally allows. There were fewer 400-yard offensive games during the 1980's compared to this current decade. During the 1992 season, 18 teams had a defense that surrendered less than 300-yards per game. This season there were only five. On the offensive side of the football there were 29 teams at the FBS level that averaged over 400-yards per game. During this past season there were 64 teams. In terms of improvement, during Auburn's first 6 games against FBS competition, the opponent gained 2.2% more yardage than they normally averaged. During the last 6 games of the season, Auburn held their opponent to -35.0% below their opponent's season average. Hopefully Kevin Steele's 2016 Auburn defense can pick up from where Muschamp's defense left off in 2015.

In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we evaluated the efficacy and feasibility of S(+)-ketamine as an adjunctive analgesic after cardiac surgery. Ninety patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were randomized to receive either a 75 \u00b5g/kg bolus of S(+)-ketamine followed by a continuous infusion of 1.25 \u00b5g \u00b7 kg1 \u00b7 min1 for 48 h (n = 44) or placebo (normal saline bolus and infusion) (n = 46). From the time of tracheal extubation, patients could access an opioid (oxycodone) via a patient-controlled analgesia device, and the cumulative oxycodone doses were measured over 48 h. Pain was evaluated on a visual analog scale three times daily. The quality of recovery, patient satisfaction with pain management, and adverse effects were recorded. The cumulative oxycodone consumption during the first 48 postoperative hours was less in the S(+)-ketamine group (103 \u00b1 44 mg) than in the placebo group (125 \u00b1 45 mg; mean difference, 22 mg; 95% confidence interval for the difference, 340 mg; P = 0.023). Pain scores did not differ between the groups at rest (P = 0.17) or during a deep breath (P = 0.23). Patient satisfaction was superior in S(+)-ketamine-treated patients: 26 (60%) of 44 in the S(+)-ketamine group compared with 16 (35%) of 46 in the placebo group were very satisfied with the analgesic management (P = 0.032). Nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events, with similar frequencies in both groups. Four patients in the S(+)-ketamine group developed transient hallucinations during the infusion, versus none in the placebo group. In conclusion, small-dose S(+)-ketamine decreased opioid consumption in CABG patients during the first 48 h after surgery..\nThis article has been cited by other articles:", "While internet dating has the share of cons, it might be an excellent application for getting together with new people and developing a much lower connection.

However, about one-third of such patients develop disease recurrence and die within 5 years after complete resection. The ability to predict recurrence could represent an important contribution to treatment planning. This study evaluates the presence of telomerase activity in tumor cells as a predictor of disease recurrence and cancer-related death after operation for stage I NSCLC patients. The activity of the telomerase enzyme was investigated by telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) in tumors and matching normal lung tissue samples obtained from 107 consecutive operable patients with pathological stage I NSCLC. Telomerase activity was detected in 66 (62%) of the 107 tumors examined and in none of the corresponding adjacent noncancerous lung tissue samples. Correlation with pathological parameters showed that telomerase activity was associated with histopathological grade (P = 0.0135) but not with tumor size or histological type. Univariate survival curves, estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier, defined a significant association between telomerase activity and both disease-free survival (P = 0.0115) and overall survival (P = 0.0129). In multivariate analyses, performed by Cox's proportional hazards regression models, the presence of telomerase activity was the only strong predictor of disease-free survival (P = 0.0173) and overall survival (P = 0.0187). Our data indicate that telomerase activity can be an important prognostic factor that should be considered in future prospective trials of adjuvant therapy for high-risk stage I NSCLC patients.", "Organizations with a significant amount of customized learning needs should\nIf you have content that is applicable to more than one course, RLOs can simplify course development and streamline course maintenance.

I have gone through many tubs but this time SA gave me their pistachio mask to try out. This is basically a skin hydrating & firming mask meant for dehydrated aging skin without any tall claims of whitening or brightening. The mask comes in signature Biotique green tub and you do need to dig in your fingers or use a spatula to take out the product. The mask itself is mint green in color with a nice creamy consistency easily spreading on the skin. It gives a slight tingling sensation in the beginning but settles down soon without any issues. Also the skin feel little warmed up once you put this on. So sensitive skin females might want to check before using this. It never dries up & can be easily removed with the help of a moist cotton pad. I feel this is the best hydration mask I have used after Elizabeth Arden\u2019s 8 hours moisturizing cream. The skin feel super soft & supple with a nice fresh feel. As claimed it does firms the skin which I could see. In short this does everything that it claims! I would highly recommend this for dry skin females when you need that extra boost of hydration for your dull & lifeless skin. Highly recommended.\nI have used many tubs of Biotique\u2019s fruit face pack and love it a lot.

Sensitivity analyses were performed by repeating the original meta-analyses with exclusion of the lowest-weighted or lowest-scored study. Thirteen retrospective studies including 2906 patients (PN: 1172; RN: 1734) were included in our analyses. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) of overall survival (OS) indicated significant differences between the PN and RN groups (HR: 0.76; p = 0.001), although no significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of cancer-specific survival (CSS; HR: 0.91; p = 0.51). The pooled eGFR decrease was significantly lower in the PN group than that in the RN group (mean difference (MD): 11.59; p < 0.001). PN was associated with longer operative time and more estimated blood loss (MD: 65.33 min, p < 0.001 and MD: 97.83 ml, p < 0.001, respectively). Pooled odds ratios (ORs) revealed that, compared with RN, PN is associated with a significantly higher risk of low-grade and high-grade (OR: 1.59, p = 0.01 and OR: 7.35, p < 0.001, respectively) surgical complications. No statistical significances were changed in sensitivity analyses on all outcome variables, except for that on the low-grade complication when excluding the lowest-scored study. All results were pooled using the fixed-effects model due to the nil or low heterogeneity. No obvious publication bias was screened about reporting OS. In conclusion, while PN for large (\u22657 cm) renal tumors is associated with better OS compared with RN, these methods show a similar CSS. However, the advantages of PN, a more involved procedure than RN, in preserving renal function are accompanied by a higher risk of surgical complications. Large-sample and well-designed randomized controlled trials with extensive follow up are needed to confirm and update our conclusions.\nKeywords: Meta-analysis; Partial nephrectomy; Radical nephrectomy; Renal function; Renal tumor.", "Even Visa thinks the World Cup is a mess by Daniel Roberts @FortuneMagazine May 20, 2015, 12:10 PM EDT E-mail Tweet Facebook Google Plus Linkedin Share icons Visa expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d Wednesday about the worker conditions in Qatar ahead of the 2022 World Cup, becoming the first major American sponsor to speak out about reports of worker deaths at construction sites. \u201cWe continue to be troubled by the reports coming out of Qatar related to the World Cup and migrant worker conditions,\u201d Visa said. \u201cWe have expressed our grave concern to FIFA and urge them to take all necessary actions to work with the appropriate authorities and organizations to remedy this situation and ensure the health and safety of all involved.\u201d The Gulf nation is urgently preparing to host the 2022 World Cup amid searing heat and accusations of bribery.

There are small variations in pattern with each slab but the shade and colour is usually consistent. Bethel White is one of the lighter granites available and is a very popular choice for modern contemporary kitchens. However it is also suited to more traditional kitchens too; the beauty of Bethel White is that its light colouring will blend well with almost any coloured kitchen cabinetry. The pattern and unusual presence of black flecks give Bethel White granite a very unique and distinctive look. Bethel White originates from India where many unique granites are mined. Due to its pale colours, Bethel White is not as durable as darker granites and so more care must be taken in its preservation. Care should be taken to ensure that it is not exposed to excessive heat, cold or moisture. Due to the popularity of Bethel White granite, we have vast experience in fitting this particular granite in a wide range of applications.

The impacts of the ZnO/TiO2 assorted photoelectrode on the photovoltaic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were investigated. The measurements of the light transmission spectra showed the higher transmittance through ZnO/FTO than through FTO during the effective wavelength region of 536nm\u02dc800nm for DSSCs, indicating that ZnO/TiO2 assorted photoelectrode is beneficial for the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. The measurements on the photovoltaic characteristics of the DSSC cell indicate that the inserted ZnO layer can cause the increased open circuit voltage (Voc) more than 70 mV and fill factor (FF) but the decreased short circuit current. The enhanced Voc and FF could be attributed to the suppressed the recombination of photon-generated carriers between the ZnO/TiO2 assorted photoelectrode and electrolyte (dye) compared to TiO2 photoelectrode. However, the additional series resistance of inserted ZnO layer causes the reduced short circuit current. The optimized conversion efficiency can be achieved in the DSSC with ZnO/TiO2 assorted photoelectrode by using low series resistance of ZnO layer.\nEmail your librarian or administrator to recommend adding this to your organisation's collection.", "Tidal Wave - by Dammien Alexander by UndergroundSun published on 2017-02-07T23:44:49Z Follow Dammien Alexander Facebook: Instagram: Follow UndergroundSun Facebook: Twitter: Instagram: LYRICS: Folded all hope for love it burns internal Cause I subtracted my actions after The elephant in the room trampled my satisfaction When I\u2019m with you, I see the colour blue You tell lies so beautiful beautiful You tell lies so beautiful yeah yeah yeah You don\u2019t have to front bey bey baby You know what you want and it\u2019s not me Your emotions aren\u2019t logical It\u2019s like swimming in a Tidal Wave Hold up Hold Up I mix the hash with the purple And my relaxed non-reaction to The elephant in the room And who the hell you\u2019ve been texting When I\u2019m with you, I see the colour blue You tell lies so beautiful beautiful You tell lies so beautiful yeah yeah yeah Uh!

However there are also those who are mostly interested in getting an easy to use mouse without all the bells and whistles offered by the gaming variants and of course at a fraction of the price. ROCCAT is well aware of that and so aside their impressive KONE line of gaming mice they have just released the rather entry-level LUA Tri-Button gaming mouse which we've been testing for the past week. ROCCAT LUA wears an 2000DPI Pro Optic (R2) Optical Sensor under the hood which can reach a maximum speed of 60ips with 20Gs of acceleration so if you're an avid gamer and are looking to purchase a very good gaming mouse to play fast passed FPS titles then you will most likely be disappointed by the specifications of the LUA. Of course that's really fine and expected since ROCCAT didn't actually design it with serious gamers in mind, for those they have the KONE line which surpasses the LUA with ease in most aspects. What the KONE line doesn't have however is an equally small size and an ambidextrous design and those two are perhaps the strong points of the LUA Tri-Button gaming mouse. So follow us to see exactly what the new LUA is all about and whether or not it stands a chance against the competition.", "Obviously, you bought your J10 because you knew that you wanted dependability and long-lasting service both rolled up into one vehicle.

The most important church in Montevarchi is Saint Lawrence Collegiate, located in Varchi Square. Parts of the church were built all the way back in the 13th century, but it wasn\u2019t until 1561 that Pope Pius IV appointed a magistrate to the church. Later, in 1709, the church was remodeled from its original Romanesque style to reflect a more Baroque style.\nMontevarchi is also home to several different places of interest, such as museums and libraries. One such place is a library, called The Library of the Academy. Its crown jewel is a copy of \u201cThe Decameron\u201d, a medieval allegory from the 14th century written by Giovanni Boccaccio. The library also holds over 20,000 other books, manuscripts, and more. For art lovers looking for a great museum in Montevarchi, there\u2019s a unique museum that opened in 2001 to honor the work of Ernesto Galeffi. Simply called the Ernesto Galeffi Museum, it contains more than 2,000 of his drawings, as well as ten of his paintings and sixty of his sculptures.\nMontevarchi is a popular place for day trips from Florence, as it is less than an hour away by car and train.

Locally advanced or metastatic PDAC remains a major clinical challenge, and the prognosis of affected patients is dismal despite substantial research efforts in this area. Recent large-scale genomic analyses of PDAC revealed that KRAS is the most frequently mutated driver gene in this entity. In addition, a relatively large proportion of PDAC patients displays germline variants in genes involved in DNA repair, particularly DNA double-strand repair. Similarly, a sizable fraction of sporadic PDAC cases harbor mutations in genome maintenance genes, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM. While direct targeting of oncogenic KRAS is currently not possible in the clinical setting, these defects in DNA repair may open new therapeutic avenues. Here, we discuss the potential use of compounds that interfere with DNA repair and genome maintenance mechanisms for the treatment of PDAC. We particularly focus on the genotype-tailored use of compounds, such as PARP inhibitors, as well as ATR- and DNA-protein kinase catalytic subunit (PKcs) inhibitors.", "Arts & Culture Stories on Stage - Very Short Stories: International | Apr 8 By Thad Pyzdrowski \u2022 Mar 20, 2017 storiesonstage.org Buntport Theater returns with Flash Fiction from around the world.

One bank has set up a popular \"cyber branch\" in the tiny Dokdo islands -- called Takeshima in Japanese -- which lie about halfway across the sea to Japan. Mobile phone companies have joined in. Some have ringtones based on a song eulogising South Korean rule over the islands. And one is offering a \"Dokdo is our territory\" call plan that lets subscribers donate to a campaign to promote the islands internationally as South Korean territory. And clothing companies are busy pushing a range of T-shirts on the theme, with slogans such as \"I love Dokdo.\" One daily showed a photograph of an official handing out badges to travellers at the country's main international airport with the slogan :\"Dokdo is Korean territory!!\". The latest furore erupted in July after Japan, Korea's colonial ruler from 1910-45, advised schools to teach that the islands were Japanese. Both countries say their claims go back centuries though the diplomatic squabble has looked more intense after it was realised that the cluster of rocks might sit above valuable gas deposits. Local media reported that some of the products on sale are leftover stock from the last patriotic flurry over the islands in 2005. \"It's natural that companies are grabbing the chance to take advantage ... when the patriotic sentiment is at its peak,\" said Kim Rando, a consumer studies professor at Seoul National University. \"But this marketing strategy that appeals only to patriotism could give rise to excessive nationalism,\" he added.

More than one tenth of non-food firms have innovative human resources systems, with much individual and group involvement in decision-making and financial returns, but only a minuscule proportion of food firms have such systems. At the other end of the spectrum, more than one-fifth of food stores and eating and drinking places (and nearly one-third of food wholesale firms) have traditional systems, as compared to only one-tenth of non-food firms. The tasks and the human resource practices typical of retail food firms are consistent with each other. Core employees in these firms perform tasks that are generally simpler and less variable than those in other industries, and the firms' human resource practices generally give workers less autonomy and incentives than those in other industries. Whether the structure and variability of tasks are the result of a particular business strategy or adoption of a certain technology is not known. Which came first, these simple tasks, the workers who perform them, or these human resource policies is similarly unknown. We arrive at these conclusions through analysis of an original data set composed of 806 Minnesota firms, including 211 food firms, which allows us to characterize the change in human resource practices since the early 1980s, and to examine differences in the organization of work across companies.

My old family decided I needed more attention than what they could give me. I was rescued by GRRIN and went to live with some of the greatest foster parents! I became good buddies with their other dog, Buster. It was sad to leave my foster parents but GRRIN found me a new family that I love so much! My new family is Chris and Nikki. They are getting married this summer! I live in a nice home with a big backyard! I love to go exploring around the yard! I also love to play in the snow (and eat it too)! Nikki takes me for walks around our neighborhood. Since I come from the farm, I have to get use to all the sites and sounds of living in the city. They all said I needed some work when walking with the leash. I think I\u2019m getting the hang of it! Chris is teaching me to \u201cshake\u201d and play catch with the Frisbee. I can\u2019t wait for spring to finally come so I can go along when he goes fishing! I\u2019ve also been able to make some new buddies! Chris\u2019 parents have a Golden named Jake and a Goldendoodle named Ruby. I have so much fun when I hang out with them! I look forward to making more friends when Nikki and her friends have doggie play dates when the weather gets nicer! I\u2019m loving life at my new home!

The downside of EC's science courses (A&P and Micro) is that they are lacking in labs, so some schools won't accept them for transfer credits later if you want to further your education. Good luck, whatever you decide!Dec 7, '11 by JENNIFER27Ok thanks for that information also. I didn't know EC sciences didn't include a lab. I only need information literacy and Micro for my core classes and I signed up for information literacy through Penn Foster. I will check out those other sites you gave me today. I'm scheduled for Health Safety next week, so I've been studying. Hope to complete information literacy this month also.

According to their story, studios are looking for this type of movie and Emmerich has a good track record putting together a project with a script, a budget and plans to direct that have gotten studios like 20th Century Fox, Sony and Warner Bros. to pay big money up front to make them happen. They also say that Emmerich is still working on develping Singularity and an adaptation of Isaac Asimov\u2019s sci-fi classic Foundation which he\u2019s had on his plate going back before 2012, so there\u2019s a chance that he can go back to one of them before tackling Emergence, which will be produced by Kirstin Winkler, Centropolis Executive Vice President of Production, and Aaron Boyd, the companys Director of Development.Kelman, meanwhile, is writing Outpost for Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Paramount Pictures.(Photo by Vera Anderson/WireImage) SHARE TWEET Show CommentsPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "A great 12 month fixed term contract in now available within a famous FTSE 100 financial services business for a Senior Reward Manager.

My order of over $300 had a nominal standard shipping rate of $29.99. They were willing to waive this ridiculous shipping rate because my order was over $75, but in order to get the free shipping, I had to enter a discount code. The problem is that this prevents entering any other discount code. I had a $40 discount code from Mr. Rebates, but I could only use one discount code or the other. Online help confirmed that only one discount code could be used at a time.On the face of it, this sounds somewhat reasonable, but let\u2019s think about it. Why do I need to enter a code to get the free shipping they offer themselves? The answer is that this specifically neutralizes all the other discount offers they float on different websites. Then they charge unreasonable shipping rates, so that these other discount codes essentially just barely cover the shipping. Result: either you get the artificially inflated shipping free, or you get a discount which is eaten up by the inflated shipping.Either way, it\u2019s basically a con game, with no real significant reduction in total priceavailable.I ended up buying the same items at another site for $40 less AND free shipping (on all orders over $75) Furthermore, this site\u2019s standard shipping for orders that didn\u2019t qualify for free shipping was $6.99!I recommend avoiding JC Whitney and their fake free shipping.:55 am, November 15, 2020 (CST) and is a permanent record located at:.\nThe reviews & complaints posted about Carparts - JC Whitparts - JC Whitney as per Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.", "Hi all, so setup is: menu 3.4 HBC (IOS36 v12.18, not sure if that matters) I installed IOS16-64-v257.wad and 07-cIOS249-v7_waninkokoFULL-nw7.wad to be able to use the gamma launcher, and i'v now upgraded to rev8 and the error 002 fix launcher.

I'm not sure if I want to downgrade just for this one option as I seem to be able to do everything else. Any comments are appreciated.

In reality, that was three and a half months and 12,000 kilometres ago. I've been to the far corners of Saskatchewan, and I'm telling you, there is no place like it! I've learnt that Saskatchewan is jam-packed with parks, festivals, activities and places that are just waiting to be discovered. If you don't believe me, watch this video: I hope I've inspired you to get out and explore this amazing province for yourself. I want to thank Bennett Dunlop Ford for providing me with not one, but three brand-new Ford vehicles. These vehicles did more than just get me from A to B, they allowed me to ride in comfort and style throughout all 12,000 kilometres of my journey. I would like to thank CAA's generous donation of gas cards which allowed me to reach 12,000 kilometres. I had quite a few jealous looks inside the Husky stations when I whipped out gift certificates rather than a visa to fill up. I would also like to thank the Ministry of Parks, Culture and Sport, including Minister Doherty, Chelsea Coupal and Jennifer Johnson for giving me this amazing opportunity to explore my home province. It\u2019s been a one-of-a-kind experience that I wouldn't trade for anything! Lastly I would like to thank all of the incredible people I've met along my summer travels.

EU\u201127 emissions were 15.5 % below the 1990 level. This 2010 increase follows a 7 % drop in 2009 (compared to 2008), largely due to the economic recession and the growth of renewable energy generation. Between 1990 and 2010, greenhouse gas emissions in the EU-27 decreased in all main emitting sectors except in the transport sector, where they increased considerably. In the EU-15, CO2 emissions from public electricity and heat production also increased.\nIn the EU-15, estimated 2010 GHG emissions increased by 2.3 % (+/\u2013 0.7) compared to 2009. This implies that EU\u201115 greenhouse gas emissions were approximately 10.6 % below the 1990 level in 2010 (1) or 10.7 % below the base-year level. The European Union remains well on track to achieve its Kyoto Protocol target (an 8% reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions compared to base-year level, to be achieved during the period from 2008 to 2012). 2010 emissions of all EU-12 Member States that have a Kyoto target were well below their Kyoto target, except in Slovenia.\nA detailed assessment of progress towards Kyoto targets and 2020 targets in Europe is provided in EEA's 2011 report on Greenhouse gas emission trends and projections.]]>", "The ray casting operation quickly becomes a bottleneck. For a 1080p image at 90Hz, it would need to be performed over\nmillion times per second, and the ray-triangle intersection test would be performed for every triangle (although data structures such as a BSP would quickly eliminate many from consideration). In most common cases, it is much more efficient to switch from such image-order rendering to object-order rendering. The objects in our case are triangles and the resulting process is called rasterization, which is the main function of modern graphical processing units (GPUs). In this case, an image is rendered by iterating over every triangle and attempting to color the pixels where the triangle lands on the image. The main problem is that the method must solve the unavoidable problem of determining which part, if any, of the triangle is the closest to the focal point (roughly, the location of the virtual eye).\nOne way to solve it is to sort the triangles in depth order so that the closest triangle is last. This enables the triangles to be drawn on the screen in back-to-front order. If they are properly sorted, then any later triangle to be rendered will rightfully clobber the image of previously rendered triangles at the same pixels. The triangles can be drawn one-by-one while totally neglecting the problem of determining which is nearest. This is known as the Painter's algorithm. The main flaw, however, is the potential existence of depth cycles, shown in Figure 7.6, in which three or more triangles cannot be rendered correctly in any order by the Painter's algorithm. One possible fix is to detect such cases and split the triangles.", "/* Declarations for getopt.

During the three-week Formal Marksmanship Training Course, Marines learn a variety of skills, such as shooting positions, types of slings and how to coach other Marines.The Marines must have a high marksmanship score on the range before they can qualify for the coaches\u2019 course. After completion, the new coaches return to their units to make better riflemen, according to Sgt. Jerome E. Hutcheson, a 29-year-old FMTC instructor from Fort.

Daniel Moore, a 22-year-old FMTC student from Monticello, Ark .Every Marine qualifies on the range once a year to make sure they are capable of accurately firing a weapon while using the proper techniques and safety measures.\u201cEvery marine is a rifleman, therefore if we have qualified instructors coaching Marines to become better rifleman, the Marine Corps is a better place to be in than any other place in the world,\u201d said Hutcheson.", "From the time you wake up tomorrow morning until the time you get to sleep, you will see somewhere in the range of 8,000 advertisements.

I am cruising the Silhouette next April with my 10 and 12 year old daughters. This will be there 7th cruise and our first on Celebrity. This qualifies them for the $10 pricing for specialty dining. We would like to buy a three day package and adult pricing is $129 for three days. It would obviously be $30 for the kids. When pre-booking on the website why on Earth are the kids charged $129 as well? It says they will be discounted on the ship in the form of OBC. This is a ridiculous policy and is there anything anywhere else in the cruise industry that works like this? How can you simply not just charge them the $30 as they have their ages listed when booking the package? Celebrity is essentially charging us an extra $100 cash each per kid and turning it into unwanted OBC. It's stupid ..... I know this is a rant but does it not seem outrageous? Imagine if they charged all of you, let's say, $229 for a three day package and they'll give you $100 back in OBC once you board? Laughable right? This must be Celebrity's real way of discouraging parents of children from booking specialty dining. I won't book because of this and i'm sure those who dislike kids may think it's a good idea, but come on. I wish Lisa from Celebrity would actually read and comment on this dumb practice.

The IOP starts to increase at an age of about 6 months as a result of morphological changes within the anterior eye segment, e.g., pigment dispersion and iris synechiae. The purpose of the present study was to investigate how ERG responses change in individuals at different ages in D2J mice and to compare these changes with normal aging effects in pigmented C57/B6 (B6) mice. IOP was measured in awake, non-sedated D2J and B6 mice with a rebound tonometer. At ages between 2-3 and 10 months, scotopic flash ERGs were measured five times with about 2 months' intervals. In addition, light adapted flicker ERGs were recorded. Our data show that the D2J shows lower flicker ERG responses than the B6 mice already at an age of 2-3 months. Dark adapted flash ERG responses are not decreased at this age. In both mouse strains the ERG responses decrease as a function of age, but there is a stronger decrease in the D2J mice. The data of flicker ERGs suggest the presence of early functional deficits in the D2J retina that possibly have a post-receptoral origin. The scotopic flash ERG reveals a functional deficit that occurs at a later stage and that possibly is IOP dependent. But, the deficits appear at an age at which the IOP is still lower than in the B6 mouse, indicating that other factors play an additional role. \u00a9 2009 Springer-Verlag.", "\u201cHealing the Stories We Tell Ourselves with Mother Turtle\u201d is a unique interactive personal enrichment experience that helps you to uncover, shift, and let go of the toxic stories that you are carrying about yourself and others.

Twelve New Zealand rabbits that were seronegative for BHV-5 were used for virus inoculation, and five rabbits were used as mock-infected controls. The rabbits were kept in separate areas and were inoculated intranasally with 500 \u03bcl of virus suspension (EVI 88 Brazilian isolate) into each nostril (virus titer, 10(7.5) TCID50). Control rabbits were inoculated with the same volume of minimum essential medium. Five days before virus inoculation, the rabbits were submitted to daily administration of dexamethasone. After virus inoculation, the rabbits were monitored clinically on a daily basis. Seven rabbits showed respiratory symptoms and four animals exhibited neurological symptoms. Tissue sections were collected for histological examination and immunohistochemistry to examine BHV-5 antigens, astrocytes, T and B lymphocytes and MMP-9. By means of immunohistochemical and PCR methods, BHV-5 was detected in the entire brain of the animals which presented with neurological symptoms, especially in the trigeminal ganglion and cerebral cortices. Furthermore, BHV-5 antigens were detected in neurons and/or other non-neural cells. In addition to the neurons, most infiltrating CD3 T lymphocytes observed in these areas were positive for MMP-9 and also for BHV-5 antigen. These infected cells might contribute to the spread of the virus to the rabbit brain along the trigeminal ganglia and olfactory nerve pathways.", "Nicholas Johnson\nThe Daily Iowan, May 6, 2016, p. 4, such as the British House of Commons Question Time, or President Obama\u2019s \u201cWe the People Petitions.\u201d That would be like Rastetter running naked from a Finnish sauna and jumping into a frigid snow bank.

In summary, both Putin and Rastetter take questions from constituents. But there the similarity ends. Putin takes the questions of greatest concern to Russians and answers or otherwise responds to them. Iowans get no responses; it\u2019s not clear the regents even watch their video comments. Putin gave the exchange nearly four hours, on nationwide television, during convenient times for viewers, in which he was an active participant. Rastetter devotes one hour, during times least likely to encourage participation, in which no regent participates. Putin receives 3 million questions from 143 million people.

I've got a Samsung N120 netbook with XP home preinstalled on first partition so I decided to test Win7 on second partition. This RTM Ultimate is pre-activated and has 7Loader integrated. Some two weeks ago I installed this RTM using USB method and everything was fine. Before installing, I made a Acronis back-up including boot sector. 7Loader started at final install, in properties of my computer it looked like Win7 was activated. Now, 3 days ago I upgraded my N120 with the latest BIOS and now I see Win7 has two days left until automatic activation. If I press 'activate now' I get message that 'product key is not valid for activation'. Upon this, I booted into XP on first partition, deleted the Win7 partition and formated this partition again. After that I used Acronis and restored my XP partition including boot track and also 'digital signature'. Then I installed Win7 again on second partition using the same USB method and now (yesterday) I saw that I have three days left before automatic activation. Today there is two days left. As a desperate manouver I tried Hazars 7Loader 2 v1.5 as suggested, no difference. I tried also Daz Windows 7 Loader but no success. As I understand there is no possibility to use SLIC 2.1 method as there is no SLIC available for Samsung N120 Netbook. Anyone here on this forum who can help me out? Was it my mistake to upgrade the BIOS? Any way to get my Win7 activated before time is out (2 days left)? Thanks very much for some help.

Not only are they made with repurposed wine bottles, but each and every candle they offer is inspired by a different type of wine. How cool is that?!\nTake their Chardonnay candle for example. They describe it as offering \"warm notes of vanilla, butter, and burnt toast\" and advise you to \"look for deep hazelnut and cedar wood undertones\". If that charming description doesn't have you itching to get your hands on one for the fall, I don't know what will! If you want one as much as I do there are a few ways you can get your hands on one. You can either purchase them directly from their site or you can search to find where local retail locations selling them near you. Luckily for me there are a decent amount of retailers selling them in Philadelphia, so I'll definitely be stopping in and giving each and everyone a good sniff before selecting my new candle.

The reserve provides a range of terrain supporting wildlife and some fascinating flora, including seven species of carnivorous plants. These include species of bladderworts (Utricularia) and sundews (Drosera), both of which are considered by conservationists to be endangered and in need of protection.\nThe sundew's name is a reference to the drops of sticky substance, called mucilage, that gather on the tips of its tentacles, resembling drops of dew found on plants in the early morning. It is this sticky substance which enables the sundew to capture the insects they need to survive. Research has shown that carnivorous, or insectivorous, plants lack some of the enzymes present in other plants, and are therefore unable to derive all their nutritional requirements from the soil. Instead, they meet their nutritional needs by digesting insects. The plants use their sweet, sticky secretions to attract and trap insects, and then secrete a range of enzymes to dissolve the insect, with the resultant liquid being absorbed through the surface of its leaves. The sundew's tentacles are exceptionally sensitive to any movement around it, responding in seconds, or even tenths of a second, when touched.\nSundews produce beautiful flowers which grow well clear of its mucilage-tipped tentacles, although it has been determined that sundews do not consume pollinating insects and quite a number of sundew species are self-pollinating. The continued existence of sundews is primarily threatened by habitat destruction. In Puerto Rico, the Tortuguero Lagoon was designated as a nature reserve in December 1979, as authorities acknowledged its importance to the ecology of the region.

Between 28 and 70 days, upper tract infection (inflammation and distension of the uterine horns, occlusion of oviducts with inflammatory exudate, pyosalpinx, and hydrosalpinx) was seen in > 80% of the animals. Mice were dosed orally, commencing at 7 days after infection, with minocycline, doxycycline, or amoxicillin-clavulanate. Further groups received azithromycin either as a single high dose or as lower once-daily doses. In addition, minocycline and amoxicillin-clavulanate were administered at 24 h after infection, and this early treatment prevented elevation of antibody titers whereas delayed therapy did not. Vaginal swabs from mice in all treatment regimens were culture negative except for 25% of mice receiving either early amoxicillin-clavulanate or low-dose azithromycin, which yielded low numbers (20 to 70 inclusion-forming units) of chlamydiae. Numbers of fertile mice in the early treatment regimens and their litter sizes were similar to those of noninfected controls, although 25% of amoxicillin-clavulanate-treated mice had unilateral hydrosalpinges. In comparison, 88% of untreated mice developed hydrosalpinges and only 25% conceived.

We investigated how vessel-induced virtual electrode polarizations assist reentry termination.\nMethods and results: A highly anatomically detailed rabbit ventricular slice bidomain computer model was constructed from 25-\u03bcm magnetic resonance data, faithfully representing both structural and electric properties of blood vessels. For comparison, an equivalent simplified model with intramural cavities filled in was also built. Following fibrillation induction, 6 initial states were selected, and biphasic shocks (5-70 V) were applied using a realistic implanted cardioverter-defibrillator electrode configuration. A fundamental mechanism of biphasic defibrillation was uncovered in both models, involving successive break excitations (after each shock phase) emanating from opposing myocardial surfaces (in septum and left ventricle), which rapidly closed down excitable gaps. The presence of vessels accelerated this process, achieving more-rapid and successful defibrillation. Defibrillation failed in 5 cases (all because of initiation of new activity) compared with 8 with the simplified model (5/8 failures because of surviving activity). At stronger shocks, virtual electrodes formed around vessels, rapidly activating intramural tissue because of break excitations, assisting the main defibrillation mechanism, and eliminating all activity <15 ms of shock end in 60% of successful shocks (36% in simplified model). Subsequent analysis identified that only vessels >200 \u03bcm in diameter participated through this mechanism. Consequently, wavefronts could survive intramurally in the simplified model, leading to reentry and shock failure.\nConclusions: We provide new insight into defibrillation mechanisms by showing how intramural blood vessels facilitate more-effective elimination of existing wavefronts, rapid closing down of excitable gaps, and successful defibrillation and give guidance toward the required resolution of cardiac imaging and model generation endeavors for mechanistic defibrillation analysis.", "Due to oil and gas exploitation, offshore oil and gas platform may experience subsidence. Continuing subsidence may deform the platform infrastructures, adding the risk for any failure on the platform objects. The failure means disaster. Therefore the subsidence information is mandatory for risk assessment and safety requirement. Repeatedly or continuous monitoring of accurate positions on the platform by using global navigation satellite system global positioning system (GNSS GPS) technology may reveal the changing of even small positions which are representing subsidence on the platform. This chapter will be deeply discussed on the use of GNSS GPS technology for offshore oil and gas platform subsidence monitoring, especially in Indonesia, the archipelago country where long baseline between reference station in the land and monitoring station at the sea slightly exists. The capability and especially the high performance of this technology on deriving subsidence information along with data sample of long baseline will be highlighted.\nPart of the book: Multi-purposeful Application of Geospatial Data experiencing land subsidence). These impacts are quite costly. All this is disastrous. In a number of regions of Indonesia, land subsidence and negative impacts in the shape of flooding and tidal inundation clearly exist. In Jakarta and Bandung we can see that the subsiding areas close to rivers frequently suffer from flooding. Tidal inundation is a regular feature at subsiding coastal areas such as Jakarta, Blanakan, Semarang, and Demak. Since these negative impacts are clearly formed a disaster while mitigation and or adaptation is still a big homework, in this case for better adaptation and mitigation in the future, understanding deeply the correlation of land subsidence and flooding is necessary as discused in this chapter. We conclude that the correlation is quite tremendous and indeed producing a disaster.\nPart of the book: Natural Hazards", "Review: Rites of Passage\nThis is just going to be a random spilling of my thoughts instead of the usual well thought-out reviews I normally do.

Paulo Melim Andersson, three seasons into his tenure, offered a collection which will no doubt be quickly dubbed 'eclectic,' a popular fashion euphemism for disjointed and unfocussed. The frankly cretinous programme notes only served to scramble the message even more: the Chlo\u00e9 girl suffers from 'urban ennui', apparently, with an 'aristocratic past and a walk on the wild side present'. How this equates to the clothing shown, I haven't yet figured out. The collection tried to hit every possible trend on the head - masculine tailoring, embellishment, black-is-back ad nauseum - but in its desperate attempts to appear 'branch\u00e9' it came across as stilted as the show music, jumping violently from euro-electronica to plaintive violins with no explanation inbetween. There was an oddly summery feel to the prissy, sprig-print chiffons, chintz and paisleys, perhaps because we saw them done by so many others this spring; likewise the high-necked blouses, dubbed Victoriana, but with definite shades of Prada's 'Sincere Chic'. The oversized, tweedy masculine tailoring was nice (albeit already a clich\u00e9), but as quickly as it appeared it was gone, with no development of aesthetic. It's not that the A/W 2008 Chlo\u00e9 collection was particularly bad, or especially offensive - indeed much of it was very, very good. It's just that throughout one had the feeling that we've seen pretty much everything offered before, and done with more conviction, something we should never feel at a major Paris show. That may seem harsh, but when the only hyperbole a review can possibly muster is 'nice' and 'good' to describe a collection, something has to be awry.\nComment", "Friday, July 14, 2006\nDigital Rice University\nMany of you will have seen the announcement that Rice University is re-launching their Academic Press as an entirely digital publishing operation. One thing they might think about is removing the announcement that they shut it down back in 1996. The recent pr announcement is here. This is an ambitious and in some ways courageous effort. As their Provost points out, very few Academic Press make money and most loose a lot. Often their only function often seems to be the aggrandizement of certain academics. Assuming Rice is able to fulfill their goal of truly looking for new models of scholarship and publication this could become a model for other presses to follow. Certainly some are already going in the e-book direction but what Rice hints at in their announcement is an acknowledgement that academic publishing has been constrained by the physical print product. What is on offer is the capacity to engage the author, other scholars (peers) and students in an active relationship facilitated by the content produced. As Rice University and others experiment we will see less publish and hope than publish and republish and republish (or revise) but probably without the long term publication delays which are common in academic journal publishing. The resulting published products will become interactive with link resolvers interlacing all the supporting content and perhaps data sets supporting the conclusions thereby allowing others to recreate the results. The social aspect will enable feedback on relevancy and ranking.

In 2007, 792 people were killed, taking the death toll in four years of unrest in Thailand's four southernmost provinces to 2,776, Prince of Songkhla University's \"Deep South Watch\" think-tank said. The tally is compiled from media, police and army reports. Victims continued to come from both the Buddhist minority and Muslim majority in the region, a Malay-speaking sultanate annexed by Bangkok a century ago. Rights groups accuse security forces of having a hand in some of the killings -- a charge they deny. Since his installation after a September 2006 coup, Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont has travelled to the south to apologise for the heavy-handed military response of his ousted predecessor, Thaksin Shinawatra, but the violence has raged on. Thaksin, a billionaire telecoms tycoon, flooded the region with 30,000 troops and police, alienating many Muslims, but also promised millions of dollars in development aid in a backwater border region infamous for crime and smuggling. current spate of violence started in January 2004 with a raid on a military barracks and a slew of arson attacks on schools. After nearly a decade of relative calm in the region, the assault took Thai security forces completely by surprise.

Using optical simulation, the distance between OLED\u2013OPD and the aperture area of the OLED\u2013OPD has been optimized to enhance the AC/DC ratio of the receive PPG signal. The optical simulation incorporates an empirical optical skin model. All the patches incorporate green OLED@525 nm wavelength and red OLED@630 nm wavelength. Simulation results show that the optimized AC/DC ratio of the cross-type patch for the green and the red OLED is 2.16% and 6.25%, respectively. Similarly, the optimized AC/DC ratio of the square-type patch for the green, and the red OLED is 9.6% and 5.8%, respectively. Experiment results show that the received PPG signal AC/DC ratio for the square type and cross-type are 2%@green OLED and 4.5% @green OLED, respectively. Also, the AC/DC ratio of the received PPG signal from the square type and cross-type are 1.4%@red OLED and 1.1%@red OLED, respectively. The AC/DC ratio is reduced because the skin and blood itself act as a lossy medium so that the DC signal increased more; as a result, the overall AC/DC ratio decrease. The best design of the optical patch is the square-type OPD patch due to the wide area of the OPD. The OLED drive current ranges between 0.1 and 0.4 mA. The average OPD current is 800 nA. The flexibility of the design PPG sensor patch is 130\u00b0. The non-invasive square-type PPG sensor patch is applied to the wrist artery of 40 subjects for sensing the PPG pulsation of the blood vessel.

While we believe that they are good solutions, we have a different opinion on this subject. In fact we believe that it is possible to use network traffic monitoring tools like ntopng to spot many security issues that would make and IDS too complex/heavy to use (if possible at all). What many of our users are asking, is the ability to highlight possible scenarios where there is a potential security issue to be analysed more in details using more-security oriented tools. This while using a lightweight approach that an IDS cannot offer because it can be very verbose and information oriented, rather than providing an overall picture of the network status and help understanding real issues. For instance is a ping to a host a real problem? We don\u2019t think so, but most IDSs would mark this as a warning for \u201cinformation disclosure\u201d.

Video shot by a Reuters photographer showed men, women and children, some lying on blankets, midway across the bridge over the Rio Grande. Dozens of US border agents stood behind a gate topped with razor wire, which blocked the path into the US. Some migrants said they were trying to cross as a group into the US, and were frustrated that court dates kept being pushed backwards, leaving them uncertain of how long they would be stuck in Mexico. 191009140350939 \"We want to argue to cross over - we didn't ask to be in Mexico, they sent us here unjustly,\" said a man who declined to give his name.

They are based on the 80/20 rule of design, in that they are intended to cover the 20% of the material that users will need 80% of the time. For the remaining 80% of the material that is needed 20% of the time, students are directed to the Library\u2019s LibGuides.\nThe biggest challenge of doing these brochures was first deciding what to include, and then fitting it all onto the two sides of a single 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper. The Writing Centre originally asked for a single brochure with MLA on one side and APA on the other, based on the MLA and APA wall posters available from Purdue OWL. The problem was that if the contents of a wall poster are crammed onto an 8 1/2 sheet of paper, the text will be illegible, so I proposed two separate brochures, one for MLA and one for APA.\nI then selected a template in Microsoft Publisher and began tweaking it to suite my needs. In the end, the most useful thing that these brochures \u201cinherited\u201d from the original template was the Perpetua font, which works very well at small sizes and, because of it\u2019s very small x-height, looks sort of double spaced even when it isn\u2019t.

As far as I could tell there is no way to pass that option to GHC through Cabal so no .m files ever get built (well.. not completely true - setting ghc-options works but that breaks compilation of Haskell code). One way to get this to work would be to just add some extra code in Cabal to automatically pass -x c for .m files. This is probably a bad idea as someone might want or need to compile files using some other extension at some point. Another option is add some way of specifying compile options on a per-file (or group of files) basis: setting ghc-options to -x c just for one set of files. Still very limited but it's an improvement over the first option. Third option I can think of is to add a way of specifying compiler/extension pairs in Cabal so given compilers are automatically used to compile files with corresponding extensions. Depending on how much time I have I might look into adding this functionality myself but would like some feedback on which approach to take. Otherwise I might have to stick with autotools and ignore Cabal until it gets a bit more mature and flexible. -- Ticket URL: <> Hackage <> Hackage: Cabal and related projects", "Though spring is officially here, it is coming out little by little as usual.

I am interested in how individuality is expressed in an object and the way hand making humanizes it. The early European porcelains of Meissen and S\u00e8vres are my reference - but these symbols of perfection eliminate the mark of the maker. Disrupting, simplifying and transforming these objects with the imperfect touch create a bare essential caricature, exposing a raw rudeness. My ceramics investigate how rapid sketching becomes more animate and anthropomorphic with repetition and how this translates into sculptures of pottery. Exploring the idea of the pot as a relic, womb or container, certain elements become pivotal. Specifically, the opening may resemble the sore flush of a wound or the lure of an orifice, similarly, the belly may be a bulging paunch swollen with imaginary contents, held insecurely above a slender stem to emphasise it\u2019s frailty. Interacting with the material is a two way process. My practice of making, destroying and remaking parallels cycles of decay and renewal. I build, soak, push, squeeze, break, cut, tear and repair. To destroy and rebuild causes a lack of control, which adds motion to the making. The visible construction is similar to that of drawing, erasing and adjusting.Porcelain is chosen for its purity, sensitivity, movement during the firing and its paradoxical qualities of fragility and strength. Up to ten layers of coloured, transparent slips are painted to form a skin-like membrane. Digitally printed ceramic transfers, together with glaze and gold leaf allude to the porcelain\u2019s history.The sources for the still lives include the distorted, decaying, bawdy fruits of Luis Mel\u00e9ndez, the compositions of Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin and the painterly qualities of Paul Gauguin.", "Charlie\nI let go of my perfect puppy on July 29, 2016.

The challenges of producing a light source with 8-20 times longer life than conventional sources included color, temperature, cost and consistency in application. New technology brought about better efficiency using different materials and processes, resulting in wider uses in applications and reduced costs.\nEven though this rapidly advancing field has made great progress, the results have not photometrically (the amount of light cast on the target) been equal to the traditionalhalogen lamp. Professional lighting manufactureres however, have pursued LED lighting for two main reasons. First, the lumen per watt ratio is much better than traditional halogen. In simple terms, this means that you can power an LED lighting system with much less electricity than a traditional system. The comparison chartn below illustrates that a 20 watt 40 degree MR-16 lamp will generate a light pattern 11.6' in diameter with an intensity of 1.95 footcandles. A fixture with an LED array will generate a light pattern with a 10.09' diameter with an intensity of 2.07 footcandles. As you can see, the lighting effect is very similar, but the LED system LED system would only consume 60 watts. The retail cost of a 300 watt transformer is $317.50 while a 60 watt is $61.25, a significant savings. Additionally, in these \"green\" times where energy conservation is becoming the standard, yearly operating costs for the LED system is $17.52 as compared to $87.60 for the halogen system.", "When: Thu., Aug. 4, 6-9 p.m., Fri., Aug. 5, 6-9 p.m. and Aug. 6-15 2016\nSan Antonio artist Megan Solis, who just graduated in May with a Bachelor\u2019s of Fine Arts from the University of Texas at San Antonio, is the present resident at Hello Studio in the Blue Star Arts Complex.

There are over 250 evergreen shrubs and trees in the Asian tea family of plants. Camellia japonica is native to Japan, Korea and China. Its numerous variants produce pink or red flowers, some of which are simple and have five petals; some are more complex and rose-like. When the flower petals begin to wither, the whole flower head falls off. Camellias can grow quite tall and live up to 500 years. Camellia flowers are used as a decoration in Japanese tea ceremonies and the precious light yellow oil has been a beauty staple for centuries. The oil is one of the oldest known cooking oils used to make a range of dishes, such as Japanese tempura. It is rich in good fats and beneficial antioxidants. In Japan, unscented pure oil has been used to protect, nourish and moisturise skin for as long as the oil has existed. Gardenia-scented versions are worn to condition and perfume both skin and hair. Camellia oil has high vitamin E oleic acid (omega 9 monounsaturated fatty acid) content. Camellia oil has a higher oleic acid content (80-88%) than olive oil (70-77%). Vitamin E is an excellent antioxidant and considered important for both cell protection and for the maintenance of our immune system and healthy skin. Since vitamin E is a fat soluble antioxidant, it is well suited for use in a topical cosmetic formula. Camellia oil also helps to counteract the effects of hard water and we have found this oil to be very effective in our solid conditioners.BROWSE MORE INGREDIENTS", "Her cute tiny sex organ\nAll of these things create stress, shame and emotional conflicts.

The first, curated by Wylie, Shapiro, and Liboiron, discusses how contemporary scholarship is changing the way we identify, study, and respond to contaminants emitted through a range of conventional energy production practices. The second, curated by Jensen, discusses how people are conceiving, responding, and adapting to climate change and the new amphibious landscapes engendered by rising water-levels. The volume also features an article by Akerman et. al on a shift in epidemiology towards appreciating the role of environmental factors in causing human diseases, complemented by Allen\u2019s piece on a participatory science project that successfully measured local pollution levels, assessed their health impacts, and influenced environmental policy.

The cost of health care continues to stack up for those people who leave the doctor with a prescription for medication or a referral for diagnostic testing. Through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) the government subsidises the cost of prescription medications.\nWithin this cap, however, the price of medications can vary widely between pharmacies and between drug manufacturers. Price competition is available when generic medications are able to compete against branded medications, providing the public with a more affordable option. To date increases in the proportion of prescriptions filled with generic medications has occurred despite GP prescribing rates for generic medications remaining consistent at 14 per cent. While the government pays pharmacists an incentive to provide generic medications where possible, Australians still paid $53 million in brand premiums alone in 2009-10.\nReferrals for diagnostic testing also come with the chance that additional costs will be charged. Three out of ten referrals for imaging tests resulted in extra fees in 2009-10, as did 15 per cent of pathology referrals. This gap between pathology and imaging is larger now than it was when Medicare was introduced. The lower rate for pathology is likely to be due to the ability GPs have to determine when a test is bulk billed. Interestingly, GPs are more likely to bulk bill a pathology referral than their own services.

The authors developed an energy and environmental extended input\u2013output model, combined with the life cycle assessment, to analyse the role of the building sector in the reduction of Italian energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In detail, the model allows to assess the energy and environmental benefits arising from the Italian tax deduction policy for energy retrofit actions of buildings. Moreover, the authors defined an original model to assess the indirect rebound effect caused by the energy retrofit actions. The outcomes of the research point out that the assessment of the benefits arising from a specific sustainable policy, strongly depends on: - the indirect energy consumed by industry to produce goods and services needed for the policy actuation; - the indirect energy saving, owing to the implemented policy, which in the examined case study has the same order of magnitude as the direct one; - the rebound effect, often neglected in the literature, which can partially avoid the obtained benefits. The model shows wide ranges of applicability to the European context, since it uses as input economic and energy data usually available at local and/or national level for many states in Europe. It may represent a useful tool to decision-makers in the selection of policies oriented to the reduction of energy and environmental impacts caused by final consumption.\nNon ci sono file associati a questo prodotto.\nI documenti in IRIS sono protetti da copyright e tutti i diritti sono riservati, salvo diversa indicazione.", "Description\nWelcome to 3215 Whitegate Rd, Joliet.

Long-term use of prednisone can give rise to multiple side effects and morbidity. This randomized study was conducted to find out if prednisone could be withdrawn in recipients at least 1 yr after kidney transplantation. Eighty-four such recipients of a cadaveric kidney with stable renal function on cyclosporine and prednisone were randomized to continue prednisone (N = 42) or to withdraw prednisone in a 2-month period (N = 42). The main end point was the percentage of successful prednisone withdrawal. Both groups were compared for the incidence of infections and cardiovascular risk factors and for the incidence and cause of deterioration of renal function. All patients had a 14-month follow-up. In 67% (N = 28) of the patients, prednisone could be withdrawn successfully. Acute rejection was the main cause of withdrawal failure (N = 11, 26%). No grafts were lost due to rejection. In the prednisone withdrawal group, a tendency was noted for a lower incidence of infections (difference: 17%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -4% to 37%). After withdrawal, less antihypertensive drugs were necessary to control hypertension (difference: 0.5 drugs/patient; 95% CI: -0.9 to -0.1) and 35% less patients (23 of 41 versus nine of 42) needed cholesterol-lowering drugs (95% CI: -54% to -15%). A reduction of the frequency of patients with Type II diabetes mellitus was found (difference 10%; 95% CI: -24% to 5%) with a decrease of glycosylated hemoglobin (difference: 0.4 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.8). Disappearance of moonface was found in 25% of the patients.

Experiment.\nAnyway, my way of cooking went something like this. It fed three pretty heartily, and would doubtless suffice for four. Preheat the oven to 375F / 190C. Chop up half an aubergine, a courgette, a red pepper and half a pound / 100g of mushrooms. Take a teacup and pour in olive oil \u2013 I generally go about 1/3 of the way up, but you might want more or less. Add some balsamic vinegar, maybe half as much again, and any herbs you like the look of. (I used some crushed ginger, thyme, oregano and chilli powder). Spread the veggies on some aluminium foil on a baking tray, then drizzle the garnish over the top. Cook for about 15 minutes then shoogle them around. Once they\u2019re back in the oven, start boiling some water for pasta \u2013 my preference is penne for this, but whatever you have handy is good. Cook the pasta according to the instructions, ideally so that it\u2019ll be ready 15 minutes after the veggies went back in the oven, because that\u2019s when they should come out.

If you are a skilled programmer and very much \u201cinto\u201d online games then you probably think that Greg Hoglund and Gary McGraw\u2019s book would be relevant \u2013and it is if you are interested in \u201ccheating\u201d. In fact it has a wider appeal and if you are interested in \u201chacking\u201d or security in general then it contains quite a lot of interest. It does deal with the specifics of World of Warcraft and Second Life but there is a lot of generalisable discussion of how to attack distributed web-based systems. Of course most of the attacks described are well known and you aren\u2019t going to get very far if you simply attempt to use them. Their real value is as a guide to how you have to think to create new attacks. The point is that knowing how such a distributed system might be attacked gives you a clearer idea of what you have to do to protect it. Systems like these distributed gaming applications are also the way of the future. Software has to become increasingly distributed and parallel because we are at the end of the era where the power of a single processor increases without limit to one where the number of processors increases. The attacks that are currently being made on gaming systems probably represent the sort of security risks that general future systems are going to be subject to.

Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh analyzed 793 of the most popular songs in the youth market between 2005 and 2007 and found that about 25% of the songs that mention alcohol also mention a brand name. These songs often associated positive consequences with alcohol (41.5%), brands were often associated with wealth (63.4%), sex (58.5%), luxury objects (51.2%), partying (48.8%), other drugs (43.9%), and vehicles (39.0%). The researchers argue that frequent exposure of adolescents to brand-name references in popular music may \u2018constitute a form of advertising and could contribute to the early initiation and maintenance of substance use among adolescents\u2019. Furthermore, it is pointed out in the article that brands found in music, such as Patron Tequila, Grey Goose Vodka, and Hennessey Cognac, represent the same distilled spirits brands that are increasingly popular with underage drinkers, especially women. The article also examines the ties between the alcohol and music industries. Specifically pointed out are alcohol companies that have taken over record labels and artists with their own line of alcoholics product, such as Jay-Z (Armadale Vodka, 2002), Snoop Dogg (Landy Cognac, 2008) and Sean \u201cP. Diddy\u201d Combs (Ciroc Vodka, 2001). While most instances of brand-name references in song lyrics seem to be unsolicited and unpaid for by advertising companies, the relationship between alcohol producers and the music industry appears murky. The authors state that advertising companies have begun retroactively to reward artists with product, sponsorship, or endorsement deals after a song containing their product\u2019s name becomes popular.

While establishing himself as an in-demand songwriter, Higgs was also developing a solo vocal career as well as working as a high school music teacher. The role of teacher suited Higgs and he was soon working regularly as a vocal arranger and coach as well as guitar instructor. The most famous of his pupils was Bob Marley. It was under Higgs' tutelage that Marley's guitar playing greatly improved but, more significantly, it was Higgs that arranged the beautiful trio singing of Marley and fellow Wailers Peter Tosh and Bunny Livingstone (later Bunny Wailer). So integral was Higgs to the creation of this sound that when Bunny abruptly left the band in 1973 in the eve of their first major American tour, Higgs filled in brilliantly. As a solo performer Higgs' success was intermittent at best and his work appreciated mainly by hardcore reggae afficiandos. After spending the early part of his career singing as part of a duo with Delroy Wilson, Higgs went solo after Wilson left Jamaica for America in the late 60s. But, it wasn't until 1976 that he released his first solo album, Life of Contradiction, a title that accurately summarized Higgs' career up to that point. The follow-up album, Unity is Power, was equally good, but as impossible to find. It wasn't until 1985 when Alligator records, a label best known for blues music, released Higgs' masterpiece, Triumph. Since that time he kept a low profile, issuing a record every now and then, his work revered by reggae fans around the world. The greatest reggae artist you've never heard of, Higgs died December 18, 1999.", "Activity and Property Landscape Modeling is at the Interface of Chemoinformatics and Medicinal Chemistry\nProperty Landscape Modeling (PLM) methods and, more specifically, Activity Landscape Modeling (ALM) methods -where the \u2018property\u2019 is a biological activity- are emerging approaches to mine systematically structure-property/activity relationships (SPRs/SARs). ALM studies are relatively fast to execute and easy to interpret (provided that the appropriate structural representations are used). While it is well-accepted that the presence of activity cliffs in data sets has a detrimental effect in predictive computational modeling, the activity cliffs also have a \u2018dual face\u2019 in medicinal chemistry; activity cliffs have a beneficial aspect because of its high information content. However, cliffs may interrupt the \u2018SAR-by-design\u2019 practice that often relies on the similarity principle. To date, most of the published PLM/ALM studies have been developed by chemoinfomatitians using benchmark or public data sets in a retrospective manner. However, it is desirable if more medicinal chemists integrate the identification (if any) and interpretation of activity cliffs. Depending on the size of the data set and the complexity of the screening data (e.g., number of endpoints), an experienced medicinal chemist could rapidly identify all the property/activity cliffs. Alternatively, especially for large screening data sets, computational approaches can greatly help to identify such cliffs in a systematic manner. Either by visual inspection or through the use of computational analysis, the recommendation is to analyze the presence of activity cliffs. Such practice will enhance the understanding of the SAR, the development of local SAR models that later can be translated into global SAR models. Future Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 7, No. 9.

Seed addition increased internal invader seedling densities and the probability of successful colonization per species. Legumes,\ntall herbs and species with large and long-lived seeds or a requirement for specific vectors for pollination and dispersal benefited from seed addition most. The number of successfully established internal invader species was highest in plots with low initial species richness and in the regularly weeded treatments and lowest in plots with high initial species richness and in the never weeded treatments, indicating decreased recruitment with increased successional age. Resident plant communities with legumes had mostly negative (legume and small- and tall-herb internal invaders, external invaders) or neutral (grass invaders) effects on seedling density and colonization probability of invader species whereas resident communities with grasses had positive effects on the colonization probability of invader species except grasses themselves. These results show that seed limitation, invader characteristics, and community characteristics all can affect recruitment success in predictable ways, suggesting non-random community assembly during succession starting from different initial species pools.", "i was a little caution and under-confident when i started, so i sat in the back at the start. since this is basically the beginners/sport category most of the guys are not particularly strong with the technical skills. because i was on a single speed i had two concerns; one, i needed momentum for the little hills, and two i would really have to spin to pass anyone on the flats. i was getting kind of frustrated at first because these guys in front of me were braking all the time and putting me further and further in back of the race. this course was like a roller coaster single track, short steep descents followed by short climbs. if you went all out on the descents you could make it to the top of the other side with hardly even pedaling. unfortunately the guys in front of me were always breaking on the descent and killing everyone\u2019s momentum.\ni eventually learned how to race and soon found myself passing at will. not exactly at will, but good enough that i could slowly move up in the race. i learned to back off just a bit on the descent so i didn\u2019t have to break on the way down, and once or twice i timed it so well i passed right at the top of the climb. i passed a couple of guys on the flats, while spinning about 150 rpms (that was tough to recover from). i ended up about 10th out of 22, which is not horrible. i felt great and not one person passed me.\nwhy is the ex-cyclist racing?", "powered digital assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Cortana, voice search is poised to become the next frontier for digital marketers. comScore predicts that by 2020, more than half of all searches will come from voice search.

No one loved it. As is customary in reacting to John Updike's books, the sexual content was a major distraction for at least one reader. Many felt it was entirely satirical - poking fun at the feminist movement in particular. One reader suggested that the joke was: look what happens when women become \"liberated and empowered,\" they become witches. We noted that all three witches became supernaturally empowered only after they were widowed, as the book said this was the prerequisite for becoming a witch or \"getting in touch\" with one's essential female witchiness. There was disagreement over whether the witches were entirely as bad as critics suggested. Some felt that Alexandra was the most fully-developed and sympathetic character and that the author seemed fond of his witches in spite of their jealous and destructive tendencies. Several who had read other works of Updike felt it was not his best work. Not a one of the readers were particularly interested in witchcraft or Wicca. Most agreed the style was quite elaborate but this didn't bother anyone as much as it bothered the librarian, who likes a more straightforward narrative and descriptive style.\nWould the group recommend this title for other book groups? Maybe, maybe not. Some readers felt the book was dated and has not stood the test of time (it was published in 1984 and takes place in the late 1960's.) It would probably be a better choice to read the Rabbit series by Updike if no one in the group has read those yet.\nRating for bookgroup reading: two out of five bookmarks.", "Executive Summary\nThe danger posed by Russia\u2019s inadequately secured stocks of nuclear weapons and fissile material is a major national security concern for the United States. Various cooperative U.S.- Russian programs aimed at securing nuclear material, weapons, and design intelligence have been mounted since the 1990s, but clever and determined adversaries may be able to circumvent or defeat the defenses that the United States and its partners are attempting to put in place. U.S. programs are by their nature reactive: they have long time horizons; they focus preeminently on the supply side of the problem; and they face serious technological limitations. Russia\u2019s imperfect commitment to nonproliferation also undermines the effectiveness of U.S. nonproliferation efforts.\nThere are no easy ways to close the nuclear proliferation window. A proactive and intelligence- based nuclear security policy, one that complements existing programs while enabling authorities to do a better job of targeting and preventing proliferation damage, is needed to counter this threat. Various measures to strengthen nuclear security policy could include the use of \u201cvulnerability profiles\u201d of each Russian facility that handles weapons-usable nuclear materials and better collaboration with Russian and other former Soviet security organizations. A comprehensive nuclear security strategy must also focus more attention and resources on the demand side of the proliferation equation. The United States cannot conduct nonproliferation work effectively without reference to adversaries\u2019 programs for weapons of mass destruction and procurement aims.

The only kind of advertising that has to deal with tobacco should be associated with stop smoking. Such advertising should help people to bring up smoking or should inform people about risks of smoking and about consequences that are involved. Comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising and promoting can result in a considerable reduction of tobacco consumption on a national level. Tobacco advertising should be banned from television, billboards, magazines, the internet and other places where one might find the advertising. Tobacco advertising is one of the worst kinds of advertising because it is pretty much telling everyone that it is okay to smoke because others are doing it also. Furthermore, tobacco advertising must be forbidden because it would be the most effective among teenagers, the easiest to be influenced by bad examples, fashions and emulation because of their psychological immaturity that lead them to adopt smoking as a mask to appear and feel themselves more adult. Tobacco advertising must be banned forever only thinking to how much the cures against cancer, too frequently useless, are expensive for the sanitary systems of all the world; these very high costs have surely never been paid by tobacco multinationals, except for the damages paid, after recent long trials, to a minimum part of the victims of this \"trendy\" and \"safe\" vice.", "A much wide physicians and their grimmer cells.

Sandals are amazing and sophisticated type of shoes. What better footwear can you choose for hot summer days to keep your feet cool and dry? Sandals are not only practical but also highly fashionable and available in many types and colors. Sandals are nowadays a summer necessity. You can chose from large variety depending on your needs and style. High heel sandals will add some elegance and glamour to your look. Flat sandals are perfect for everyday use, for casual or more formal occasion. Sole of sandals can be made out of wood, leather, rubber or tatami, depending on their function. Most sandals have strap or lace that holds them to the foot and that passes between toes, over the arch or around the ankle. Sandals are the oldest and most commonly found foot covering worldwide. The oldest sandals were dated 8 000 years old. Western culture traces the origins of the sandal from ancient Egyptians, who wore sandals made of palm-leaves and papyrus. Egyptians considered sandals as a symbol of the pharaoh's sovereignty. The word sandal comes from its Latin name sandalium. Sandals were worn through out the all decades from ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans to the modern times. High-fashion sandals have remained a staple in women's wardrobes since the 1930s. In early twentieth century low-heeled sandals made of wide leather or cotton straps became a popular beach footwear. By the late 1930s, the sandal was a fully reinstated necessity in a fashionable shoe wardrobe and included styles for all times of day.", "Kinesiology\nKinesiology (kin-easy-ology) is a holistic health discipline that originated in the 1960\u2019s by chiropractor Dr George Goodheart who combined Western techniques and Eastern wisdom to create Applied Kinesiology. He used Kinesiology to clear blockages and deal with the real cause of the problem, drawing out the emotional as well as the physical aspect of the health issue. Kinesiology accesses and defuses much of the stress and emotion that lies at the root of many health problems. It does this by muscle testing, using bio-feedback - like a direct access into your brain's blueprint. Your body/mind has stored every experience you\u2019ve ever had, including emotions, stresses, memories and so forth. This influences your current level of health often resulting in physical pain, illness, anxiety, stress, digestive imbalance, relationship difficulties, low confidence, depression etc. Your Kinesiologist uses this information along with a range of techniques to unblock energy and release stresses. These techniques include acupressure, reflex points, Chi & meridian therapy, specific body movements, Bach Flower Essences, nutritional and lifestyle changes and much more. Kinesiology can help to relieve pain, stress, muscular and nervous disorders, detect food sensitivities, nutritional deficiencies, assist with learning difficulties, stimulate energy and release untapped potential. It is safe to use on people of all ages for the promotion of physical, mental & emotional well-being.

This morning was a mad rush to get all the materials for my lesson gathered and packed, then a quick trip to the store to buy the ingredients for the lesson (\"How to Cook a Variety of Vegetables\") and I was off to Julies's to teach. I tried to squeeze a little too much into the time I had but we covered it all...I just had to talk fast! We cooked and tasted a variety of vegetables cooked in many different ways (steamed, baked, roasted, sauteed, & raw) which was the real fun part of it all. Prior to running out the door I ate leftovers from last night for my lunch...it was either leftovers or PB&J again given the time restraints. Tomorrow the pace should be a lot more moderate so hopefully I can get something a little more interesting on here.

Some of the defects that arise during the service life of a building can be attributed to poor construction practice and inadequate quality control measures during constructions which culminate in early unplanned maintenance. It is against this backdrop that this research was carried out to examine the effects of faulty design on the construction and maintenance of building projects. In achieving these objectives, the study adopts a survey technique with a total of 45 questionnaires mainly for the professionals and craftsmen in the industry in which 35 were retrieved and used for the analysis. A survey of randomly selected samples of 25 building professionals and 20 craftsmen were conducted. Questionnaires were used to collect data from the team. Data collected were analyzed using the frequency table, mean item score, one sample z test. The study revealed that the use of construction management and the involvement of competent professionals would help reduce the effect of design failure. Loss of life was discovered to be the major effect of faulty design on the construction industry. The analysis reveals that the causes of faulty design have a significant effect on the construction and maintenance of building projects. The failures of buildings also have significant effects on the stakeholders. The study recommended among others that there should be a design review before finally approving the design for construction maintenance experts should not be overlooked in the planning stage of the project. ..", "Sanders IS a Democrat and Hillary now could lose BOTH states to him.Understand?If Clinton wants the nomination she has to win at least one of them.Tick tick tick....plead the 5th!So f Ing enjoyable..

So nothing good or bad would happen. I think people care way to much about politicians, they will not solve your problems or make them any worse.

Fire everybody.\"\nWhat I see the team doing is addressing positions of need while managing their available cap in such a way that they have plenty of room to sign rookies and make some other moves if they so choose. I don't love every decision they've made (case in point, letting Corey Peters walk) but overall, I feel like they're doing an adequate job of addressing need in a responsible, strategic way. This is a team that has won 10 games over two seasons, and with so many changes on the field and on the sideline, it's reasonable to expect that it will take more than one offseason to fix this team's deficiencies. Unless we get through the draft and find that they have once again opted to act like pass rushers are poison, I'm pretty content with the approach so far this offseason.\nBut maybe you don't agree. This is your opportunity to share your strategy for fixing this team.

Give consideration to yourself fortunate!", "DISASTER! Okay, so I've used Oz before to move locally in the city. I got a hardworking crew and, wanting to save some money, I did the packing myself. The move was fine so I decided on using them again. This time, I moved from NY to Mass. Since my mother has passed away, I had several antique & sentimental items from her. The person on the phone said I was getting a VIP Crew that specialized in moving antiques. After spending a substantial amount on the move, I later found out that was just \"talk\" and there actually is no such thing as a VIP Crew. They totally lied! I had decided to let Oz do some of the packing. BIG MISTAKE!!! After I explained to the crew that I had an antique French chandelier from my mother, that needed to be packed separately, one of the guys packed it with a heavy microwave. The microwave obviously crushed it. One of the men also packed a Limoges charger with a brass lamp. The lamp crushed the charger. My armoire is damaged. There are nicks in several pieces of furniture. The lesson learned: IF YOU HAVE VALUABLE ITEMS DO NOT USE OZ. Since the move, communicating with them has been a nightmare. I also still can\u00e2t get over how dishonest they were. Why would you assure someone that you are sending a VIP crew who specializes in antiques when that kind of crew doesn\u00e2t exist. Not to mention, I think anyone with half a brain would know that you don\u00e2t pack very fragile items with extremely heavy ones. What a NIGHTMARE!", "I tried asking for help from someone in person, but they weren't willing to stand up and come and look, so instead I had to print out the paper explaining it below. Rather than take the screen shots again and upload them, I figured I'd just upload the PDF of what I printed. On the left I have two very similar screen shots... the top shows the program running with font size 20, while the bottom shows the program running with font size 14 (which is what it's set to in the example code.) Notice that the middle cell on the top one cuts off \"game!!\" while the middle cell on the bottom one properly includes it. On the right, I have what I believe is all the relevant snippets of code Basically my issue is that neither the text view nor the cell is setting the height properly. Therefor, there seems to be either: a.) an issue with how I'm using the sizeWithFont:constrainedToSize:lineBreakMode method b.) an issue with how the above method calculates height. I suspect the issue lies in the fact that sizeWithFont:constrainedToSize:lineBreakMode is calculating it's height using something other than a UITextView. What makes me think this? Because it includes \"lineBreakMode\" as one of its parameters. Text wrapping can't be set on a UITextView... but it can be set on a UILabel. The dumb part is that UILabel will ignore anything related to wrapping and instead the only values that make a difference are whether (and where) to truncate, or to simply crop.", "Hawker Beechcraft: GA Deliveries Up\nIn first-quarter reports released this week, Hawker Beechcraft reported aircraft deliveries in its business and general aviation segments were up compared to the same period last year, but revenues were down. Hawker said it delivered 45 business and GA aircraft in the first quarter 2011, compared to 34 in the first quarter 2010. \"We are coming off of a solid 2010 and our momentum into 2011 is encouraging,\" said CEO Bill Boisture. \"While the first quarter is historically a quieter one for the industry, we believe the uptick in our aircraft shipments and increased backlog is evidence of the ongoing demand for our products.\" Despite higher delivery numbers, however, revenues were down by about $49 million over last year, at $286 million. The company said the decrease was due to a higher percentage of lower-priced aircraft in the 2011 deliveries, plus lower revenues from the sale of used aircraft received as trade-ins.\nBoisture said other factors contributed to the \"significant losses\" in the business and GA segment, including higher sales and marketing expenses related to international expansion, expenses associated with cost-reduction initiatives, and continuing weakness in the general aviation market. \"Due to strong sales in the fourth quarter of 2010, we started the year with fewer jets in inventory, which in turn led to four fewer jet deliveries compared to the first quarter of last year,\" he said. \"However, we delivered 15 more Beechcraft aircraft versus last year -- including several special mission aircraft -- which speaks to the market recognizing the inherent attributes of Beechcraft products' efficiency and utility, especially in a down market.\" He added that he is \"cautiously optimistic\" that a recovery for GA will begin next year, as most industry analysts have forecasted.", "Shawna Jean \u201cNawny\u201d (Mann) Adkins of Kenova\nShawna Jean \u201cNawny\u201d (Mann) Adkins, 50, of Kenova died Tuesday, December 13, 2011 at the Cabell Huntington Hospital.

I'm proposing to add some tool that automatically formats source code. Main purpose is overall productivity. It's possible to save time on manual formatting. Also, reading a uniformly formatted code is easier. Some new languages has one correct coding style and code formatters. Examples are Go ( and (to be done) Rust ( I suggest to read 'Motivation - why use a formatting tool' from second link. There is no single correct coding style in C and C++ worlds: different projects use different styles if any at all. But there is a tool which does formatting and supports different styles: clang-format. It's a binary available for every major platform. It's configurable: just put .clang-format file with formatting options in source directory and formatter will use it for current and nested directories. I actually do not propose here to use exactly clang-format but as I know it's the best of its kind. Here is a demo  Tool is configurable but it will not act exactly as you might expect and this is a pay for uniformity. So, let's add .clang-format to root directory, start using and polishing style. Here is some info on how to add it to some text editors  I do not(!) suggesting to reformat whole project. At least for now. Here is my PR to add .clang-format files to server and InnoDB:  I think that eventually .clang-format usage will lead to reformatting everything and having some project-wide precommit hook which will properly format your diffs. Do you have any objections or questions on having such a tool?

This feature helps improve information gathering, increasing the amount of intelligence captured. This feature also can help confirm details about the target, possible accomplice activity, and help Law Enforcement move quickly against criminals, terrorists, or suspected felons. HSS Cellular Intercept Systems can also capture the signals of the Control Channel frequencies, aiding in the ability to monitor the call as it moves between cellular antenna sites. In cellular communications, the Control Channels represent the frequencies used to communicate with the cellular network to prevent calls from getting dropped. When cellular phone conversations take place, cell phone handsets send and receive radio signals to and from cellular antenna towers. The path these radio signals flow in is characterized as a pattern of multi-directional flow. For Interception, the flow encompasses forward and reverse directions. These directions classify the flow of signals traveling over channels, called forward and reverse channels. The Forward channels manage the movement of signals from the cellular towers to the cellular phone handsets. The Reverse Channels manage the movement of signals from the cellular phone handsets to the cellular towers. The towers, in turn, connect with the party other than the cellular phone handset. In order to keep track of the target\u2019s communication, and prevent a loss of the signals carrying the communication, there needs to be a synchronous monitoring of the Control Channel activity. Without this feature, the intercepted communication could be lost once the channel carrying the communication signals change.

This has created a large backlog of work and upstaging of disease with consequent increases in risk and cost of treatment and potential for worse long-term outcomes. As countries emerge from lockdown but with COVID-19 endemic in society, precautions remain that restrict 'normal' practice. In this article, we propose a methodology for restructuring services for patients with HVD and provide recommendations pertaining to frequency of follow-up and use of echocardiography at present. It will be almost impossible to practice exactly as we did prior to the pandemic; thus, it is essential to prioritise patients with the greatest clinical need, such as those with symptomatic severe HVD. Local procedural waiting times will need to be considered, in addition to usual clinical characteristics in determining whether patients requiring intervention would be better suited having surgical or transcatheter treatment. We present guidance on the identification of stable patients with HVD that could have follow-up deferred safely and suggest certain patients that could be discharged from follow-up if waiting lists are triaged with appropriate clinical input. Finally, we propose that novel models of working enforced by the pandemic-such as increased use of virtual clinics-should be further developed and evaluated.", "Strateties for alpha male dating Adult chat rooms with avatars\nFake Alpha Males and the mistakes they make You\u2019ll learn \u2013 The gap between the image you want others to have of you, and the real you.

Zeiss Victory Varipoint riflescopes offer the best possible shooting conditions whether in day or night time. The reticle is seated in the first focal plane and it changes with magnification in order to remain in scale with the target. The illuminated dot however retains its size since it is seated in the second focal plane. This means that by high magnification long distance shooting it will not cover a large part of the target and will make it easier to aim properly. The illuminated dot is also, at low magnification and close range shooting, bigger compared to the target and makes it therefore easier for quick aiming. The brightness of the illumination can be adjusted so that the dot can be used when hunting in the dark or when hunting on driven game, when the sun is bright and the visibility clear. All lens surfaces of Zeiss Victory Varipoint riflescopes are multi coated with the special Zeiss T* coating to ensure excellent image sharpness and good light transmission in the dark at the same time. The outer lens surfaces are protected with LocuTec coating to prevent dew and dirt accumulation. Zeiss Victory Varipoint riflescopes are also filled with dry nitrogen to prevent dew accumulation at low temperatures. They are also very useful for users with glasses since they have adjustable oculars for a dioptre range from \u2013 4 to +2.\nThe M mark stands for Zeiss Victory Varipoint riflescopes that have a mountable steel rail on the housing..", "I desire your hands once more exploring my skin Our fingers entwined weaving our love story There are no lies here, Only the honesty of our gentle sin.

Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 9. ISSN 2296-634X\nAbstract\n\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Beamer and Corr\u00eaa. p38 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), that responds primarily to stress stimuli. p38 has a number of targets for phosphorylation, including MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2). MK2 primarily functions as a master regulator of RNA-binding proteins, indirectly controlling gene expression at the level of translation. The role of MK2 in regulating the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines downstream of inflammation and cellular stress is well-described. A significant amount of evidence, however, now points to a role for the p38MAPK-MK2 signaling axis in mediating synaptic plasticity through control of AMPA receptor trafficking and the morphology of dendritic spines. These processes are mediated through control of cytoskeletal dynamics via the activation of cofilin-1 and possibly control of the expression of Arc/Arg3.1. There is evidence that MK2 is necessary for group I metabotropic glutamate receptors long-term depression (mGluR-LTD). Disruption of this signaling may play an important role in mediating cognitive dysfunction in neurological disorders such as fragile X syndrome and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. To date, the role of neuronal MK2 mediating synaptic plasticity in response to inflammatory stimuli has not yet been investigated. In immune cells, it is clear that MK2 is phosphorylated following activation of a broad range of cell surface receptors for cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. We propose that neuronal MK2 may be an important player in the link between inflammatory states and dysregulation of synaptic plasticity underlying cognitive functions. Finally, we discuss the potential of the p38MAPK-MK2 signaling axis as target for therapeutic intervention in a number of neurological disorders.", "LMU-3030 GPS tracker of CalAmp company, allows you to program different SMS alerts and receive on a mobile phone or could locate in real-time their service routes or deliveries tasks with hours of service control and their fuel consumption control within a Tracking Management Platform via Web.

Thank you Nancy!\nAWESOME movie and they truly stayed true to the book (just like The Help I saw two weeks ago) which is usually my problem when I had read the book prior to seeing the movie. This was amazing and the cinematography made you feel like you were actually in the scene. The acting was terrific and the little girl who plays Sara was fantastic. She has such expression in her eyes. We got the chance after the preview to ask the adorable french jewish director questions and I asked if the author of the book had a lot to do with the movie. His answer was \u201cWe kinda gave birth to this movie together!\u201d An interesting fact he told us was that in this round-up they did not take French Jews, only the foreign Jews living in the French area. Problem they encountered was these foreigners had babies who were actually born in France and they did not know what to do about that situation \u2013 so just took them as well. The director said he had lost family in the Holocaust and because there are so many people who don\u2019t know about this horrible event, he wanted to do this movie to bring it to their attention. So it opens July 29th and I believe The Help does not open til Aug 12th\u2026so my recommendation is definitely see both with kleenex ready!!!\nWe love hearing from you!

My intention was to keep one drake and all resulting ducks in our 50'x100' garden for slug control and eggs, but I believe we have 3 drakes (too many for 3 ducks) and I loff them. The little ladies (despite identical upbringing, age, and pea-laden training sessions), completely panic when we are moving around them. The drakes are lovely little pets and run to me when they are called (with peas). I'm trying to decide whether everyone would be happier if we keep all the drakes in the garden, keep the ducks in the front room of the chicken coop, and let the ducks share a yard with the chickens (35'x35' for 15 hens and a rooster), or rehome a couple of my darling boy duckies and keep everyone in the garden. The downside to keeping two runner flocks is that I will have two kiddie pools to maintain and there might be complications in keeping the ducks with the chickens (eg the chickens like to be let out of the fenced yard to free-range but I don't really trust the ducks to safely range and return). My husband falls back to \"whatever you want, dear\" and no one else I know has ducks. It seems harder to maintain two duck flocks and we're already busy, but the little drakes are just so endearing!

This fall, students are learning to tell a story using primary source documents, with curriculum provided by Gilder Lehrman and the Rockefeller Foundation.

Sato et al. (2014) found that coral boulders reworked from reef edge by tsunamis showed a measurable remanent magnetization with spinner magnetometer. However, the origin of magnetic minerals in coral skeletons is poorly constrained between detrital and biogenic magnetic minerals. To determine the magnetic mineralogy of coral skeletons, we conducted ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy, first-order reversal curve (FORC) measurements, and scanning electron microscopy observations of acid-treated residuals of coral skeletons collected from Ishigaki Island, Miyako Island, and Tonga. FORC diagrams of the boulders with coral skeletons and microbial mats showed a narrow ridge along the Hc axis with negligible vertical spread, being called as \u201ccentral ridge\u201d which indicates the presence of intact magnetosomes (Egli et al., 2010). FMR spectra of the same boulders represented an obvious secondary absorption peak on lower field side of main peak, which are explained as result from uniaxial anisotropy of magnetosome (e.g., Weiss et al., 2004; Charilaou et al., 2011). Although the FORC diagrams from single Porites skeletons also had the central ridge feature, the FMR spectra represented multiple lower field absorption peaks which is different from the signature of magnetosome-bearing coral skeletons. This suggests that coral boulders with microbial mats showed the presence of magnetites aligned in magnetosome chain structures like those produced by the magnetotactic bacteria, whreas single Porites coral skeletons showed the higher contribution of detrital magnetite with trace amount of biogenic magnetites.", "The Internet has come a long way, from static HTML pages, over online shopping pages and photo albums, to community-driven sites like FaceBook, Digg, del.icio.us and Twitter, to rich user experiences provided by the likes of Google or Yahoo!

Our medium replica Tolix stool in galvanised fits into this category and is ideal for those looking for a strong and durable stool that will withstand frequent daily use.\nThis stylish stool is made from steel in the same way as the original and has been galvanised for extra strength which also makes it suitable for indoor/outdoor use, adding to its versatility. It features the same boxy shape and splayed legs, together with the rectangular drainage slit on the seat. Standing at 66cm high, it can be comfortably used with tables and counters measuring between 90-100cm, anything higher and we\u2019d recommend you choose a 76cm stool. It has cross struts beneath the seat to make it even stronger, and also features an integrated foot rest as well as rubber stops on the feet to prevent damage to your floor.\nWith its natural galvanised finish this stool has a raw edgy look which would work really well in an industrial themed setting. Just imagine rows of these stools lined up beneath jet black counters with a backdrop of exposed brickwork. They\u2019re also handy for use outdoors on a pavement area and could be grouped around wooden beer barrels for a rustic look. Since they take up less room than a chair they\u2019re a great way of maximising every inch of your floor space and could be placed into tight corners and small recesses to get more bums on seats, and hopefully increase your turnover. Stackable too, they make for convenient storage and since they require no assembly, they\u2019re ready to put out to work right away.."]
