The company is facing a court hearing on Wednesday.Credit...Lucas Jackson/Reuters      Nov. 23, 2015  As FanDuel braced for a court hearing that could determine the fate of daily fantasy sports in New York, the company demonstrated that it remained committed to advertising its website there.  FanDuel is the title sponsor of the Legends Classic, a college basketball event that was held Monday at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Fans attending that night\u2019s games, between Louisiana State and Marquette and between North Carolina State and Arizona State, could not help noticing FanDuel\u2019s presence.  The company\u2019s logo was plastered on the court, on the scorer\u2019s table, on the video screen and across electronic billboards throughout the arena. There were even FanDuel seat covers, with the company\u2019s name prominently displayed on the front and back of the teams\u2019 benches.  The Legends Classic, which concludes with two more games on Tuesday, is being held at a difficult time for FanDuel.  On Nov. 10, New York\u2019s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, ordered FanDuel and the rival website DraftKings to stop accepting bets in the state. A hearing to consider the order is scheduled for Wednesday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.  \u201cWe are following through on a commitment that we made months ago with a very good partner before the New York A.G. issued any letter or made any case against us,\u201d a FanDuel spokeswoman said of the Legends Classic sponsorship.  The spokeswoman added that the company was continuing to fulfill all sponsorship and advertising agreements it had made. FanDuel also has partnerships with the Nets, the Jets and the Buffalo Bills. ", " \u201cI think my credibility would be affected if I didn\u2019t ask experts for their opinion,\u201d he said.  The governor also said that the discrepancy between the predictions and the actual statistics was because of the behavior of New Yorkers themselves. With some exceptions, New Yorkers have managed to follow the restrictions on movement and socializing.  Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, seemed to agree and congratulated Mr. Cuomo and his counterparts on Friday for having slowed the tide of infections in their states.  \u201cThat has dramatically changed because of the impact of what the citizens of New York and New Jersey and across Connecticut and now Rhode Island are doing to really change the course of this pandemic,\u201d Dr. Birx said.  It is, of course, prudent politically and for public health reasons that elected leaders over-plan, not under-plan, for disasters. During hurricanes, for instance, governors are much more likely to save their constituents\u2019 lives, and their own jobs, by ordering evacuations early rather than banking on the chance that a storm will peter out.  The main objective in \u201cflattening the curve\u201d of the outbreak, apart from keeping people from dying, is to slow the spread enough to keep hospitals functioning.  And from the start of the coronavirus emergency, Mr. Cuomo has repeatedly taken the position that he would rather be prepared for a dire scenario that never came to pass than to blithely put his faith in optimistic forecasts. Ironically, his doomsday attitude may complicate his efforts to keep the state on course as New Yorkers start to realize that the worst has not happened and eventually get itchy to go out.

They also include former fighters and relatives of those known as martyrs who died fighting with Hezbollah, who are hard to dismiss.

He said he had not been directly threatened, but that an unknown assailant had stabbed him in the arm one night.  \u201cMy father asked why I\u2019m getting myself into trouble,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I told him I\u2019m doing the right thing.\u201d  Mr. Jarjoui remained loyal to Hezbollah\u2019s cause, he said, just not its domestic politics. \u201cThe resistance is above all suspicion, but I\u2019m against members of Parliament in the party.\u201d  Still, the longer the protests go on without substantial political change or economic succor, the more fatigue and fatalism have crept in.

The AP reported that the Department of Homeland Security blocked Mr. Khatib after discovering \u201cderogatory information\u201d about him. Mr. Khatib had planned to fly from Istanbul to Los Angeles on Saturday. The AP said he had been detained earlier in the week by Turkish officials for undisclosed reasons, and that he needed a passport waiver to travel to the United States, which was denied. Raed Saleh, the leader of the White Helmets, was also to attend the Oscars; there was no indication that his plans were upended. Mr. Khatib had planned to attend the ceremony after the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban was lifted. The ban had halted or slowed travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Syria, but it was frozen by the courts. A member of the White Helmets, a group that searches for survivors in the rubble of bombed-out buildings, Mr. Khatib also filmed the group\u2019s rescue efforts for the 40-minute film, which was made for Netflix and directed by Orlando von Einsiedel. In an interview with The Times earlier this month, Mr. Khatib said he hoped his appearance at the Oscars would convey the urgent message of the movie, and pressure President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime and the Russian government to stop bombing Syrian civilians. Representatives for the filmmakers and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ", " About one million Americans each year receive some sort of direct aid from FEMA, according to the agency.  In addition to the $750 payment per household, FEMA said it would create a new program, called Displacement Assistance, to help people who need to stay in hotels, or with friends or family. Weather-related disasters pushed more than 3.3 million American adults out of their homes in 2022, census data shows. Of those, at least 1.2 million were displaced for a month or longer.  FEMA is also ending one of its most criticized rules, which requires disaster survivors seeking assistance to first apply for, and be rejected for, a loan from the Small Business Administration, regardless of whether they own a small business.  \u201cWe heard that survivors found it confusing and challenging to apply for an S.B.A. loan,\u201d Ms. Criswell said.  Han Nguyen, a spokesman for the Small Business Administration, said in a statement that the agency \u201capplauds FEMA\u2019s decision.\u201d  FEMA said it would also make it easier for people whose homes had been damaged to get money to rebuild. And if a home requires upgrades for people with disabilities \u2014 for example, adding a ramp to the front door \u2014 FEMA would pay for those changes.  In another change, disaster survivors who are self-employed and whose tools are lost or damaged would be able to get money to replace that equipment.  The agency is also streamlining existing programs. Disaster survivors who miss the agency\u2019s application deadlines will no longer need to provide documents showing why their application was late. And it will be easier for people who are turned down by FEMA to appeal, the agency said. ", " Armando Joseph Greco was born on Aug. 14, 1926, in Philadelphia.

First baseman Yuli Gurriel, who was Correa\u2019s teammate for six years, said Correa was \u201cvery active\u201d sending messages to Astros players on Friday night and that Correa was having trouble sleeping given the big decision on his plate.  Gurriel said Astros players were surprised and they had hoped that Correa would return. He said he never imagined Correa would end up in Minnesota but he understood the business side of the sport.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to miss him,\u201d Gurriel said. \u201cHe helped me a lot here, not only on defense but with a lot of aspects that I needed to get better at, like sabermetrics.\u201d  Astros Manager Dusty Baker said he heard the news from his wife on Saturday morning.

Maldonado said the opt-outs in the deal were something Correa \u201creally wanted.\u201d He continued, \u201cHe\u2019s betting on himself again.

But Ainge also knows this solid foundation will never soar high enough without his reaching for or drafting a couple of prime-time stars. How he plays the enviable hand dealt to him by the Nets in the summer of 2013 will determine whether the Celtics can rise from the pack to challenge, or supplant, LeBron James\u2019s conference supremacy in Cleveland.  The assets lifted from the Nets for what turned out to be a Barclays Center house call by Pierce and Garnett included the Nets\u2019 first-round draft picks in 2016 and 2018 and the right to exchange first-round picks in 2017.  The deal has made Ainge look like a rock star. But hold off on the standing ovation, he suggested, insisting that only luck has thus far been the residue of design.  \u201cI honestly did not look at that deal as a bonanza at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really thought the most likely scenario would be that all of those picks would be in the 20s.

Start with these sample lesson plans. Credit...Nadia Hafid  Published March 20, 2020Updated March 23, 2020  As coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, we\u2019re working to answer the questions on many parents\u2019 minds. This is a fast-moving situation, so some information may be outdated. For the latest updates, read The New York Times\u2019s live coronavirus coverage here.  Across the United States, parents are settling into the idea that the current coronavirus outbreak will require many to take over for teachers and child care providers into the foreseeable future. On March 16, President Trump raised the possibility that the coronavirus crisis might last until August.  With schools across the country closed and unlikely to reopen soon, families are gathering teaching materials, setting up schedules, and looking for ways to keep kids engaged beyond the limited hours of remote-learning school days. Parents who are pros at packing lunches and juggling sports practices may feel overwhelmed at the thought of managing students\u2019 school days at home.  My own children started their school\u2019s remote-learning on March 16 and, even as an educator with 20 years of experience and two master\u2019s degrees in the education field, organizing their schedule consumed my morning. So, I decided to create a few resources to help families manage the sudden demand for at-home learning.  But first, take comfort in knowing that school-based lessons rarely go perfectly even for professional teachers. Kids struggle with instructions and get frustrated, no matter how well we prepare. Teachers spend much of their preparation time analyzing activities to improve the next lesson. As families step into teaching roles, it\u2019s crucial to treat inevitable missteps as learning opportunities. Trust me, this has already been a week of trial and error at my house.

It was the second time this week that an Israeli player in Turkey was dismissed over a message related to the Israel-Hamas war.  The player, Eden Karzev, a 23-year-old midfielder, was briefly questioned in Istanbul earlier this week after reposting an Instagram story that called for the release of the hostages, the private Demiroren news agency reported.

About 130 are still being held in Gaza; some of them are believed to be dead.  The Basaksehir club said in a statement on Thursday that it had fined Mr. Karzev and decided that his career should continue outside of Turkey.

The response was mostly enthusiastic, but a few readers were puzzled or even annoyed.  \u201cNow really out on the fringe,\u201d wrote Leading Edge Boomer of Santa Fe, N.M. \u201cWines like these are simply not going to be available in 95 percent of the country. Has this series run out of subject matter? Nevertheless, have a fine time, N.Y.C. people.\u201d  I empathize with Boomer. These wines are widely distributed, though not in Santa Fe, according to the useful website Wine-Searcher. I lament the lack of access. Boomer\u2019s complaint illustrates how much the world of wine has changed in the last 15 years, and how far it still has to go.  Image  Credit...Serge Bloch  Back in 2000, assyrtiko (pronounced ah-SEER-tee-koh) was indeed out on the fringe. But it\u2019s obscure no more, and it\u2019s hardly the property of an elite few big cities. It\u2019s available all around the country, with the exception of several states. That is not because assyrtiko is rare, but because of a ridiculously archaic American distribution system in which each state has its own rules and licensing requirements.  The availability of once-esoteric wines like assyrtiko makes this an exciting time in which to love wine. Yet the pace of change has been so rapid that many wine texts still reflect a narrower, 20th-century view of the world. Here at Wine School, we\u2019re not exactly rewriting the texts. But we are trying to take a comprehensive view of the fundamentally distinctive sorts of wine available today, regardless of whether they bear the seal of historical approval. Assyrtiko is a case in point. ", "  Letter  Feb. 3, 2015  To the Editor:  The New York State Assembly has a golden opportunity to introduce significant reform. As chairman of the Westchester County Board of Legislators, I offer these structural changes to make Albany more open and transparent:  First, establish a leadership term limit of two or three sessions. While voters in good faith support term limits, their focus is misdirected. General elections are the ultimate term limit; but voters have no say in legislative leadership, and this is where the true power resides. Speaker term limits will enable legislators to vote their constituents\u2019 interests without fear of punishment from leadership.  Second, introduce organizational bipartisanship in the Assembly. In Westchester, legislators of both parties are either in leadership or head a substantive committee. Under this structure, all legislators have \u201cskin in the game\u201d and an equal investment in a good outcome. Negotiation and compromise become the legislative currency, not simple and blind party discipline.  These suggestions apply to the State Senate as well, which has had an equally bad ethical track record. Moreover, neither party \u201cowns\u201d corruption.

Pixy, a drone camera, can help people take selfies without a selfie stick.Credit...Snap Inc.      April 28, 2022  Snap, the maker of the Snapchat messaging app, has long positioned itself as a camera company.  On Thursday, it unveiled a flying one. Called Pixy, the drone camera can help people take selfies without the aid of a selfie stick. Users hold the pocket-size camera in their palm and select a flight mode via a dial on the device\u2019s body. The gadget then flies for a minute, taking photos and videos that it downloads to the user\u2019s private Snapchat drive before landing back in the user\u2019s palm.  \u201cIt gives you a totally new perspective, actually allows you to have fun and go hang out with your family and create videos all together,\u201d Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview.  Pixy is Snap\u2019s first hardware product since Spectacles, which were glasses with embedded cameras and augmented-reality features. Spectacles debuted to hourslong lines in 2016 but ultimately underperformed. In 2021, Snap released a new version of Spectacles that let people see augmented-reality filters overlaid on the physical world.  Snap is selling Pixy for $229.99, with additional batteries for $19.99 and a dual battery charger for $49.99. The company said it planned to sell the camera \u201cwhile supplies last\u201d in the United States and France.  In 2020, Amazon also announced a flying camera, the $249 Ring Always Home Cam. The surveillance drone flies around its owner\u2019s home and records video, ostensibly for security purposes. It was immediately pilloried on social media as a privacy hazard. ", " Since then, almost nothing has gone as planned.  Progress in improving the country\u2019s inadequate roads, rail lines and ports has been slow. Corruption remains pernicious. Urban air pollution is even worse in India than in China, and could deteriorate further as more factories are built.  Plans to rewrite labor and land laws, and to overhaul state taxes, have stalled in Parliament. And an effort by Mr. Modi to bypass Parliament with temporary executive orders has run into trouble as well.  Mr. Modi\u2019s most controversial but potentially far-reaching executive order \u2014 making it easier to convert farmland into factory sites \u2014 expired on Aug. 31. He chose not to renew it. The ordinance had became a political liability in state elections, as farmers feared that it might be used to push them off their land.  \u201cEase of doing business is still a work in progress,\u201d said India\u2019s finance minister, Arun Jaitley, adding that state governments were starting to reform land and labor laws.  Yet slowly and a little unpredictably, India\u2019s manufacturing sector is starting to attract overseas investment.  Foxconn, the world\u2019s largest contract manufacturer of smartphones and other electronics, which has most of its factories in China, agreed in August to open 10 to 12 plants in western India by 2020, employing as many as 50,000 workers. A week earlier, General Motors announced plans to invest $1 billion to develop new car models for the Indian market and nearly double the size of its seven-year-old factory on the outskirts of Pune.  CNH Industrial of Italy is building an agricultural harvester factory nearby. Ford opened a sprawling car assembly plant in northwestern India this year, and Daimler has added an extensive assembly line for buses to its truck factory in southeastern India.

As the soon-to-be grandma shrieked: \u201cOh, my God. You\u2019re having a baby!\u201d the camera rolled.  Caryn and Bryan Canatella of Austin, Tex., went even further. Mr. Canatella volunteered to scan his mother-in-law\u2019s old family photographs for Christmas.  The couple then gathered her extended family, still dressed in holiday pajamas, to screen the compilation. Unbeknown to all, the video ended with a tease, \u201cAnd then there\u2019s more,\u201d followed by the audio of a heartbeat and a picture of Ms. Canatella\u2019s sonogram.

The video has been viewed three-quarters of a million times on YouTube. One Stripe or Two?  Not all pregnancy announcement videos focus on the happy moment of revelation. The current vogue extends all the way to the moment of discovery. An entire subspecies involves filming the pregnancy test \u2014 or at least the reading of the test.  One couple, Matt and April Fetch of Los Angeles, chronicled their five-year fertility struggle on YouTube, including a number of negative tests. In one video, Ms. Fetch displays her sad texts to her husband, then addresses the camera.  Her \u201cnatural intercourse cycle\u201d has not worked, she says holding the pregnancy test tube.

The upgrade, made to part of the collectively bargained benefits package, was unilaterally enacted by the union and unanimously approved by player representatives at their annual summit meeting in late June. The union was expected to make an announcement about the decision later this week.  Under the new plan, retired players who were part of the league for at least three years can obtain a coverage plan that includes medical, hospital and prescription drug benefits. Retired players with longer tenures can have access to additional benefits, including spousal coverage.  The cost to the union for the new plan, the details of which are still being finalized, is expected to fall between $12 million and $15 million per year, according to a person with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to publicly discuss the terms.  Michele Roberts, the executive director of the players\u2019 union, said in a telephone interview that current players had expected the substantial salary increases many have recently seen because of monumental television contracts signed by the N.B.A. two years ago. But the move to bolster health insurance for retirees, she said, had come up before those increases.

The money goes toward employee health-insurance premiums, of which the company pays 85 percent. It also helps cover the cost of weekly yoga classes for anyone in the local hospitality industry.

", " But the bigger story is Israel\u2019s importance to evangelical Christians.  \u201cChristian Zionism as a sentiment is not new,\u201d said Dan Senor, a Republican foreign policy adviser who has traveled to Israel with Mitt Romney, Chris Christie and other Republican candidates. \u201cBut as a movement, it has grown exponentially in size and political sophistication over the past 15 years.\u201d  In early 2013, when Obama nominated Chuck Hagel, a Republican, to become the next defense secretary, and Hagel\u2019s support for Israel was called into question, one of the groups lobbying against him in greatest number and at greatest volume was Christians United for Israel.  Its founder and chairman, John Hagee, was in Washington, D.C., with his wife last week at Netanyahu\u2019s speech. They were Adelson\u2019s guests.  Senor told me that in 2009, when he was promoting a book that he co-wrote, \u201cStart-Up Nation,\u201d about the modern Israeli economy, Christian radio shows extended as many invitations to him as Jewish groups did.  Some evangelical Christians\u2019 interest in Israel reflects an interpretation of the Bible\u2019s prophetic passages that\u2019s known as premillennial dispensationalism. It maintains that the End of Days can play out as God intends only if Jews govern Israel and have reconstructed a temple on the Temple Mount, where there\u2019s now a mosque.  But just a subset of evangelicals subscribe to that. Others are motivated by their belief, rooted in scripture, that God always intended Israel for Jews and that honoring that and keeping Israel safe is a way of honoring God. God\u2019s blessing of America, they feel, cannot be divorced from America\u2019s backing of Israel. ", " In the document, he said he would travel hours to Buffalo from the Southern Tier of New York.

The University of Iowa announced plans this week to remove Mr. Wynn\u2019s name from the school\u2019s Institute for Vision Research, which Mr. Wynn helped fund with a $25 million donation in 2013.

Ben Wasman, 19, a freshman, applauded the university for making what he called a \u201cbig statement\u201d recognizing the #MeToo movement.  \u201cNow that there\u2019s somebody directly affiliated with the university, with their name all over the place,\u201d he said, \u201cthey finally realize that change needs to be made, and we should probably go back and revoke Cosby\u2019s too.\u201d ", " Candidates embraced the gun-safety agenda this cycle to a degree not seen since at least the 2000 elections, when Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, made it key to his campaign messaging. According to Mark Kelly, who founded the gun-safety organization Americans for Responsible Solutions with his wife, the former House member Gabrielle Giffords, only four of 36 candidates listed on the Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cred to blue\u201d list in 2016 included the gun issue in their platforms. (The \u201cred to blue\u201d list refers to Republican-held seats Democrats hope to gain.) This year, 38 of 59 candidates on the list included the issue. Candidates for Congress and other offices around the country aggressively touted their support for stronger gun measures, in races in Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Virginia and elsewhere. Consider it no coincidence that many of these states suffered recent mass shootings.  Members of Congress, including ambitious ones like Tim Ryan, the Ohio Democrat who ran against Nancy Pelosi to be party leader in 2016, and Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, both had A ratings from the National Rifle Association. But both reversed course, trading their A for an N.R.A. F after recent mass shootings. In Pennsylvania\u2019s First Congressional District, representing Bucks and Montgomery Counties, both the Democratic and Republican candidates for Congress advertised their support for stronger gun laws, leading gun-safety forces to split their endorsements between the two (Brian Fitzpatrick, the incumbent Republican, won narrowly).  Part of the appeal of the gun-safety issue arises from its resonance with women, for whom gun violence is a top concern, and who constituted a key swing constituency. According to a survey conducted by the Y.W.C.A., a top tier of personal concerns among women includes \u201ckeeping their families safe from gun violence.\u201d ", " Facebook confirmed the military\u2019s involvement, and it took down the accounts in August.

But deadlock threatened to become crisis at the coming meeting.  One of the biggest sticking points: avoiding the creation of a physical border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. We surveyed their winding open frontier, where signs of the island\u2019s sectarian strife are still visible, like the mural above, in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, which nationalists refer to as Derry.

And does that make the case potentially more easy for them to prosecute? Potentially. And so I think, obviously, a successful prosecution would probably bolster the argument for holding more adults responsible, but ultimately, juries make decisions based on facts and details that are always changing and specific to particular cases. And so I think we\u2019re really going to have to wait and see how the individual facts of this case play out, and ultimately what a judge or jury decides. michael barbaro      But on the other side, I\u2019m betting there are Second Amendment rights advocates who view this very differently, and will think that this prosecution shouldn\u2019t become a model around the country because it would represent a slippery slope. Perhaps the argument goes something like this. If parents are being charged, as they are in this case, for what their kid does with a gun that they facilitated the purchase of, what\u2019s to stop prosecutors from charging parents if they bought liquor for their kids and their kids get into an accident because they\u2019re drunk and they kill people, or if their kid uses a hunting knife that they bought them specifically for hunting to stab someone to death? Will the parents be held responsible for more and more things in our society, as the parents in this case are being held responsible for what their son did? ", " So the appointment of Mr. Sunak, an experienced former chancellor of the Exchequer, might reassure financial markets enough to give a new government more leeway when it devises a new budget plan.  Ms. Mordaunt, who finished third in the summer leadership contest, has good communication skills and has raised her profile in recent weeks, including this week when she appeared in Parliament to defend the government. Her supporters argue that she might be the best placed of the possible contenders to manage a fractured Conservative Party.  \u201cPenny is the best candidate to unite our party and lead our great nation,\u201d said Bob Seely, one of her supporters and a member of Parliament.

Especially because Kim Kardashian actually modeled a packing tape look in the audience \u2014 an outfit (can you even call it that?) she said had taken four Balenciaga assistants half an hour to create. Not only did the tape make sticky, squeaky sounds as she walked, but Ms. Kardashian was, she professed, worried that when she sat down some sections might rip apart.

According to studies, \u201cmost people in the world believe in some sort of afterlife, even those who have no specific religious affiliation,\u201d said Elena Pakhoutova, senior curator of Himalayan art and the organizer of \u201cDeath Is Not the End\u201d at the Rubin Museum of Art in Manhattan.  Objects reflecting those convictions may be especially comforting because of the Covid-19 pandemic, whose arrival subtly reshaped \u2014 and often postponed \u2014 the plans for these shows. The Rubin, for instance, has made \u201cDeath Is Not the End\u201d part of \u201cLife After,\u201d a thematic focus for 2023. On view through Jan. 14, the exhibition examines attitudes toward mortality in both Tibetan Buddhism (the museum\u2019s specialty) and Christianity. ", " In 2015, he helped write legislation that overhauled the No Child Left Behind Act, transferring some authority from the federal government to the states and reducing the use of standardized tests to evaluate students and teachers.  He has supported expanding Pell Grants and is a co-sponsor of the Finish Act, which would provide funding for colleges and universities to \u201cincrease access to higher education for high-need students, increase degree attainment and improve efficiency in our higher education systems.\u201d  In materials provided to The New York Times, his campaign did not make any concrete education proposals but said Mr. Bennet would work to ensure that \u201ccollege students can pursue their studies without incurring the crushing burden of debt; more people seeking an alternative to college can pursue high-quality apprenticeships and job training; and Americans throughout their lives can advance their careers by improving their existing job skills or learning new ones.\u201d Climate change  Mr. Bennet is in line with the rest of the Democratic field in calling for recommitting to the Paris Agreement and preserving Obama-era climate regulations that Mr. Trump is reversing. He has also supported regulating methane emissions and creating a standardized metric for the federal government to measure the cost of greenhouse gas emissions.  In March, he helped create the Senate Special Committee on the Climate Crisis, and last month, he was co-sponsor of a bipartisan bill that would provide tax incentives for energy storage.  In other areas, though, he has diverged from the party\u2019s left wing. In a USA Today op-ed essay in 2017, he said some Democrats had played into Republicans\u2019 portrait of them as \u201cjob killers fundamentally out of touch with most Americans.\u201d ", " Adding this up, you can see how the let-them-choose approach could lead to a diversity crisis: Single young men who generally opt to go into the office five days a week could rocket up the firm while employees with young children, particularly women, prefer to work from home and are held back.  Remote work can be a huge benefit for firms and employees, but should be centrally organized so everyone within the same team is in the office on the same days. This is how working from home will work out.  Image The elements of teamwork  To better understand how teams can best work together online and in person, the Harvard researchers Ashley Whillans, Leslie Perlow and Aurora Turek interviewed employees at a consulting firm as it adapted to remote work during the pandemic. The researchers used what they learned to define categories of team interactions, which companies can consider when deciding how to structure work \u2014 regardless of where it happens.  Content interactions: communication about tasks, such as sharing feedback while sitting side by side. When work went virtual, more of these interactions took place asynchronously, through digital work tools such as Slack. One manager said communication had improved because individuals had more time to think.  Bounce interactions: new idea generation, as with an impromptu whiteboard brainstorming session. In the virtual version, individuals often generated ideas on their own, and then they and others emailed them back and forth. That made it harder to align with others; some teams adjusted by moving brainstorming sessions to videoconferences. ", " Image  HELLO, JORDAN John Boyer\u2019s video appeal to King Abdullah II.  Takeaway lesson: Think of geography as physical and cultural attributes of a country, from vegetation and terrain to language and religion, that influence current events. The unrest in Ukraine, Mr. Boyer says, has been a decades-long battle over which neighbor to align with: Russia or Europe. Check out maps showing linguistic, ethnic and voting distributions and you\u2019ll see a sharp east (pro-Russian) versus west (pro-European) divide. Seeds of the current conflict were sewn during the 2004 election when the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych defeated the pro-European Viktor Yushchenko. The election was believed corrupted by voter fraud, spurring protests and a redo that resulted in a victory for Mr. Yushchenko, but in 2010 Mr. Yanukovych won. \u201cGeography affects everything,\u201d Mr. Boyer says.

It\u2019s that they don\u2019t notice the way she does. Do students, for example, spot the way a cow fixates on that streak of sunlight? Usually not, she says. Born with autism and a savant-like command of visual details, Dr. Grandin teaches a course that focuses on cattle, but with more than half of students heading to nonranch work, she instills skills that translate: \u201cI want to teach them how to be better observers.\u201d  For one class, students visit a cattle ranch and then design a corral system for 200 cattle and a slaughterhouse that shows an understanding of animal behavior and that accounts for site restrictions like roads, buildings and streams. \u201cI say, \u2018Even if you never design anything with livestock, this is visual problem-solving.\u2019 \u201d ", " But recently, criminals\u2019 techniques have evolved. At the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a former official said there had been instances where criminals had managed to physically implant malicious code into point-of-sale systems on the factory floor. In most cases, however, criminals installed the malware remotely after breaking into an organization through other means.  This time, the code the criminals instructed Target\u2019s registers to send customer data back to the infected Target server once every hour, on the hour, and to cover its own tracks. After siphoning the data back to the infected server, the malicious code immediately deleted the file where it had been stored, so there was no memory of it, according to iSight Partners, a security firm currently working with the Secret Service to investigate the attacks.  The malware, known as a memory scraper, has been coined \u201cKaptoxa\u201d after a word in its code \u2014 Kaptoxa is Russian slang for \u201cpotato\u201d and is often used by underground criminals to refer to credit cards. Its developers ensured the code would evade regular antivirus products \u2014 even a month after Target\u2019s breach was made public most antivirus products still fail to catch it. To avoid setting off any alarms, the criminals waited six days after moving the data from the infected server to a web server that was itself infected with malware, and from there to a server in Russia that served as a proxy to mask the criminals\u2019 true whereabouts, according to Aviv Raff, the chief technology officer at Seculert, a security company headquartered in Israel that has been investigating the malware used on Target\u2019s systems.

With the latter, she sought to create a warm, elevated space for people to come together \u2014 \u201ccommunity is such a big part of the brand,\u201d says Posada. Drawing inspiration from storied European establishments like Caf\u00e9 Einstein in Berlin and Caf\u00e9 Central in Vienna, she opted for a bruised Calacatta Viola marble counter, dark walnut paneling on the walls and a hand-cut gray-green and creamy white marble mosaic floor. Posada also included personal touches, such as black-and-white photos of Santis\u2019s Greek family: his parents on a date (chaperoned by his grandmother), his grandmother on a road trip with her cousins in the \u201950s.

", "The case for reopening  For business owners and state officials, the case is clear: just look at the numbers.  On Feb. 25, New York City had a seven-day average of 4,043 cases per day, according to data from the city. This week that number has dipped to an average of less than 2,700. There\u2019s been a similar decline in new hospitalizations: to a seven-day average of 178 per day this week, from an average of 326 in late February.  These dips have occurred in the weeks since the governor reopened more businesses in the city, like movie theaters, expanded indoor dining to 35 percent capacity and began allowing a limited amount of people to attend professional sporting events.  \u201cAs the governor has said, we see reopening as a series of valves, and if the reality on the ground changes, we will take swift action to tighten up restrictions,\u201d said Jack Sterne, a spokesman for the governor.

", " Those types of public coverage expansions tend to be politically divisive in Washington. They often draw fierce opposition from the health care industry for the same reason supporters like the policy: They would be disruptive, and significantly reduce fees paid to hospitals and doctors.  A Kaiser Family Foundation report this week estimated that total health spending for those with private insurance would decline by $350 billion in a year if those private plans paid claims at Medicare rates.  \u201cYou can\u2019t take $350 billion from a system and expect it to look exactly the same,\u201d said Ms. Schwartz, an author of the report. \u201cEvery time I drive past a hospital, I see a big construction project. You\u2019d probably see less of that.\u201d  In coming years, Democrats will probably confront more decisions about how to expand coverage. The new Affordable Care Act subsidies expire at the end of 2022, setting up a figurative cliff in which premiums would go back up if Congress did not act.  Democrats could use the moment to make those changes permanent, further solidifying the role of private health insurance. If enrollees find themselves satisfied with their increasingly subsidized plans \u2014 if they perceive the coverage as more affordable because the government pays a bigger share of the tab \u2014 the urgency to expand public coverage may lessen.  \u201cSometimes the path of least resistance is self-reinforcing,\u201d said Jacob Hacker, a political scientist at Yale who helped develop the public option plan supported by Mr. Biden.  But legislators could find themselves balking at the price tag. Making the subsidy permanent would most likely cost hundreds of billions. That could push the party to think about the cheaper but more politically challenging route of expanding public plans. ", " Image  Mr. Yang has proposed monthly payments of $1,000 for every American from age 18 to 64. \u201cI\u2019m a capitalist,\u201d he said, \u201cand I believe that universal basic income is necessary for capitalism to continue.\u201dCredit...Guerin Blask for The New York Times  Mr. Yang\u2019s skepticism of technology extends beyond factory robots. In his campaign book, \u201cThe War on Normal People,\u201d he writes that he wants to establish a Department of the Attention Economy in order to regulate social media companies like Facebook and Twitter. He also proposes appointing a cabinet-level secretary of technology, based in Silicon Valley, to study the effects of emerging technologies.  Critics may dismiss Mr. Yang\u2019s campaign (slogan: \u201cHumanity First\u201d) as a futurist vanity stunt. The Democratic pipeline is already stuffed with would-be 2020 contenders, most of whom already have the public profile and political experience that Mr. Yang lacks \u2014 and at least one of whom, Senator Bernie Sanders, has already hinted at support for a universal basic income.  Opponents of universal basic income have also pointed to its steep price tag \u2014 an annual outlay of $12,000 per American adult would cost approximately $2 trillion, equivalent to roughly half of the current federal budget \u2014 and the possibility that giving out free money could encourage people not to work. These reasons, among others, are why Hillary Clinton, who considered adding universal basic income to her 2016 platform, concluded it was \u201cexciting but not realistic.\u201d  \u201cIn our political culture, there are formidable political obstacles to providing cash to working-age people who aren\u2019t employed, and it\u2019s unlikely that U.B.I. could surmount them,\u201d Robert Greenstein, the president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group, wrote last year. ", " As the recession roiled the market, one-bedrooms encountered strong headwinds; many of the first-time buyers drawn to these starter apartments were unable to get loans, which caused units to linger and dip in price. Since then, in the last couple of years, as the housing and lending markets have improved, one-bedrooms have practically flown off the shelves. Sales, in fact, made up about 41 percent of all deals in the fourth quarter of 2013, according to the Miller Samuel appraisal firm; the quarterly showing was the strongest since 1997, when they represented about 43 percent off all deals.  Given that one-bedrooms constitute such a large portion of the market, one might think developers would want to build more of them. But many developers have had to shell out more for land purchases \u2014 in Manhattan, prime lots can cost around $850 a square foot \u2014 so there is often pressure to build the larger, more expensive units, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel.  \u201cIt\u2019s not that there is no demand for one-bedrooms,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s that there is no demand for one-bedrooms at $4,000 a foot, which would make some of these sites feasible.\u201d  The market share of one-bedroom sales is expected to drop further in 2014 as new multi-bedroom products begin to work their way through the system.  The list of condominiums with few one-bedrooms is long and splashy. Walker Tower, the conversion of a former telephone building in Chelsea, on West 18th Street, had just three one-bedrooms out of 53 units. Closings there began in November. ", " Mr. Paddock had complained to friends of feeling ill, in pain and fatigued, according to a preliminary report on the police investigation released last month. Mr. Paddock\u2019s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, told investigators that he had grown more distant over the year before the shooting. The law enforcement report described Mr. Paddock as \u201cgermaphobic\u201d and strongly reactive to smells.  A primary care physician in Las Vegas \u2014 who said he had been Mr. Paddock\u2019s doctor since 2009 and had last seen him as a patient roughly a year before the shooting \u2014 told officials that he suspected Mr. Paddock had bipolar disorder. That psychological disorder, however, cannot be identified in a typical post-mortem examination of brain structures. And while some studies have shown that people with bipolar disorder are more likely to have a history of violent behavior than the general public, the majority of them do not, and the relationship between mental health and violence involves many other factors.  The doctor, who was not named in the report, also described Mr. Paddock as having behaved oddly, showing little emotion and expressing fear of medications. Mr. Paddock had refused prescriptions for antidepressants, but the physician had prescribed anti-anxiety medicine for him.  A toxicology report showed he did have anti-anxiety medication in his system, based on a test of his urine. It was no longer detectable in his blood, meaning it was not active. The autopsy, performed by the Clark County coroner, and its related reports were obtained by The New York Times on Friday, and were first reported on by The Las Vegas Review-Journal, which had gone to court with The Associated Press to secure their release.

", " Mr. McConnell, a chief Republican proponent of sending more aid to Ukraine, has been a vocal supporter of the border deal that members of his party have insisted upon as the price of their backing for continued assistance for Kyiv.  The bipartisan team of senators that has been working for months to strike a compromise to crack down on rampant migration and drug trafficking across the southern border with Mexico has come to an agreement in recent days on a set of policy changes. They include measures to make it more difficult to secure asylum and increase detention facilities.  The deal would also increase the number of available visas by 250,000, including many that would be green-card eligible, and set a goal of screening asylum cases within 90 days.  The group has not yet agreed on how much money to devote to the effort.  Many Republicans are upset that the deal does not include a specific restriction on parole, the administration\u2019s authority to let migrants not otherwise legally authorized to enter the country live and work in the United States on a temporary basis. In his letter on Friday, Mr. Johnson repeated his demand for more restrictive changes, such as placing strict limits on parole and reviving the Trump-era \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy that forced migrants who could not be kept in detention facilities to wait outside the United States until their court dates.  And some Republican opponents of the border compromise have questioned the wisdom of bothering to consider it in the Senate if their counterparts in the House are determined to block or kill it.

His daughter\u2019s former husband, a real estate investor also from South Florida, had agreed to act as one of five people guaranteeing the bail package, although none were present in court.  Calling the risk of Mr. Hawit\u2019s fleeing to his native Honduras \u201csubstantial,\u201d prosecutors requested a bail amount of $4 million. His lawyer called that amount \u201cunattainable,\u201d adding that his client and his family did not have high net worths.  Properties in Honduras owned by Mr. Hawit, his lawyer said, had mortgages on them, and the house in which he lives is in his wife\u2019s name. Some of the bribe money that prosecutors say was paid to Mr. Hawit was wired to a Panamanian bank account also in the name of Mr. Hawit\u2019s wife.  Mr. Hawit was the fifth defendant to be extradited to the United States from Zurich, where FIFA is headquartered and where several top officials were arrested in May and December while gathered for meetings.  Three defendants in the case remain in a Swiss jail, resisting American efforts to bring them to Brooklyn. Switzerland chose to extradite another defendant, Eugenio Figueredo, to his home country, Uruguay, rather than the United States.

", " Nationally, the Dairy Farmers of America, the largest dairy co-op in the United States, has diverted almost a quarter of a million gallons of milk to food banks.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a drop in the bucket,\u201d said Jackie Klippenstein, a senior vice president at the co-op. \u201cBut we had to do something.\u201d  The closure of restaurants, hotels and school cafeterias wiped out huge sources of demand for fresh food, leaving farmers with millions of pounds of excess. While increased sales at grocery stores have made up for some of that, not since the Great Depression has so much fresh food been destroyed. (In the 1930s, the problem was that people could not afford to buy all the crops farmers were producing, which led the federal government to establish an early food stamp program.)  The Agriculture Department grants are expected to be announced this week, but farmers say their losses far exceed what the grants can provide.  \u201cThese are not insolvable problems,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a food studies professor at New York University. \u201cThese are problems that require a lot of people, sums of money and some thought. If the government were really interested in making sure that hungry people got fed and farmers were supported, they would figure out a way to do it.\u201d  There are some signs that the waste is starting to dissipate. At the beginning of April, farmers were dumping 3.7 million gallons of milk each day, draining it into manure pits, where it mixed with fertilizer used in the fields. Now, the waste is closer to 1.5 million gallons, according to the dairy co-op, as farmers scale back production and restaurant chains like Papa John\u2019s heed the industry\u2019s call to add extra cheese to every pizza.

King Charles III has been admitted to a London hospital for a procedure to treat an enlarged prostate, Buckingham Palace confirmed on Friday.  News images showed Charles arriving around 9 a.m. at the London Clinic, a private hospital, where his daughter-in-law Catherine, Princess of Wales, is recovering from abdominal surgery.  The palace announced the king\u2019s pending treatment last week shortly after the news that Catherine, Prince William\u2019s wife, had undergone surgery in London. Her office in Kensington Palace said she would remain in the hospital for 10 to 14 days to recover.  The king\u2019s recovery is expected to be much swifter, though the palace did not say how long he was expected to stay in the hospital. Charles, who was seen entering the hospital with his wife, Queen Camilla, visited Catherine before undergoing his own procedure, according to a palace official.  By announcing his elective prostate procedure in advance, the palace said, Charles, 75, hoped to encourage other men with similar symptoms to get checked.  \u201cThe king was this morning admitted to a London hospital for scheduled treatment,\u201d the palace said in a statement. \u201cHis Majesty would like to thank all those who sent their good wishes over the past week, and is delighted to learn the diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness.\u201d ", " A city permit allows mobile vendors to sell anywhere within the city. At a franchise operation like Mister Softee, routes are assigned by the depot manager so that drivers for the same company do not trip over one another.  But, Mr. Bouziotis said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to push anyone\u201d to sell ice cream where they feel endangered.  Bad blood has run through the New York ice cream trade for decades. In 1969, a Mister Softee driver was kidnapped by rivals who blew up his truck. In 2004, a cone-selling couple in their 60s were ambushed by competitors who beat them into critical condition with a wrench. In a 2010 brawl caught on video, two drivers near Columbus Circle exchanged punches before one man pushed the other\u2019s face into a planter.  But drivers for Mister Softee, whose cone-headed, bowtied likeness adorns more than 350 trucks across the five boroughs, can play hard, too.  In 2012, a frozen yogurt vendor said that a Softee duo snapped his brakes with a crowbar, and the founder of the Van Leeuwen ice cream company said he had gotten death threats from Softee drivers. (A lawyer for Mister Softee, Jeffrey Zucker, said that while he had not heard about the 2012 allegations, \u201ca franchisee could lose his or her Mister Softee franchise for engaging in that type of criminal activity.\u201d)  \u201cLet me tell you about this business,\u201d Adam Vega, a thickly muscled, heavily tattooed Mister Softee man who works the upper reaches of the Upper East Side and East Harlem, said on Wednesday. \u201cEvery truck has a bat inside.\u201d ", " \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the administration can and should continue to push for reduced civilian casualties and more humanitarian assistance,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cBut right now, Israel is locked in a life-or-death struggle against a terrorist organization sworn to annihilate it and the Jewish people, and I believe we must maintain both military and humanitarian assistance.\u201d  It is not yet clear whether either Mr. Kaine\u2019s or Mr. Van Hollen\u2019s proposals will receive votes, as the national security spending bill remains stalled while the border security negotiations drag on.

", " The new round of charges does not center on Mr. Parnas\u2019s work overseas with Mr. Giuliani, but on the start-up, Fraud Guarantee, and additional allegations of campaign finance crimes. Still, coming less than two months before the presidential election, the new charges recall a damaging incident in Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure.  Prosecutors said Mr. Parnas persuaded an array of investors to pump more than $2 million into the company, which was intended to offer an insurance-like product to protect consumers. But Fraud Guarantee never got off the ground.  \u201cWe couldn\u2019t say it better ourselves \u2014 the behavior alleged today is indeed fraudulent \u2014 guaranteed,\u201d William F. Sweeney, the head of the New York F.B.I. office, said in a news release announcing the charges with the acting United States attorney, Audrey Strauss.  Mr. Parnas, 48, and his partner in the venture, David Correia, were charged with wire fraud conspiracy.  Mr. Parnas\u2019s attorney, Joseph A. Bondy, said his client was pleased the case could now move forward. \u201cLev Parnas has been on strict home confinement for nearly one year, waiting for this superseding indictment, which contains no surprises,\u201d he said.  Lawyers for Mr. Correia and the two other defendants declined to comment.  Mr. Parnas was a regular presence in Trump donor circles before the first indictment last year, which heightened scrutiny of his dealings with Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Giuliani played a central role in a dirt-digging campaign aimed at Mr. Trump\u2019s political rivals that led to the president\u2019s impeachment last year.

After hearing about the cremation service Celestis Memorial Spaceflight\u2019s plans to send human cremains to the moon aboard Peregrine, the Navajo Nation president, Buu Nygren, wrote to the NASA administrator Bill Nelson and other officials on Dec. 21 asking to delay the launch. The Navajo people revere the moon as a spiritually important object.  \u201cThe act of depositing human remains and other materials, which could be perceived as discards in any other location, on the moon is tantamount to desecration of this sacred space,\u201d Mr. Nygren wrote.  The Navajo president\u2019s protest offers an example of how use of the moon, even for the most well-intentioned purposes, requires a collaborative and deliberate approach. The moon belongs to everyone, which means it belongs to no one; use of the moon by anyone demands consideration of everyone. Lunar landings scheduled for 2024 and 2025 under the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program include a water-hunting robot, a navigation system that works like a GPS device, instruments to probe the moon\u2019s interior and sample containers that will collect lunar soil.

She was clad in a typically outlandish Lacroix silhouette when Brocklehurst arrived for tea and demanded to be allowed to sketch her. Bricknall recalls an invigorating difference between the two drawings: In Barnes\u2019s depiction, Bricknall is a perfectly elegant foil for the clothes. Brocklehurst, by contrast, focused on the woman within the garments, and left Bricknall looking not a little deranged.

The Puppy Collective, as they were known, had occupied a building near her West Hampstead studio, and Brocklehurst persuaded them to sit for her: singly, in pairs and in various states of undress. Likenesses of Siouxsie Sioux and Billy Idol appear alongside a host of bright-haired, gender-indifferent rebels. Bricknall\u2019s roommate Iggy is portrayed with a vertical crimson mane (above), dressed in a shredded black singlet and \u2018No Future\u2019 pants, cockily examining his own likeness in the mirror like a punk Narcissus.  Over the coming decades, Brocklehurst became enmeshed in the inventive fetish scene that blossomed in London in the 1990s, and which likewise attracted the attention of designers such as Thierry Mugler and Jean Paul Gaultier. She had a horror of being pigeonholed by anything so irrelevant as age, keeping her own a fiercely guarded secret. From the early 1990s onwards, Brocklehurst\u2019s public appearances would be undertaken in a bobbed blonde wig, with a number of pairs of outsized sunglasses or spectacles stacked up her forehead and shielding her face from view.

But some companies that hired remote workers during the pandemic say going back to the office isn\u2019t an option. Remote work made more normal by the pandemic has altered how companies operate, especially when it comes to hiring. Tech companies outside Silicon Valley have been able to grow because their talent pool has expanded.  Take, for instance, Craig Fuller, the founder of a logistics data analytics company in Chattanooga, Tenn., who is used to recruiting software engineers and data experts who live outside the area. In the past, that meant making a case for why they should move to the midsize Southern city. He would emphasize the low cost of living and outdoor community: \u201cWe look for people who have families,\u201d he said.  But during the past two years, these sorts of conversations have been unnecessary. Mr. Fuller\u2019s company, FreightWaves, has doubled the size of its staff by expanding remote work. And of its 120 new hires, about 60 percent live outside Chattanooga. ", " But voting by mail shouldn\u2019t be viewed as partisan. During this pandemic, it\u2019s the best way to enable participation in the election while protecting public health.  If older or immuno-compromised Americans face higher illness risks from voting in person, some may weigh the cost and not vote. (Incidentally, older Americans were more likely to vote Republican than Democratic in 2018.) A mail-in option will remove barriers to voting \u2014 barriers we\u2019ve overcome living far from our home districts, while our spouses serve in the military.  Some who oppose vote-by-mail fear that it will lead to widespread voter fraud. But not only is all voter fraud extremely rare, but the five states with almost universal vote-by-mail report very little fraud. That is because Republican and Democratic state leaders have determined safeguards to protect the integrity of their ballots \u2014 including comprehensive audits, thorough crosschecks and bar codes.  Others say that vote-by-mail improves outcomes for Democrats, but that\u2019s not always true. Mail-in ballots in Florida arguably helped elect President George W. Bush, a Republican, in 2000. Moreover, many red states have expanded vote-by-mail in recent years. And even in blue states, as the Republican consultant Rob Stutzman has argued, vote-by-mail has helped the G.O.P.  At very least, if there are any advantages for Democrats or Republicans, studies show these tend to cancel each other out.  Our national, state, and local leaders should resist partisan fear-mongering and support expanding vote-by-mail. If people who put their lives on the line to protect our democracy can agree that no substantial threat is posed by this practice, then politicians, too, should find common ground.

A spinoff would be the latest chapter in a long and often fraught relationship between the Porsche family and Volkswagen. Credit...Felix Schmitt for The New York Times      Feb. 22, 2022  Volkswagen said it was considering hiving off its profitable Porsche division into a separate company with its own stock listing. The transaction would help the automaker raise money to invest in electric vehicles while also potentially returning more control of the high-performance carmaker to descendants of its founder.  Volkswagen preferred shares, the most widely traded, soared 9 percent Tuesday after the company said it had negotiated a \u201cframework agreement\u201d with Porsche Automobil Holding, the investment vehicle for descendants of Ferdinand Porsche, who founded the company in the 1930s.  The holding company, which owns 51 percent of Volkswagen\u2019s voting shares, said in a statement that it might acquire shares in an independent Porsche carmaker as part of the transaction. If so, the family could trade shares in Volkswagen, one of the world\u2019s largest carmakers, for a greater share of Porsche, which supplies a third of the parent company\u2019s profits.  The transaction would require approval by Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board and could be vetoed by the State of Lower Saxony, which has two seats on the 20-person board, and Volkswagen workers, who have 10 seats. The transaction would generate cash that Volkswagen could use to manage a costly transition to electric vehicles, but it would also reduce the company\u2019s share of Porsche\u2019s profits. Volkswagen is likely to retain a stake in Porsche, though its exact size is not yet clear.

He even thought he could eventually lead the team to its first World Series title.  On Friday, with Rodr\u00edguez in the middle of a rookie season in which he was already an All-Star, shined at the Home Run Derby and will most likely win the American League\u2019s Rookie of the Year Award, he agreed to a contract extension that matches his ambition, with an expected $210 million guaranteed and the possibility of the deal reaching $470 million, which would be the largest total value contract in baseball history.  The contract extension was confirmed by team on Friday night. The details of the deal, which were confirmed by a person familiar with the negotiations who was not authorized to discuss it publicly, are wildly complicated. It starts with an eight-year deal for $120 million that will run from this season through 2029, at which point there will be multiple team options that range widely in length and value depending on certain benchmarks \u2014 the most extreme of which would add 10 years and $350 million to the original deal.

The limit on payouts carries a stigma, but it could have been worse. Morgan Stanley\u2019s planned $6.8 billion distribution to shareholders after this year\u2019s stress test is close to what it planned after last year\u2019s. Goldman\u2019s planned payout for this year, $6.3 billion, is lower than last year\u2019s request of around $9.9 billion. But it\u2019s important to note that Goldman has paid out only roughly $5.7 billion of last year\u2019s sum.  One reason the Fed did not object to the two firms\u2019 capital plans is that, although their payouts would have taken their capital below minimum requirements in the stress tests, there were mitigating circumstances. The two banks\u2019 results were negatively affected by the recent tax bill enacted by Congress. Adapting to the new law, which meant doing things like repatriating money from abroad, caused losses at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs that depleted their capital going into the stress tests. Because of the one-time nature of the losses, and the fact that the tax cuts will bolster earnings over time, the Fed did not object to the two banks\u2019 plans.  Even so, it appears that Morgan Stanley had to reduce its plan by around $1.9 billion and Goldman Sachs by roughly $1.2 billion, according to calculations by The New York Times. Deutsche Bank is still in the doghouse  The giant German lender has had years to try to mend the problems affecting its American businesses before they were subject to the Fed\u2019s stress tests. But the Fed does not appear to be seeing sufficient improvement.

Anyone who saw the troupe\u2019s American debut at the Fall for Dance festival in 2010, or caught its visit to Montclair State University in New Jersey in 2011, already knows why. \u201cID: Entidades,\u201d a signature work on those programs, is one of two pieces being presented at the Joyce as part of the theater\u2019s four-company festival of Brazilian dance. The return of the work reveals another rare aspect: It rewards repeat viewings.  \u201cID: Entidades\u201d (2009) is neither a bag of tricks nor a bloodless abstraction. Classic hip-hop moves are visible \u2014 the rippling of arms, the rolling on backs \u2014 yet they have been stretched and shaped into something new. Occasionally and briefly, the eight dancers face front and sync to a beat, but the rhythms of most phrases have been pulled apart and inflated with breath.

Since Monday, when baseball began enforcing stricter guidelines on ball-doctoring, pitchers on their way back to the dugout have occasionally been intercepted by umpires. As part of M.L.B.\u2019s crackdown on sticky stuff on the balls pitchers throw, they have been asked to submit for inspection their hats, gloves, fingers and, if requested, more. (At least one has dropped his pants in frustration.) If any illegal substances are found, the new policy calls for an immediate ejection and 10-game suspension.  Of course, any gripping agents beyond rosin have long been against baseball\u2019s rules. But M.L.B. had largely turned a blind eye to the issue, allowing concoctions made of things like pine tar or rosin mixed with sunscreen that, pitchers said, made it easier for them to better grasp a ball that has been particularly inconsistent in recent seasons. In recent seasons, though, that practice had morphed into a performance enhancer, according to M.L.B., thanks to super pastes or other substances being used to not only improve the grip but increase the spin, and thus the movement, of pitches.

At the time, Mr. Singer was working for the Louisiana Capital Assistance Center, an organization that provides free representation to defendants in Louisiana death penalty cases.  The only physical evidence tying Mr. Verret to the crime was the victim\u2019s blood on the washing machine. In early 2018, while reviewing the DNA documentation from the Acadiana Criminalistics Laboratory in New Iberia, La., Mr. Singer spotted some peculiarities. One, the tests to confirm that the stain on the washing machine was blood were marked as both negative and inconclusive. Stranger yet, though an analyst tested the knife supposedly used to kill Mr. Poche at the same time as the washing machine swab, Mr. Singer could not find results for the knife.  Several subpoenas of the lab failed to produce the missing material. He did not get the full report until January, three years after the knife was tested, he said.

It implies that the overall turnout among young Hispanic voters was actually higher than among Hispanic voters over age 29.  That\u2019s unlikely given the consistent Census Bureau finding that the turnout among young Hispanic voters is extremely low. In 2012, just 34 percent of 18-to-24-year-old Hispanic citizens voted, compared with the much higher turnout rate (no less than 47 percent) among every older group. The low registration rate implied by the L2 data is consistent with the census data.  Perhaps the youth Hispanic turnout really did surge. But it seems more likely to be statistical noise in a small sample. The entrance-exit polls found much lower turnout among young Hispanic voters in 2008, so there is not much reason to assume that caucus electorates are especially likely to draw young Hispanic voters. The entrance-exit polls do not weight the sample by Hispanic origin, so it cannot correct for the possibility that young Hispanic voters were particularly likely to respond \u2014 whether just by chance or because of an underlying bias.  The high number of young Hispanic voters is the second smoking gun in the data. On Sunday, I noted the other key piece of evidence: how the entrance-exit poll showed Mrs. Clinton leading by just five percentage points in Clark County \u2014 the county where the preponderance of Hispanic voters live. She actually won by 10 percent (although it should be noted that vote and delegate shares aren\u2019t necessarily the same).

But the mistake that Mr. Trump has stumbled into lately \u2014 in full force this week \u2014 has been to be direct. Instead of the obnoxious feints and ugly insinuations that have worked so well for him on Twitter, driving his detractors nuts, he has been abandoning the implicit for the explicit, thus making statements that are demonstrably untrue.  In the past, he could slip out of some of his tweets by pretending he was joking. Less so, now. When he tweets lies like \u201cRIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!\u201d, as he did on Sunday, they are verifiably false.  He\u2019s showing not only that the emperor has no clothes, but that he looks pretty bad naked.

Some consider the labels ineffectual, yet they are having a cumulative effect, revealing that his spewing has been a big bunch of nonsense.  The question remains whether the effect of labeling Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets will filter down to his most vehement followers, who lap up whatever he is peddling with gusto.

But one coin, a 10-cent piece known as a dinero, stood out.  The dinero was marked \u201c1899.\u201d The problem was that official records indicated no coins of that denomination were minted in Peru that year \u2014 according to the people who made the money, the coin never existed.

", " Hispanic origin is counted as an ethnicity, and is a distinct category from race. But Hispanics can also check race boxes.  Richard Alba, a sociologist who has studied demographics and the fluidity of racial categories, said the rise in multiracial Americans was a logical extension of the substantial mixing that has been happening for years in the United States.  Among Asians and Hispanics, more than a quarter marry outside their race, according to the Pew Research Center. For American-born Asians, the share is nearly double that.  The jump in the multirace category is partly to do with the Census Bureau collecting more detailed data, Professor Alba said, and analyzing answers more deeply. He said he believed that part of the decrease in the white population was people switching from the category of white to the category of more than one race.  \u201cThe census is doing a much better job at reflecting the growing complexity of the population,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are really trying to acknowledge that the world is changing out there.\u201d  Image Participants in the Vietnamese New Year Festival at the Greater Austin Merchants Cooperative Association in Austin, Texas.

What was South Central like before crack hit?  A. No bars on the windows. Not a lot of people fenced in their homes. A lot more kids played in the street. You could go to different neighborhoods, make friends in different neighborhoods. Then once this went down, it was just totally different. It wasn\u2019t about going into Watts and hanging out with some friends because, you know, they were in business. It became about business.  What misconceptions do people have about the crack epidemic?  The biggest misconception is that the urban population came up with the idea for crack. It wasn\u2019t something that started in the urban community. But they were the most affected by it.  How do those effects linger today?  A whole generation of people went to prison. A whole generation of people died chasing money. The trade was basically a war on the streets for many, many years.

Paul Detterman, national director of The Fellowship Community, a group of conservatives who have stayed in the church, said: \u201cOur objection to the passage of the marriage amendment is in no way, shape or form anti-gay.

Their catch-up conversation is littered with casual daggers to the heart, like her surprise that he\u2019s a father when she didn\u2019t think he was the type.  \u201cWe just never spoke about it,\u201d he says, correcting the assumption. \u201cIt\u2019s not a conversation we had.\u201d ", " In 2000, Ariel Sharon, then leader of the opposition, visited the sacred site surrounded by hundreds of police officers in riot gear. That visit was widely credited as a factor that set off the deadly second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, which lasted for several years.  The holiest site for Jews, and the third holiest for Muslims, the compound was conquered by Israel during the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. Under an uneasy arrangement that has prevailed for decades under Jordanian custodianship, Jews are permitted to visit, as are non-Muslim tourists, but they are not supposed to pray there. That norm, long enforced by the Israeli police in the interest of preserving public order, has been fraying in recent years.  The official rabbinical authorities say it is prohibited for Jews to enter the compound for fear that they may tread unwittingly on forbidden holy ground, and Mr. Netanyahu has repeatedly issued assurances that there has been no change in the status quo at the site.  But religious nationalists have increasingly made a point of visiting the mount and demanding equal prayer rights for Jews there. Mr. Ben-Gvir went regularly before becoming a minister, often at times of high tension.  The United States, Israel\u2019s most important ally, has warned against any change to the arrangements at the site. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said last month that the Biden administration would \u201cunequivocally oppose any acts that undermined the prospects of a two-state solution\u201d to the conflict.  \u201cDisruption to the historic status quo at holy sites\u201d would be such an act, he added.

Lock the video up forever, some Texas residents and former law enforcement officials say. Better yet, destroy it.  \u201cNo one ever needs to see that,\u201d said Charlene Uhl, whose 16-year-old daughter, Haley Krueger, was among the 26 victims of the assault.  But grisly videos and other images captured by live-streams, security cameras and cellphones are increasingly becoming part of a raw historical record of mass shootings, haunting pieces of evidence left behind along with bullet fragments and bloodstains. It takes just a quick web search to find hours of black-and-white security camera footage taken during the Columbine High School rampage in 1999.  Whether to ever release these videos or keep them permanently out of sight raises vexing questions. Releasing them could affect the integrity of law enforcement investigations, re-traumatize families of victims and feed online voyeurs and conspiracy theorists, officials say. But others argue that keeping the videos out of public view masks the true horror of mass shootings and allows politicians and the public to avoid confronting their bloody reality.  Officials have kept videos from other mass shootings out of public view for years after the fact, including those that captured parts of the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016, the attack at Fort Hood in 2009, and the deadly shooting at a constituent event in Tucson led by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords in 2011.

", " You don\u2019t see many happy faces standing in the seemingly endless line at immigration after an all-night flight. Sarah Miller, 62, Corvallis, Ore., recommends using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Mobile Passport Control app to shorten the wait.  \u201cI could bypass a long line in Portland when I was returning from a trip to England last June,\u201d she said. \u201cThe line for standard passport control was several hundred passengers, and no one was in the M.P.C. line. After I opened the app, I could snap a photo, answer a few questions (all done while I was walking over to the correct line), and I was done.\u201d  The Global Entry program offers some similar benefits but costs $100, requires an in-person interview and currently has an application backlog of up to 11 months; the Mobile Passport Control app is free and available to use at 33 U.S. international airports without any wait time. \u201cIt\u2019s a timesaving tool for those of us who don\u2019t travel abroad often,\u201d Ms. Miller said. 4. Bring your Global Entry card, even for domestic flights.  If you do sign up for Global Entry, the ID card that comes with it can help speed up border crossings from Canada and Mexico, but it can also be a lifesaver if you\u2019re traveling within the United States.  When Charlie Bishop, 73, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., found that his driver\u2019s license wouldn\u2019t scan at a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint for a domestic flight, his Global Entry card allowed him to proceed. ", " The Indian health minister, Harsh Vardhan, and his wife, Nutan Goel, received the Covaxin shots, developed by the Indian company Bharat Biotech, at a hospital in New Delhi on Tuesday.Credit...Altaf Qadri/Associated Press  India\u2019s ambitious but troubled campaign to inoculate its vast population against Covid-19 \u2014 and, in the process, to burnish its reputation as a manufacturer and innovator \u2014 received a major lift after initial trial results showed a homegrown vaccine was safe and effective.  Bharat Biotech, the Indian drug company that developed the shots, said late Wednesday that early findings from clinical trials involving nearly 26,000 subjects showed that the vaccine, Covaxin, had an initial efficacy rate of 81 percent.  The results have yet to be peer reviewed, the company said, and it was unclear how effective Covaxin would prove to be in a final analysis.  Still, the results were met with relief in India. Covaxin was approved by government officials in January and administered to millions of people even though it had not yet been publicly proved. Many in the country, including frontline health care workers, had feared that Covaxin could be ineffective or worse, slowing down the national campaign to inoculate 1.3 billion people.  Officials in Brazil, where the government had bought doses of Covaxin, had recently questioned whether the vaccine worked.  The results this week could alleviate some of those concerns, said Dr. Anant Bhan, a health researcher at Melaka Manipal Medical College in southern India. Still, he said, questions will linger over Covaxin until the research is completed. ", " BEN MILES  Huntington Beach, Calif.  To the Editor:  I awoke on Saturday in an alternate universe, where the front page of one of the most respected newspapers in the world reported on candidates for the most powerful position in the world \u2014 Donald Trump and Marco Rubio \u2014 trading insults about urine and sweat. Mr. Trump crudely mocks anyone who crosses him with ad hominem attacks on that person\u2019s intelligence or appearance.  It is conceivable that one of these men might one day have a finger on the nuclear button. What kind of future do we face when Americans allow, even celebrate, this appalling breakdown of civil discourse? I feel like a refugee in my own country.  FRAN GARDNER  Portland, Ore.  To the Editor:  Ross Douthat\u2019s claim that President Obama incited Donald Trump\u2019s rise (\u201cFrom Obama to Trump,\u201d column, Feb. 28) has a major flaw. Mr. Douthat states that the president abandoned white working-class voters, but he conveniently overlooks who really manned the barricades hobbling them.  From the day Mr. Obama won office, Republicans not only did nothing for working-class citizens while advancing the corplutocracy, they\u2019ve attacked every Obama initiative \u2014 starting in February 2009, when he signed a weak job-creating stimulus package that Republicans had fought to keep to a crippling fraction of what was needed, lest he be credited. They\u2019ve never let up since.  DALE MEAD  El Cerrito, Calif.

Tapped by Beyonc\u00e9 and Madonna, and releasing her own LP, her career is kicking into another gear. Honey Dijon holds her right hand above her head against a wood-grained wall, wearing an oversized blue button-down shirt with a red and blue graphic on it. Last week, Honey Dijon released \u201cBlack Girl Magic,\u201d her own collection of vocal-laden pure house songs.Credit...Myles Loftin for The New York Times  Honey Dijon is easy to talk to \u2014 if you can get in touch with her. Nearly 25 years into a career as a D.J. and electronic music producer, she is seemingly everywhere at once. During just one November week that included Manchester, England (where she played the 10,000-capacity venue Depot Mayfield); London; New York (where she was honored at the L.G.B.T.Q.-focused Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art); her hometown Chicago; and Berlin, where she lives \u2014 at least for the moment.  In a penthouse suite in a Lower East Side hotel, Dijon (legal name: Honey Redmond) took a rare moment to pause and reflect, while unsurprisingly multitasking, getting her hair and makeup done for a photo shoot in a white terry cloth robe. \u201cI\u2019d rather be exhausted from work than looking for it,\u201d she said, pausing perhaps for effect.  During her early days in nightlife, Dijon scraped by on $150 gigs. In 2022 alone, she estimates she\u2019s played 180 shows between club nights, festivals, fashion events and \u201cprivate corporate things\u201d \u2014 almost a full return to prepandemic levels, when she was spinning some 200 times a year.
