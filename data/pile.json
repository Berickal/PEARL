["Bromfenac ophthalmic solution 0.09 %: human aqueous humor concentration detected by high-performance liquid chromatography.\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the aqueous humor concentrations of bromfenac ophthalmic solution 0.09 % in patients undergoing phacoemulsification. Patients requiring cataract extraction received one drop (50 \u00b5L) of bromfenac 0.09 % solution in the eye to be operated, before bedtime the day before surgery or the morning of the surgery. The last administration was recorded. At the time of paracentesis, an aqueous humor sample was collected with a 30-gauge needle attached to a TB syringe and was later analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography for drug concentration. 188 treated volunteers and 48 control, untreated, subjects were included in the study. The mean aqueous concentration of bromfenac in the treated group was 37.60 \u00b1 68.86 and 0 nM (nmol/L) in the control group (p < 0.0001). Correlation coefficient in bromfenac group between time elapsed from instillation and drug concentration was -0.16 (p not significant). Bromfenac showed properties of good penetration and stable concentration in aqueous humor up to about 12 h after instillation.", "Cardiac output and regional hemodynamics during recurrent seizures in rats.\nAltered cardiovascular function in status epilepticus may contribute to mortality and morbidity in patients. We investigated changes in cardiac output and regional hemodynamics during 2 h of recurrent PTZ-induced seizures in anesthetized, paralyzed rats using radioactive microspheres, thermodilution methods, and the pulsed Doppler technique. Cardiac output fell 30-60% during recurrent seizures in 17 of 27 animals. The fall in cardiac output was sudden in onset and occurred primarily in association with seizures accompanied by prolonged increases in MABP but no change in central venous pressure. Total peripheral resistance (TPR) rose during early seizures in association with vasoconstriction of renal and certain splanchnic vascular beds. Ictal increases in TPR became attenuated during late seizures, due to failure of renal and splanchnic beds to constrict. Therefore, derangements in both cardiac and vascular function occur during late seizures. These derangements may contribute to both cerebral hypoperfusion and sudden death in status epilepticus.", "Characterization of two monoclonal antibodies against feline immunodeficiency virus gag gene products and their application in an assay to evaluate neutralizing antibody activity.\nMonoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 3B7 and 1C11 were produced against the gag gene products of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). These MAbs reacted strongly with FIV p24 in Western blots (immunoblots) and recognized p50 with a lower intensity. They specifically bound antigens in the cytoplasm of FIV-infected cells as determined by indirect immunofluorescence and immunocytochemistry. Although neither MAb inhibited viral replication in vitro, they were useful in a simple assay for the detection and quantification of infectious virus and neutralizing antibody activity. The assay utilizes Crandell feline kidney cells and requires 4 days for completion. Neutralizing antibodies in cats were detected 3 to 4 weeks after experimental infection with FIV. Antibody titres progressively increased during the first year of infection reaching high titres which were maintained 2.5 years post-infection. The MAbs produced should be valuable reagents for the monitoring of viral replication in cells or tissues from FIV-infected cats and for other in vitro applications.", "Heart Rate Variability during Periods of Low Blood Pressure as a Predictor of Short-Term Outcome in Preterms.\nEfficient management of low blood pressure (BP) in preterm neonates remains challenging with a considerable variability in clinical practice. The ability to assess preterm wellbeing during episodes of low BP will help to decide when and whether hypotension treatment should be initiated. This work aims to investigate the relationship between heart rate variability (HRV), BP and the short-term neurological outcome in preterm infants less than 32 weeks gestational age (GA). The predictive power of common HRV features with respect to the outcome is assessed and shown to improve when HRV is observed during episodes of low mean arterial pressure (MAP) - with a single best feature leading to an AUC of 0.87. Combining multiple features with a boosted decision tree classifier achieves an AUC of 0.97. The work presents a promising step towards the use of multimodal data in building an objective decision support tool for clinical prediction of short-term outcome in preterms who suffer episodes of low BP.", "Transmeningeal delivery of GABA to control neocortical seizures in rats.\nTransmeningeal drug delivery, using an implanted hybrid neuroprosthesis, has been proposed as a novel therapy for intractable focal epilepsy. As part of a systematic effort to identify the optimal compounds and protocols for such a therapy, this study aimed to determine whether transmeningeal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) delivery can terminate and/or prevent neocortical seizures in rats. Rats were chronically implanted with an epidural cup and an adjacent EEG electrode in the right parietal cortex. While the rat was behaving freely, a seizure-inducing concentration of acetylcholine (Ach) was applied into the cup. In a seizure termination study, either artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) or GABA (0.25, 2.5, 25 or 50mM) was delivered into the exposed neocortical area during an ongoing seizure. In a seizure prevention study, either ACSF or 50mM GABA was delivered into the epidural cup before the application of Ach. Epidural delivery of 50mM GABA completely terminated ongoing Ach-induced EEG seizures and convulsions within 17-437s after its delivery. ACSF and lower concentrations of GABA did not produce this effect, but 25mM GABA reduced seizure severity. However, the used GABA concentration could not prevent the development, or affect the severity, of Ach-induced EEG seizures and convulsions. This study indicates that transmeningeal GABA delivery can be used for terminating neocortical seizures, but to achieve seizure prevention via this route either a more efficient GABA delivery method needs to be developed or other neurotransmitters/pharmaceuticals should be employed for this purpose.", "Portable television remote controls are typically powered by batteries with limited life spans. Some remote controls can receive information from external devices, such as televisions or set-top boxes. In order to save battery life, remote controls can poll for information from external devices at predefined times. For example, a remote control might only listen for information only immediately after the user has used the remote control to send a command. One problem with this solution is that external devices may desire to send information to the remote control even when the remote control is not being used by the user. Another solution is for the remote control to listen for information at predefined intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes, 20 minutes). If the predefined interval is too short, however, the remote control battery may drain too quickly. If the predefined interval is too long, the remote control may miss information transmitted by external devices or receive information that is too old if the external device buffers the information until the remote polls it.", "ATF6\u03b1 downregulation of PPAR\u03b1 promotes lipotoxicity-induced tubulointerstitial fibrosis.\nTubulointerstitial fibrosis is a strong predictor of progression in patients with chronic kidney disease, and is often accompanied by lipid accumulation in renal tubules. However, the molecular mechanisms modulating the relationship between lipotoxicity and tubulointerstitial fibrosis remain obscure. ATF6\u03b1, a transcription factor of the unfolded protein response, is reported to be an upstream regulator of fatty acid metabolism. Owing to their high energy demand, proximal tubular cells (PTCs) use fatty acids as their main energy source. We therefore hypothesized that ATF6\u03b1 regulates PTC fatty acid metabolism, contributing to lipotoxicity-induced tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Overexpression of activated ATF6\u03b1 transcriptionally downregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1), the master regulator of lipid metabolism, leading to reduced activity of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation and cytosolic accumulation of lipid droplets in a human PTC line (HK-2). ATF6\u03b1-induced lipid accumulation caused mitochondrial dysfunction, enhanced apoptosis, and increased expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), as well as reduced cell viability. Atf6\u03b1-/- mice had sustained expression of PPAR\u03b1 and less tubular lipid accumulation following unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (uIRI), resulting in the amelioration of apoptosis; reduced expression of CTGF, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, and collagen I; and less tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Administration of fenofibrate, a PPAR\u03b1 agonist, reduced lipid accumulation and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in the uIRI model. Taken together, these findings suggest that ATF6\u03b1 deranges fatty acid metabolism in PTCs, which leads to lipotoxicity-mediated apoptosis and CTGF upregulation, both of which promote tubulointerstitial fibrosis.", "Curdlan sulfate/O-linked quaternized chitosan nanoparticles acting as potential adjuvants promote multiple arms of immune responses.\nNasal immunization to prevent and treat diseases caused by infection through the respiratory tract cannot be actualized because of the lack of effective adjuvants. We have proven that compared with antigens loaded on CS or O-HTCC alone in nasal vaccination, antigens loaded on the nanoparticles of curdlan sulfate/O-(2-hydroxyl) propyl-3-trimethyl ammonium chitosan chloride (CS/O-HTCC) can induce stronger systemic and mucosal immune responses. In this study, we evaluated the immunostimulatory activity and mechanisms of CS/O-HTCC nanoparticles. The results showed that CS/O-HTCC nanoparticles can improve the activation of antigen-presenting cells, upregulate the production of inflammatory factors and cytokines, induce cross-presentation, and simultaneously activate type I interferon-related genes. CS/O-HTCC nanoparticles also activated the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways and significantly promoted IL-2 transcription to induce the proliferation of lymphocytes. The results revealed that CS/O-HTCC nanoparticles as a type of multifunctional adjuvant can improve multiple arms of immune responses.", "Overview of HIV infection.\nTo understand the current status of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), including epidemiology, treatment, and recent advances. Relevant articles and publications from the medical literature, including the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 'Report on the global HIV/AIDS epidemic,' and information from recently held conferences. Now in its second decade, HIV infection has become a global pandemic, affecting communities throughout the world. Ninety percent of people with HIV live in developing countries. In these countries, HIV/AIDS has taken a heavy toll on economic, social, and family structures. It is responsible for a large proportion of adult deaths causing millions of children to be orphaned. The situation is different in the industrialized world, including the United States. Here, reports indicate that death and incidence rates as well as the development of opportunistic infections have been drastically reduced. These reductions are in part due to improved prevention efforts but mainly due to recent advances in the management of HIV infection, including the availability of new therapies.", "[Diversity of virus-like particles from salt mines in Yunnan, China].\nFor exploring and characterizing the diversity of virus-like particles from salt mines in Yunnan, China. Virus-like particles were identified from enriched brine or saline soil samples by transmission electronic microscopy and double-layer plate, and their morphological properties were further characterized. Three types of virus-like particles, head-tailed virus, linear virus and spherical virus, were observed by using transmission electronic microscopy. Then, two Halomonas viruses and one Chromohalobacter virus were subsequently isolated from Qiaohou salt mine and Yipinglang salt mine. According to the sample sources, their morphological characteristics and the character of host strains, those viruses were named as Qiaohou Halomonas Siphoviridae Virus 1 ( QHHSV-1), Yipinglang Halomonas Siphoviridae Virus 1 (YPHSV-1) and Yipinglang Chromohalobacter Pleomorphic Virus 1 (YPCPV-1). QHHSV-1 was head-tailed virus with a diameter of 47 nm icosahedrons-like head, and an easily broken 75 nm length tail. YPHSV-1 was head-tailed virus with a diameter of 50 nm icosahedrons-like head, and a 140 nm length tail. YPCPV-1 was a pleomorphic, variable-sized (20 -50 nm) virus, which possessed protuberances on the virus particles.", "A bio-psycho-social approach for treating sub-acute low back pain.\nThis article examines the distinctive opportunities and challenges involved in treating sub-acute low back pain (LBP). Several risk factors have been identified. Thus, a multi-disciplinary design and a comprehensive bio-psycho-social approach seem to be the best modality of intervention to improve outcome. The relevant literature on various factors that are supposed to improve outcome is summarised and discussed. A controversial on the rehabilitation benefits still exists. From one side, meta-analytic studies provide a small evidence of effectiveness. Most treatments for chronic LBP provide weak results and the benefits can be just transient. From the other side, comprehensive bio-psycho-social approaches seem to be the best modality of intervention to facilitate physical outcome and return to work. This article reflects the conviction that clinicians with a special knowledge on LBP problems and researchers with a special knowledge on health policy will better work together. Their targets are outcome and cost-benefit ratio by taking into account the economical and political milieu of the country where the research is carried out.", "Determination of bone blood supply with Tc-99m red blood cells and In-113m transferrin in fractures of femoral neck: concise communication.\nThe uptake of in vivo labeled Tc-99m RBCs and In-113m transferrin was studied in femoral bone of 21 patients who had recent operations for fracture of the femoral neck. Femoral bone biopsies and blood samples were obtained during the operation. The activity values for bone biopsies, erythrocytes, and serum were determined, and the uptake ratios between bone and erythrocyte cpm/g and between bone and serum were calculated. Biopsy samples were taken from the femoral head in 21 cases and from the trochanteric region in 14. The activity ratios for the two tracers correlated well: r = 0.94 for femoral head biopsies (P less than 0.001) and r = 0.98 for samples from the trochanteric region (P less than 0.001). Thus, the procedures are interchangeable and either may be valuable in assessing bone blood supply. An additional patient, studied only with Tc-99m RBCs, had a subsequent operation for nonunion of a fracture. Samples of both cancellous and cortical bone were obtained from the removed head. The activity ratios for the two types of bone tissue differed significantly (P = 0.02).", "Our objective is to improve the overall outlook for patients with malignant diseases. Our objective includes not only efforts to prolong the survival of such patients, but also to improve the quality of their life. We recognize that relatively speaking, at any one institution, these disease are annually encountered in numbers too small to allow controlled clinical trials to expect successful conclusions within a reasonable time frame. This difficulty is surmounted by our participation as a member institution of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB). We have been a member institution of the CALGB for 21 years. We have established a functioning multidisciplinary team-effort for planning and actual dispensing of treatment of patients with cancer. Appropriate specialists from medical oncology, surgery, radiation therapy, pathology, psychiatry, social service and nursing departments are fully involved. Consistent with our approach to the patient as a whole rather than only to the cancer site, our studies lay particular stress on predictive testing both in vivo (staging) and in vitro, to determine the most effective therapy. By involving all medical and paraprofessional staff in such controlled clinical trials, we encourage the investigational and research traits in our faculty. In many respects, the development of our efforts has paralleled the development of CALGB. Senior members of staff from LIJ and affiliated institutions have provided leadership roles to the entire group in areas as diverse as study design and chairmanship of major leukemia protocols to Constitution Epsilon By-laws and Ethics and Peer Review committees. Our institution has a well established tradition of conviction and dedication to CALGB activities in efforts towards control of cancer.", "Coronary artery calcification and family history of premature coronary heart disease: sibling history is more strongly associated than parental history.\nThe objective of the study was to assess the association of a family history (FH) of premature coronary heart disease (CHD) with coronary artery calcification (CAC) in asymptomatic individuals and to compare the effects of sibling or parental FH on the risk of subclinical atherosclerosis. CAC by electron beam tomography was performed in 8549 asymptomatic individuals (69% men; mean age, 52+/-9 years). The prevalence and odds of any CAC and extent of CAC stratified according to FH of premature CHD were determined. Those with (1) no FH of CHD, (2) FH of premature CHD in parents, or (3) FH in siblings had a prevalence of CAC of 55%, 64%, and 78% (P<0.0001) among men and 27%, 36%, and 56% (P<0.0001) among women, respectively. The multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the presence of CAC was 1.3 (1.1 to 1.6) among those with positive FH of premature CHD in parents only, 2.3 (1.7 to 3.1) and 2.5 (1.8 to 3.3) among those in siblings and a combined FH compared with those without FH of CHD in men, respectively. Among women, the corresponding odds ratios were 1.3 (1.0 to 1.8), 2.3 (1.7 to 3.6), and 1.9 (1.3 to 3.1), respectively. A similar trend was observed in the association of FH of premature CHD with increasing CAC scores. Our study demonstrates a highly significant association between FH of premature CHD and the presence and extent of CAC. Furthermore, within the limits of self-reporting of family history, our findings suggest that a sibling history is more strongly associated with subclinical coronary atherosclerosis than a parental history of premature CHD.", "Physical association of CD5 and the T cell receptor/CD3 antigen complex on the surface of human T lymphocytes.\nThe physical association of CD5 and the T cell antigen receptor (TcR)/CD3 complex on the surface of intact human lymphocytes was investigated using co-capping experiments and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses. Antibody-induced capping of CD5 or CD3 and double indirect immunofluorescence labeling revealed a specific co-localization of a significant fraction of CD3 and CD5 molecules on the T cell surface. By means of FRET measurements we studied further the physical proximity of CD5 and the TcR/CD3 complex at the surface of normal lymphocytes. Significant fluorescence energy transfer was measured between CD5 and CD3 molecules indicating that the associated molecules were within 10 nm of one another. No energy transfer was observed between the integrin alpha 4 beta 7 and CD3 or CD5. The close physical proximity measured between CD5 and CD3 correlates with our co-capping data and taken together the results show that the association of CD5 and the TcR/CD3 complex first detected by immunoprecipitation occurs on the surface of human T cells under physiologically relevant conditions.", "Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: sinusal/sinusoidal localization of malignant cells expressing the T-cell receptor gamma delta.\nPeripheral T-cell lymphomas consist of a clinically heterogeneous group of malignant disorders whose immunophenotype usually corresponds to that of normal mature T cells. We describe and correlate the clinical, histopathologic, phenotypic, and genotypic findings in two patients with malignant lymphoma presenting with hepatosplenic disease. The morphologic pattern of lymphoma was that of a sinusal/sinusoidal infiltration in spleen, marrow, and liver. This morphologic characteristic was associated with the presence of a productive clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) delta gene. Lymphoma cells expressed a CD3-TCR-gamma delta- phenotype. They were also double negative (ie, CD4-CD8-) and lacked the CD5 and CD7 antigens. In one patient, tumor progression was associated with phenotypic changes that resulted in a CD3-TCR-gamma delta- phenotype with the same delta-gene rearrangement as initially. These observations suggest the existence of a new type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma characterized by its hepatosplenic presentation, and by the sinusal/sinusoidal tropism and the TCR-gamma delta phenotype of the malignant cells.", "Histologic Evaluation of Lymphaticovenular Anastomosis Outcomes in the Rat Experimental Model: Comparison of Cases with Patency and Obstruction.\nLymphaticovenular anastomosis plays an important role in the surgical treatment of lymphedema. The outcomes of lymphaticovenular anastomosis are evaluated based on changes in edema; however, isolated assessment of the anastomosis itself is difficult. The authors used an animal experimental model to conduct a detailed examination of histologic changes associated with lymphaticovenular anastomosis and determined the factors important for success. The experimental lymphaticovenular anastomosis model was created using lumbar lymph ducts and iliolumbar veins of Wistar rats. The authors performed anastomosis under a microscope and reviewed postoperative histologic changes using optical and electron microscopy. In addition, electron microscopy and histology were used for detailed examination of the area in the vicinity of the anastomotic region in cases with patency and obstruction. The patency rates immediately after, 1 week after, and 1 month after lymphaticovenular anastomosis were 100 percent (20 of 20), 70 percent (14 of 20), and 65 percent, respectively. A detailed examination of the anastomotic region with electron microscopy revealed that, in cases with patency, there was no notable transformation of the endothelial cells, which formed a smooth layer. In contrast, in obstruction cases, the corresponding region of the endothelium was irregular in structure. Vessel obstruction after lymphaticovenular anastomosis may be associated with irregular arrangement of the endothelial layer, leading to exposure of subendothelial tissues and platelet formation. One part of the postoperative changes after anastomosis and a cause of obstruction were elucidated in this study. The authors' results may enable improvements in lymphaticovenular anastomosis by translating back to real clinical operations.", "Dilatation or no dilatation of the cervix during cesarean section (Dondi Trial): a randomized controlled trial.\nTo assess the effects of mechanical dilatation of the cervix during cesarean section on postoperative morbidity. A total of 447 women with elective cesarean section were included in the Dondi trial (Dilatation or no dilatation of the cervix during cesarean section). The primary outcome measure of this randomized controlled trial was postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) within 6 weeks. Infectious morbidity (puerperal fever, endometritis, wound infection, and urinary tract infection), blood loss (need for blood transfusion or change in hemoglobin levels), and operating time were also evaluated. The rate of PPH within 6 weeks was not different between the two groups [dilatation group: 5 (2.4 %), no dilatation group: 3 (1.2 %), p = 0.479]. Infectious morbidity, blood loss, and operating time were not diverse as well. The only significant difference between the two groups was the rate of retained products of conception with fewer cases after cervical dilatation (0 versus 6.2 %, p < 0.001). Dilatation of the cervix during cesarean section compared with no dilatation of the cervix did not influence the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. However, there were fewer cases with retained products of conception after dilatation.", "A possible mode of cardiovascular actions of dopamine in dogs.\nA possible mode of cardiovascular actions of dopamine was studied using ephedrine. In the dog pretreated with repeated administrations of ephedrine (total dose, 40 or 80 mg/kg, i.v.) or with combined administrations of ephedrine (total dose, 90 mg/kg, s.c. and i.v.) and reserpine (2 mg/kg, s.c., 24 hr previously), pressor responses to dopamine were eliminated and reversed to depressor responses whereas depressor responses to dopamine were potentiated. Positive chronotropic effects of dopamine were almost eliminated. Pressor and positive chronotropic effects of tyramine were almost abolished. Sympathomimetic effect of noradrenaline and adrenaline were potentiated while those of isoprenaline were inhibited. In the heart-lung preparation of ephedrine-treated dogs (total dose, 40 mg/kg, i.v.), cardiac stimulating effects of dopamine and tyramine were strongly depressed, and those of noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoprenaline were reduced to some extent. In the open-chest dogs, after pretreatment of cocaine (4 mg/kg, i.v.), pressor, positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of noradrenaline were potentiated, whilst those of tyramine were inhibited. Those of dopamine were not visibly altered, but depressor, negative chronotropic and inotropic effects of dopamine appeared at small doses. In the ephedrine-pretreated dogs, these sympathomimetic effects of dopamine and tyramine after cocaine were strongly depressed and those of noradrenaline were inhibited to a certain degree. The results obtained with ephedrine suggest that dopamine differs from other catecholamines and tyramine in the mode of cardiovascular actions.", "Effect of myocardium at risk on outcome after coronary artery occlusion and release.\nThe relationship between the probability of sustaining ventricular fibrillation during occlusion or release of a canine coronary artery and the amount of myocardium made ischemic has never been carefully assessed. We occluded the left anterior descending coronary artery above or below the septal artery for 20 min and then released the ligation. The amount of left ventricle perfused by the ligated vessel was determined by injection of different color monastral dyes above and below the ligation. Despite careful ligature placement immediately proximal or distal to the septal artery, there was wide variation in the amount of left ventricle perfused by the ligated vessel, or myocardium \"at risk.\" Myocardium at risk ranged between 24 and 51 g for ligations placed above the septal artery and 14 and 27 g for ligations placed below the septal artery. Ventricular fibrillation during occlusion and after release correlated significantly with the amount of myocardium at risk. This relationship was well described using the logistic risk regression model. The model predicts uniformly low and uniformly high probability of ventricular fibrillation with small and large amounts of myocardium at risk, respectively, and a direct correlation for midrange values of myocardium at risk. This relationship can account for a substantial portion of non-drug related variability in outcome of antiarrhythmic trials using the canine coronary occlusion or release model.", "[The influence of lung volume and body position on pulmonary blood flow under hypoxic exposure].\nWe examined the changes in the electromagnetically measured left lower lobe blood flow (QLLL) when the left lower lobe (LLL) was exposed to alveolar hypoxia selectively under two different positions (supine and right lateral position in 18 dogs. QLLL/CO, Qs/Qt and other cardiopulmonary parameters were obtained during the following experimental sequence; 1) the whole lung ventilated with 100% O2 (control), 2) LLL collapsed and the remainder ventilated with 100% O2, 3) N2 expansion of LLL (N2 CPAP) and the remainder ventilated with 100% O2, 4) O2 expansion of LLL (O2 CPAP) and the remainder ventilated with 100% O2, and 5) The whole lung ventilated with 100% O2. In the supine position group (n = 9), both selective collapse and N2 CPAP of LLL caused QLLL/CO to decrease significantly (P less than 0.02) from control values (14.9 +/- 1.7%) to 10.6 +/- 0.9% and 11.9 +/- 1.6%, respectively. But there was no difference in QLLL/CO between collapse and N2 CPAP of LLL. In the right lateral position group (n = 9), hypoxic exposure of LLL caused no decrease in QLLL/CO from control values. But QLLL/CO during N2 CPAP (8.5 +/- 1.1%) decreased significantly than that during collapse (10.8 +/- 1.5%) (P less than 0.02). Qs/Qt during N2 CPAP (15.6 +/- 1.4%) also decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) from that during collapse (18.5 +/- 2.2%). We conclude that the difference of the changes in QLLL/CO under hypoxic exposure between supine and right lateral position was caused by hydrostatic pressure which influenced more during lateral position than during supine position.", "Variable Levels of Glutathione S-Transferases Are Responsible for the Differential Tolerance to Metolachlor between Maize (Zea mays) Shoots and Roots.\nGlutathione S-transferases (GSTs) play important roles in herbicide tolerance. However, studies on GST function in herbicide tolerance among plant tissues are still lacking. To explore the mechanism of metolachlor tolerance difference between maize shoots and roots, the effects of metolachlor on growth, GST activity, and the expression of the entire GST gene family were investigated. It was found that this differential tolerance to metolachlor was correlated with contrasting GST activity between the two tissues and can be eliminated by a GST inhibitor. An in vitro metolachlor-glutathione conjugation assay confirmed that the transformation of metolachlor is 2-fold faster in roots than in shoots. The expression analysis of the GST gene family revealed that most GST genes are expressed much higher in roots than shoots, both in control and in metolachlor-treated plants. Taken together, higher level expression of most GST genes, leading to higher GST activity and faster herbicide transformation, appears to be responsible for the higher tolerance to metolachlor of maize roots than shoots.", "The adhesion to the vessel wall and extravasation of circulating tumor cells (CTC) is a complex interplay between hydrodynamic shear forces and chemical receptor-ligand binding kinetics, and is critical to the hematologic spread of many metastatic cancers including those originating from prostate, breast, colon, and skin. Consistent with the overarching organizational framework of this proposed Center, Project 3 will deconvolve the complexity of metastatic cell adhesion in the bloodstream by utilizing experimental and theoretical approaches derived from the physical sciences. A major question that we will address is: Can CTC adhesion to the vessel wall and extravasation be understood as a multistep cascade, similar to leukocyte recruitment in inflammation? The proposed research is organized around three specific aims. Aim 1: Application of a multiscale model to predict rolling and firm adhesion of circulating tumor cells. The multiparticle adhesive dynamics simulation with stochastic selectin:carbohydrate and MUC1:ICAM-1 binding will be used with input parameters obtained from primary tumor cells isolated from the blood of metastatic cancer patients. Aim 2: Characterization of the adhesion of CTCs to defined molecular surfaces and endothelial cell monolayers under physiological shear stress. Cancer cells spiked into whole blood will be perfused through microfluidic flow chambers to test adhesion predictions of Aim 1 and identify differences between microvascular endothelial cells from different tissues. Aim 3: Study of CTC adhesion, mechanical plugging and extravasation in a live animal model. Fluorescently labeled cancer cells will be observed in the microvessels of mouse brain and skull using multiphoton intravital microscopy, to determine the relative importance of adhesion receptors and mechanical plugging in tumor cell recruitment from the bloodstream. Taken together, the proposed research will lead to new pathways to intervene in the development of cancer, such as the quantitative evaluation of biomolecular targets for. disrupting metastatic cell adhesion.", "Density functional theory studies of the palladium-silver(211) stepped surfaces.\nTwenty-five kinds of Palladium-silver alloy stepped surface models are established based on the pure Pd(211) stepped surface system. The surface energies, work function, d-band center and the d-band local density of states (d-LDOS) on these different Palladium-silver alloy stepped surface configurations were investigated using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of density functional theory (DFT). The calculation results show that both the concentration and position of the doped Ag atoms have effect on these four surface parameters. The surface stability is weakened with increase of the concentration of the doped Ag atoms. The work function is more sensitive to the position of Ag atoms than the Ag concentration, while the surface energy is more depended on the Ag concentration. The substitution of Pd atoms by Ag on the pure Pd(211) stepped surface leads to the reduction of the work function. On the other hand, the d-band center of the surface Pd atoms shifts to the Fermi energy level when the Ag atoms substitute the Pd atoms in the third layer. Furthermore, the magnitude of the surface Pd d-band center increases with the content of Ag atoms from the bottom to the top along the stepped surface, and the bonding activity of the surface Pd atoms enhances. The further d-LDOS analysis shows that the Pd d-electronic structure changed with the substitution by Ag atoms on the stepped surface.", "Validation of a Risk Index Model for Predicting Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus Transmission to Horses in Florida.\nEastern Equine Encephalitis Virus (EEEV) is the most pathogenic arbovirus endemic to the United States. EEEV primarily infects birds but can be fatal to humans, horses, and some other mammals. Although EEEV transmission occurs in the Northeastern, Southeastern, and Midwestern United States, the largest number of horse and human cases have been reported in Florida, the only state where transmission occurs year round. Currently, a GIS-based risk index (RI) model is used to map EEE transmission risk to horses in Florida. This study validates that RI model using a 5-yr dataset of horse cases in Florida. RI values were similar between summer (N = 152, x\u00af = 0.59) and winter (N = 25, x\u00af = 0.66) cases, suggesting the model is effective for mapping risk during both transmission seasons. These risk values were larger and remained similar when a 100-m buffer was applied to the case locations to account for modest spatial errors in case reporting (summer x\u00af = 0.73, winter x\u00af = 0.77). In both comparisons, RI values for summer and winter cases were higher than expected at random in the Panhandle, North, and Central regions of the state, although the analysis was inconclusive in the South, where only two cases were observed. This suggests the RI map could be used to target EEEV surveillance, prevention, and control efforts in both transmission seasons in Florida.", "Photosensitivity in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.\nPhotosensitivity is reported to occur in approximately 40% of patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Our experience suggests that the prevalence is higher and may be related to both the duration of intermittent photic stimulation and also the age at which the procedure is undertaken. A two-year retrospective review of all EEGs was undertaken on all children attending a paediatric EEG department to identify those with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Photosensitivity was defined as a generalized spike or spike-wave paroxysm occurring at least twice during intermittent photic stimulation. Sixty-one children with a diagnosis of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy with a median age of 13 (range 7-16) years were identified, 55 (90%) of whom were photosensitive. Eighteen of these 55 patients showed photosensitivity only after four minutes of continuous photic stimulation. The prevalence of photosensitivity in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is likely to be higher than previously reported. When a diagnosis of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is being considered, the initial diagnostic EEG should include intermittent photic stimulation for up to five minutes, or less if the patient shows evidence of photosensitivity. The identification of photosensitivity may have important management implications.", "The Meaning and Predictive Value of Self-rated Mental Health among Persons with a Mental Health Problem.\nSelf-rated health is a valid measure of health that predicts quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. Its predictive value reflects a conceptualization of health that goes beyond a traditional medical model. However, less is known about self-rated mental health (SRMH). Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey ( N = 2,547), we examine how rating your mental health as good-despite meeting criteria for a mental health problem-predicts outcomes. We found that 62% of people with a mental health problem rated their mental health positively. Persons who rated their mental health as good (compared to poor) had 30% lower odds of having a mental health problem at follow-up. Even without treatment, persons with a mental health problem did better if they perceived their mental health positively. SRMH might comprise information beyond the experience of symptoms. Understanding the unobserved information individuals incorporate into SRMH will help us improve screening and treatment interventions.", "[Comparison between the epileptic manifestation of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome with and without previous West syndrome].\nCclinical and electroencephalographic aspects of twenty seven (27) patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were studied (20 without previous West syndrome, group A, and 7 with this antecedent, group B). The epileptic seizures were characterized through descriptions made by relatives who were in close contact with the patients, and also by direct observation by the author in the clinic. The direct observation was possible due to high frequency rates of the seizures. Different clinical patterns were observed in patients who had and who had not previous history of West syndrome. The analysis of these differences permitted the identification of two groups of patients, although both of them had sharp and slow waves in the EEG. The clinical picture of each group was interpreted as the result of the stage of cerebral maturation at the time the diffuse epileptic encephalopathy occurred.", "Neoral in de novo liver transplantation: adequate immunosuppression without intravenous cyclosporine.\nAbsorption of cyclosporine from the traditional oral formulation Sandimmune (Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland) is particularly unpredictable in the early stages after liver transplantation. The absorption of cyclosporine is influenced by liver function, postoperative paralytic ileus, and graft dysfunction. Oral absorption of cyclosporine from Sandimmune is also bile dependent; cholestasis and external biliary drainage are associated with low cyclosporine absorption. Postoperative administration of intravenous Sandimmune is therefore often necessary to obtain adequate immunosuppression, despite the increased risk of renal and neurological toxicity. A microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine, Neoral (Novartis), has been developed to overcome the problems of poor and variable absorption of cyclosporine from Sandimmune. Uptake of cyclosporine from Neoral is rapid and less dependent on bile secretion so that higher peak concentrations are reached and absorption is less variable than with Sandimmune. A review of several open studies in which Neoral was administered to liver transplant patients immediately after transplantation is presented. The results suggest that the use of Neoral as a primary immunosuppressive therapy provides adequate cyclosporine trough levels, minimizing or obviating the need for intravenous cyclosporine administration. In addition, Neoral appears to reduce the risk of acute rejection episodes compared with immunosuppressive regimens involving intravenous cyclosporine.", "Folic acid absorption in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.\nTo determine the folic acid absorption characteristics of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a prospective, controlled, result-blind single-dose oral absorption study was conducted. A total of 25 subjects were fasted and given 5 mg oral folic acid; blood samples were taken at time zero and after 30, 60, 90 and 180 min. Absorption of folic acid appears to be significantly impaired in HIV disease, irrespective of the stage of the disease and notwithstanding gastro-intestinal complaints, pathogen-negative diarrhoea or drug treatment. We here present functional data, complementary to previously reported structural and biochemical findings, to support the hypothesis that the virus can cause an enteropathy in the absence of opportunist infection. Folinic acid is absorbed by the same gut mechanism as folic acid, so caution may be needed when employing oral folinic acid rescue procedures in these patients, even when resting serum and red cell folate levels appear to be normal.", "Ratiometric Phosphorescent Probe for Thallium in Serum, Water, and Soil Samples Based on Long-Lived, Spectrally Resolved, Mn-Doped ZnSe Quantum Dots and Carbon Dots.\nThallium (Tl) is an extremely toxic heavy metal and exists in very low concentrations in the environment, but its sensing is largely underexplored as compared to its neighboring elements in the periodic table (especially mercury and lead). In this work, we developed a ratiometric phosphorescent nanoprobe for thallium detection based on Mn-doped ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) and water-soluble carbon dots (C-dots). Upon excitation with 360 nm, Mn-doped ZnSe QDs and C-dots can emit long-lived and spectrally resolved phosphorescence at 580 and 440 nm, respectively. In the presence of thallium, the phosphorescence emission from Mn-doped ZnSe QDs could be selectively quenched, while that from C-dots retained unchanged. Therefore, a ratiometric phosphorescent probe was thus developed, which can eliminate the potential influence from both background fluorescence and other analyte-independent external environment factors. Several other heavy metal ions caused interferences to thallium detection but could be efficiently masked with EDTA. The proposed method offered a detection limit of 1 \u03bcg/L, which is among the most sensitive probes ever reported. Successful application of this method for thallium detection in biological serum as well as in environmental water and soil samples was demonstrated.", "[Clinical features and efficacy of microsurgery for treatment of cerebral cysticercosis of the fourth ventricle: a report of 24 patients].\nTo analyze the clinical characteristics of 24 patients with cysticercosis of the fourth ventricle, and to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of microsurgery. The clinical data of 24 patients with cysticercosis of the fourth ventricle referred the Department of Neurosurgery of the Affiliated Hospital of Qinghai University from January 2000 to December 2018 were collected, and the clinical features, imaging characteristics, surgical methods, therapeutic efficacy and postoperative complications were analyzed. The 24 patients included 15 men and 9 women, and had a mean age of 43.5 years (range, 16 to 68 years). Preoperative imaging examinations showed obvious dilatation of bilateral lateral ventricles, the third ventricle and middle cerebral aqueduct, and spherical or cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle. There were 18 cases positive for antibodies against cysticercus, and 3 of the 21 cases were egg positives. All 24 cases received microsurgery, including 8 cases via the median aperture approach, 7 cases via the median aperture-cerebellar vermis approach, and 9 cases via the transcerebellomedullary fissure approach. There were 17 cases with complete delivery of vesicles, 5 cases with vesicle rupture and 2 cases with extraction of cystic fluid followed by separation and removal of cystic wall. All cases had obvious retraction of the ventricular system and disappearance of intracranial hypertension following surgery. There were 19 cases (79.17%) with well recovery, and 5 cases (20.83%) with aggravation or development of cerebellar ataxia, which recovered following treatment for 1 to 2 weeks. The transcerebellomedullary fissure approach is a safe and lowly invasive approach for the treatment of cysticercosis of the fourth ventricle.", "Identification of an arteriovenous fistula during free tissue transfer despite negative preoperative angiography: a potentially correctable cause of venous thrombosis.\nAlthough refinements in microvascular technique have resulted in great success with free tissue transfer, long-term anastomotic patency, particularly venous, is less predictable in patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse or other causes of intimal damage and/or venous hypertension. We report an unusual case in which an arteriovenous fistula was identified intraoperatively as the cause of pulsatile venous backflow despite a normal preoperative angiogram. A flow disturbance at the site of venous anastomosis and subsequent development of a venous thrombosis prompted more proximal venous exposure and the identification of an arteriovenous fistula. Once ligated, pulsatile venous backflow resolved and successful revision of the venous anastomosis was performed. This case illustrates that an anomalous arteriovenous communication must be considered when high-pressure venous backflow is observed intraoperatively, despite no evidence of an arteriovenous fistula on preoperative angiography, because, if identified and ligated, an arteriovenous fistula may represent a treatable cause of venous thrombosis.", "Effects of growing conditions on purple corncob (Zea mays L.) anthocyanins.\nPurple corn ( Zea mays L.) has been used for centuries as a natural food colorant in South America and, more recently, in Asia and Europe. However, limited information is available on the factors affecting their anthocyanin concentration and profiles. In this study, 18 purple corn samples grown under different conditions in Peru were evaluated for quantitative and qualitative anthocyanin composition as well as total phenolics. High variability was observed on monomeric anthocyanin and phenolic contents with yields ranging from 290 to 1333 mg/100 g dry weight (DW) and from 950 to 3516 mg/100 g DW, respectively, while 30.5-47.1% of the total phenolics were anthocyanins. The major anthocyanins present were cyanidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-maloylglucoside, pelargonidin-3-maloylglucoside, and peonidin-3-maloylglucoside, and 35.6-54.0% of the anthocyanins were acylated. Potassium sources/concentrations on the soil and seedling density did not significantly affect anthocyanin composition. The growing location affected anthocyanin levels and the percentage of anthocyanins to total phenolics ( p < 0.01) and should be taken into account when choosing a material for color production.", "Unusual clinical presentations of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type-2.\nMutations of PRF1 gene have been identified in familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type-2 (FHL-2) patients, and it has been reported as the commonest gene defect causing FHL. Patients with severe perforin deficiency usually present within first 1 year of life and with severe clinical manifestations. We report 4 cases of severe perforin deficiency presenting with delayed onset and unusual clinical presentations viz., B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the Hodgkin lymphoma, tuberculosis, and the Still disease. Three of these 4 cases showed a common heterozygous missense mutation (p.Trp129Ser). Two of these patients expired because of uncontrolled hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, one patient had 3 relapses while on therapy and one patient was in remission on maintenance therapy. This study shows variety of clinical manifestations of perforin deficiency and although the onset of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is delayed in these patients, the outcome remains poor as in classical severe perforin deficiency patients.", "Biphasic photoreceptor degeneration induced by light in a T17M rhodopsin mouse model of cone bystander damage.\nTo evaluate light-induced retinal damage in transgenic T17M rhodopsin mice as a novel model for bystander cone damage during retinal degeneration. Mouse eyes were exposed to bright white light (15,000 lux, 2.5 minutes). After exposure, electroretinography was performed on mice dark adapted for 12 or more hours at 0 to 5 days to test photoreceptor response or for 0 to 12 hours to test response recovery. Retinal cryosections were examined by TUNEL staining and outer nuclear layer thickness measurements. Cone morphology was assessed by peanut agglutinin staining in retinal flatmounts and cryosections. T17M retinal function and morphology changed rapidly after exposure to light. Scotopic and photopic electroretinogram responses declined progressively from 0.5 to 3 days. Scotopic response recovery peaked at 50% to 60% of the unilluminated response in 3 hours, indicating an early, rapid decline in scotopic signaling. Photopic responses were near normal or supernormal from 0 to 6 hours. Cell death peaked at 1 day, and outer nuclear layer thickness declined from 1 to 5 days. Disorganized cones were observed at 6 hours, intact and damaged cones were observed at 12 hours and 1 day, but only cone remnants were observed at 3 and 5 days. Light exposure had little to no effect on ERG responses in nontransgenic littermates and other retinal degeneration models. The time course of light-induced T17M retinal damage is biphasic, with an initial decline in rod function within hours followed by bystander cone and rod deterioration within days. The rapid and synchronous induction of damage in this model is attractive for characterizing bystander effects in retinal degeneration.", "Management of large hemispheric strokes in the neurological intensive care unit.\nPatients with large hemispheric strokes frequently develop neurologic deterioration secondary to cerebral edema. Despite supportive care in the intensive care unit and traditional forms of therapy for cerebral edema, they have a high morbidity and mortality. New forms of therapy are being investigated to improve outcome in these patients. This article begins with a discussion of the clinical and radiologic features of large hemispheric strokes. The role of increased intracranial pressure in neurologic deterioration and the predictors of outcome in these patients are reviewed. The various therapeutic options for management of cerebral edema in these patients, including the role of osmotic therapy, hypothermia, and hemicraniectomy, are explored. Neurologic deterioration in patients with large hemispheric strokes necessitates admission to the intensive care unit for management of the airway, blood pressure, and cerebral edema. New promising therapies, such as hemicraniectomy and hypothermia, need to be further evaluated to define their role in the management of these patients.", "In vivo observations on arterial micrografts.\nFew investigations have been made to date on the in vivo behavior of blood vessel grafts. An experimental model is described which permits continuous monitoring of grafted arteries both by gross examination and by in vivo microscopy. Allografts and autografts of the central ear arteries of rabbits, 0.5 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length, were transplanted in rabbit ears and subsequently enclosed with transparent plastic discs on each surface of the ear in place of the reflected skin. Allograft segments showed decreased vasomotor activity by about 3 weeks after grafting, whereas the recipient arteries and autograft segments retained their activity. Reduced activity of allograft segments was confirmed by their poor responses to vasoactive drugs. Many allografts thrombosed due to immune reaction between 3 and 8 weeks after grafting. Allografts that survived this episode went on functioning as efficient conduits of blood for many months thereafter.", "The role of tumor necrosis factor alpha in the pathophysiology of human multiple myeloma: therapeutic applications.\nIn this study we demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) triggers only modest proliferation, as well as p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-kappaB activation, in MM.1S multiple myeloma (MM) cells. TNFalpha also activates NF-kappaB and markedly upregulates (fivefold) secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a myeloma growth and survival factor, in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). TNFalpha in both a dose and time dependent fashion induced expression of CD11a (LFA-1), CD54 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, ICAM-1), CD106 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, VCAM-1), CD49d (very late activating antigen-4, VLA-4), and/or MUC-1 on MM cell lines; as well as CD106 (VCAM-1) and CD54 (ICAM-1) expression on BMSCs. This resulted in increased (2-4-fold) per cent specific binding of MM cells to BMSCs, with related IL-6 secretion. Importantly, the proteasome inhibitor PS-341 abrogated TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, induction of ICAM-1 or VCAM-1, and increased adhesion of MM cells to BMSCs. Agents which act to inhibit TNFalpha may therefore abrogate the paracrine growth and survival advantage conferred by MM cell adhesion in the BM microenvironment.", "ABSTRACT Despite advances in therapies for breast cancer, this disease remains a significant cause of mortality in women. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have the worst prognosis and survival outcome relative to other breast cancer subtypes. Therefore, much interest surrounds the development of systemic novel targeted therapeutics; however, little is known about how these drugs affect the surrounding non-tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment. Understanding how systemically-delivered breast cancer-targeted therapies interact with non-tumor cells such as infiltrating macrophages is necessary for elucidating how cells become drug resistant and for developing more effective and durable therapies in cancer patients. The Janus Kinase (JAK)/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) signaling pathway is activated in TNBC and is an attractive therapeutic target. New therapies in clinical trials aim to inhibit JAK/STAT signaling components, such as STAT5, to turn off this ?switch? in tumors that signal for growth and proliferation1. We find this component of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is also robustly activated in macrophages in response to TNBC tumor cell-derived factors. We hypothesize that although inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway may act on the primary tumor directly, the inhibitor alters a delicate balance in the microenvironment that influences infiltrating macrophages from an anti-tumor immune response to a pro-inflammatory and thus, pro-tumorigenic response. Our goal is to define the functional contributions of STAT5 to macrophage polarization within the tumor microenvironment and to macrophage-mediated resistance of mammary tumors to JAK/STAT inhibition. To address these questions, this proposal will employ use of mouse mammary tumor models and clinically- relevant JAK/STAT inhibition strategies to delineate the signaling components responsible for creating this shift from tumor-hostile to tumor-friendly, as well as, provide rationale for potential therapeutic interventions to maintain an anti-tumor response against TNBC.", "Field testing of a European quality of life instrument for children and adolescents with chronic conditions: the 37-item DISABKIDS Chronic Generic Module.\nThe aim of this study was to shorten the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) DISABKIDS Chronic Generic Measure (DCGM) for children and adolescents and to test its reliability, construct, and external validity. 1153 children and adolescents (8-16 years) with chronic health conditions (asthma, arthritis, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, diabetes, atopic dermatitis, cystic fibrosis) and their family were recruited from different paediatric clinical settings in seven European countries. A two-time assessment comprised reports on sociodemographics, health status and HRQL of children/adolescents. The 37-item DCGM describes six dimensions (Independence, Physical Limitation, Emotion, Social Inclusion, Social Exclusion and Treatment) confirmed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis, multi-item scaling and item-goodness of fit to Rasch model. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.70-0.87) and test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.71-0.83) were satisfactory. Correlations between DCGM-37 and other HRQL instruments were the highest between dimensions evaluating similar concepts. Regarding discriminant validity of the DCGM-37, girls and older adolescents reported lower emotional we ll-being. Children belonging to families with low level of affluence and those with severe health conditions were found to have worse HRQL in all domains. Reliability, construct validity as well as convergent and discriminant validity of the DCGM-37 were shown.", "Do physical activity levels influence the cardiovascular-related physiological characteristics of postmenopausal women?\nThis study aimed to determine whether cardiovascular-related physiological differences existed among postmenopausal women in relation to their physical activity levels. Participants were postmenopausal women (n= 101) resident in North Queensland. A self-report questionnaire determined recent exercise history. Anthropometric and physiological measures were obtained. Participants also performed a six-minute graded exercise test to determine cardiorespiratory fitness. Compared with the women who exercised, those women who did not exercise had a lower level of cardiorespiratory fitness (P= 0.00) and higher resting diastolic blood pressure (P= 0.01), BMI (P= 0.00) and WHR (P= 0.02). Discriminant function analysis found that a combination of BMI and cardiorespiratory fitness discriminated between the two groups. Postmenopausal women who performed moderate-intensity physical activity had more favourable cardiovascular-related physiological characteristics. Health professionals should encourage more postmenopausal women to participate in moderate-intensity activity to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.", "Neuroprotection by monocarbonyl dimethoxycurcumin C: ameliorating the toxicity of mutant TDP-43 via HO-1.\nMutation of TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) was detected in familiar and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and pathological TDP-43 was identified in the frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The neuroprotective functions of curcumin derivatives were assessed in motor neurons transfected with mutant TDP-43. We found that curcumin derivatives reduced the levels of TDP-43 fragments. Furthermore, we evaluated these compounds on the cellular model that the cells were transfected with TDP-25. We found that the expression level and aggregate formation of TDP-25 were significantly reduced by monocarbonyl dimethoxycurcumin C (Compound C). To study on the neuroprotective functions of curcumin derivatives, the neuroblastoma-spinal cord-34 cells transfected with mutant TDP-43 were assessed by the level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde bisdimethyl acetal (MDA) that were involved in the oxidative stress. We found that Compound C ameliorated the damage of mutant TDP-43 by reducing the level of MDA and LDH. Furthermore, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was induced by Compound C significantly higher than other compounds. Znpp, which is known an inhibitor of HO-1, dramatically interfered with the function of Compound C. In addition, Compound C was tested in vivo, and HO-1 was significantly upregulated at the hippocampus. These findings suggest that Compound C, which degrades TDP-43 fragment and strengthens the antioxidant ability by HO-1, is a promising agent for TDP-43 proteinopathy.", "The effect of delivery method on breastfeeding initiation from the The Ontario Mother and Infant Study (TOMIS) III.\nTo report on the relationship between delivery method (cesarean vs. vaginal) and type (planned vs. unplanned) and breastfeeding initiation in hospital and continuation to 6 weeks postpartum as self-reported by study participants. Quantitative sequential mixed methods design. Women were recruited from 11 hospital sites in Ontario, Canada. Participants included 2,560 women age 16 years or older who delivered live, full-term, singleton infants. Data were collected from an in-hospital questionnaire, hospital records, and a 6-week postpartum interview. Ninety-two percent of women reported initiating breastfeeding, and 74% continued to 6 weeks. The method of delivery, when defined as cesarean versus vaginal, was not a determining factor in breastfeeding initiation in hospital or in the early postdischarge period. An unexpected delivery method (i.e., unplanned cesarean or instrument-assisted vaginal deliveries) was associated, at a statistically significant level, with an increased likelihood of initiating breastfeeding and continuation to 6 weeks postdischarge. Breastfeeding can be considered a coping strategy that serves to normalize an abnormal experience and allows the individual to once again assume control. These unexpected results warrant further investigation to understand why women make the decision to initiate breastfeeding, why they choose to continue breastfeeding, and how they can be supported to achieve exclusive breastfeeding as recommended for infants in the first 6 months.", "Effects of baicalin on airway remodeling in asthmatic mice.\nAirway remodeling is an important characteristic of asthma, linking inflammation with airway hyperresponsiveness. Baicalin, a major active component, was isolated from Radix Scutellariae. Many studies show that baicalin has anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and anti-allergic effects. Here we investigate the influence of baicalin on asthmatic airway remodeling and the mechanism underlining the anti-remodeling effect in vivo.Asthmatic airway remodeling mice model was established by ovalbumin exposure. Seventy female BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to seven experimental groups: blank, ovalbumin, hexadecadrol, control, and baicalin (25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg) groups. Pulmonary function was measured using a whole-body plethysmograph in conscious and unrestrained mice. The lung pathology was observed and measured. The production of cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum was measured using enzyme-labeled immunosorbent assay kits, and the expression levels of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 and vascular endothelial growth factor were detected by immunohistochemistry. The protein expression levels of transforming growth factor-\u03b21, vascular endothelial growth factor, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p21ras were measured using Western blot. The results show that ovalbumin exposure significantly increased the expression of interleukin-13 in BALF and serum, and transforming growth factor-\u03b21, vascular endothelial growth factor, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p21ras expressions in the lungs. Baicalin attenuated the effects of ovalbumin significantly.It can be concluded that baicalin has significant anti-remodeling effect on ovalbumin-induced asthmatic airway remodeling mice model by decreasing expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b21, interleukin-13, and vascular endothelial growth factor and inhibiting the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.", "Joint air pollution sampling program in twin cities on the U.S.-Mexico border.\nCiudad Ju\u00e1rez (Chihuahua) and El Paso (Texas), two cities on the U.S.-Mexico border, form a single environmental system in which the same natural resources, especially air and water, are shared. It also constitutes a single metropolitan area which is characterized by high rates of pipulation growth, economic development, and urban expansion, all these factors mitigating against air quality. Early in 1972 the health authorities in El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez initiated a joint air pollution sampling program with assistance from the Pan American Health Organization. The nearby city of Las Cruces (New Mexico) was later included in the program as well. Activities are carried out in accordance with a document entitled \"Bases of Cooperation.\" The guiding criteria of the program are: functional simplicity, operational economy, and complementarity with other sampling programs conducted by the participating services. An Air Pollution Control Subcommittee is responsible for execution coordination of the program. Three studies are currently underway to determine levels of dust pollution in the air. A fourth study is aimed at measuring sulfur dioxide levels through the use of sulfation plates. The results collected reveal concentrations of particulates in the ambient air levels higher than the U.S. Federal primary standards. The program should be expanded to include the study of other pollutants and a joint inventory of emissions. In this way criteria on air quality may be established and joint plans of action and strategies drawn up for the control of air pollution in this important area.", "Modulation of non-painful phantom sensation in subjects with spinal cord injury by means of rTMS.\nWe aimed in this study to investigate whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), given as theta burst stimulation (TBS), can interfere with non-painful phantom sensations in subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI). In double-blind, sham-controlled experiments in five subjects with cervical or thoracic traumatic SCI, we evaluated the effects of a single session of inhibitory (continuous) TBS, excitatory (intermittent) TBS, or placebo TBS, on simplex and complex non-painful phantom sensations. The interventions targeted the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1), the primary sensory cortex (S1) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Measurements were carried out at baseline (T0), 5 min (T1) and 30 min later (T2) after the intervention. Descriptive evaluation of results shows that non-painful phantom sensations were not affected by rTMS applied over M1. Continuous (inhibitory) TBS over S1 induced a short-lasting decrease of simple non-painful phantom sensations, while continuous TBS over PPC induced a short-lasting decrease of both simple and complex phantom sensations. Intermittent (excitatory) TBS over PPC induced a slight increase of non-painful phantom sensations. Tests for significance confirm these observations, but must be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size. In conclusion, non-painful phantom sensations may be associated to a hyperexcitability of PPC and to a lesser extent of S1, which can be normalized by inhibitory rTMS. Our preliminary findings provide further evidence that neuromodulatory techniques are able to reverse phantom sensations not only after limb amputation but also in other conditions characterized by deafferentation such as SCI.", "The Russian flu. Its history and implications for this year's influenza season.\nFrom November 1977 through mid-January 1978 the population younger than 25 years in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics experienced a widespread epidemic of mild influenza (Russian flu) caused by an H1N1 virus similar to the virus that circulated worldwide during the early 1950s. Outbreaks of Russian flu occurred in school populations and military recruits in the United States starting in mid-January. Many other countries reported outbreaks of H1N1 virus in the winter of 1978. Predictions of influenza activity are always hazardous, but most experts believe that the Russian flu may occur again in the fall and winter of 1978. Other type A and B strains may also circulate; therefore, a trivalent vaccine containing A/USSR, A/Texas, and B/Hong Kong virus strains will be available. It is recommended that the chronically ill and those 65 years and older be the target populations for annual vaccination.", "The impact of financial constraints and incentives on professional autonomy.\nGeneral practice has been the subject of extensive reforms over the 1990s in Australia as elsewhere. Reforms have attempted to improve quality and contain the overall cost of health care, and have often been seen as reducing the autonomy of medical professionals. This paper examines the impact of financial constraints and incentives introduced during the 1990s on Australian GPs' perceptions of autonomy. An existing seven component definition of autonomy and six themes that emerged from reviewing publications were used to construct focus group questions. A total of 25 GPs participated in four focus groups. Those who participated believe that their financial autonomy has been diminished by policy changes and consumer expectations. They also perceive that their ability to control clinical decisions, which they regard as the most important aspect of professional autonomy, has been reduced along with financial autonomy. Organized medicine in Australia sees financial accountability and clinical decision making as polar opposites, and has continued to argue that fee-for-service payment is the only appropriate method of remuneration, despite increasing evidence that this does not guarantee clinical autonomy. Major changes to the financing of general practice in Australia are required to address the concerns of GPs, governments and patients.", "Ultrastructure of spindles and tufts in human dental enamel.\nA transmission electron microscope (TEM) study was made of spindles and tufts as identified in the light microscope, from samples prepared by selected-area argon-ion-beam thinning. Spindles in human dental enamel were found to be continuous with dentinal tubules across the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ) and usually appeared at the DEJ as electron-lucent, empty channels nearly circular in cross-section. The spindles were found to cross prism boundaries, branched rarely, and some were occasionally found to be occluded or partially occluded with small needle-like crystals (approximately 5 nm width and approximately 70 nm length), granular material (approximately 1.5 nm diameter) and/or amorphous material. Near the DEJ, the majority of spindles had a diameter less than 2 microns, while in the prismatic enamel away from the DEJ, spindles with a diameter greater than 2 microns were generally found. Spindle varicosity was characterized by an enlargement of their diameter. Tufts started at the DEJ and were not associated with dentinal tubules. Two types of ultrastructure were observed in the TEM: (i) disrupted regions of enamel incorporating large voids (up to approximately 0.1 microns in diameter), or, more commonly, (ii) channels within the enamel occluded or partially occluded, with small needle-like crystals and granular and/or amorphous material similar to that found in the enamel spindles. It was concluded that spindles and tufts represent areas of hypomineralization with increased void volume and partial remineralization.", "Interaction of CETP inhibitory peptide and lipoprotein substrates in cholesteryl ester transfer assay: relationship between association properties and inhibitory activities.\nIn a previous study, CETP inhibitory peptide (3 kDa) was isolated from hog plasma. The peptide, synthesized chemically according to the amino acid sequence of the 3-kDa peptide (designated P28), showed CETP inhibitory activity both in vitro and in vivo ICho et al. (1998) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1391, 133-144]. We report herein further unique features of P28 when it was associated with the cholesteryl ester (CE)-donor and -acceptor lipoproteins. Lipoprotein substrates with P28 present in both HDL (as a CE-donor) and LDL (as a CE-acceptor) served as poor substrates, with CE-transfer activity decreased up to 60% compared to normal substrates without P28. P28 was found to be located in HDL fractions of hog plasma and showed the same electromobility as that visualized by PAGE on 7% polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions. Addition of apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1) or apoB antibody to a normal CE-transfer mixture did not alter CE-transfer activity. However, addition of apoA-1 or -B antibody to a CETP-inhibition mixture decreased the inhibitory activity of P28 by ca. 20%. Western blot analysis revealed that P28 was associated only with human and hog HDL among several lipoproteins purified from human, hog, and rabbit. CETP-inhibition assays with various lipoprotein substrates revealed that P28 exhibited substrate-specific inhibitory activity. The inhibitory activity of P28 was highly dependent on the type of lipoprotein substrate (whether CE-donor or -acceptor); P28 inhibited CE transfer from HDL to LDL, but it did not inhibit CE transfer from HDL to HDL.", "Sulforaphane potentiates the efficacy of imatinib against chronic leukemia cancer stem cells through enhanced abrogation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin function.\nSulforaphane (SFN) has been indicated for the prevention and suppression of tumorigenesis in solid tumors. Herein, we evaluated SFN's effects on imatinib (IM)-resistant leukemia stem cells (LSCs). CD34(+)/CD38(-) and CD34(+)/CD38(+) LSCs were isolated from KU812 cell line flowcytometrically. Isolated LSCs showed high expression of Oct4, CD133, \u03b2-catenin, and Sox2 and IM resistance. Differentially, CD34(+)/CD38(-) LSCs demonstrated higher BCR-ABL and \u03b2-catenin expression and imatinib (IM) resistance than CD34(+)/CD38(+) counterparts. IM and SFN combined treatment sensitized CD34(+)/CD38(-) LSCs and induced apoptosis, shown by increased caspase 3, PARP, and Bax while decreased Bcl-2 expression. Additionally, the combined treatment reduced BCR-ABL and \u03b2-catenin and MDR-1 protein expression. Mechanistically, IM and SFN combined treatment resensitized LSCs by inducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, \u03b2-catenin-silenced LSCs exhibited reduced glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1) expression and intracellular GSH level, which led to increased sensitivity toward IM and SFN. We demonstrated that IM and SFN combined treatment effectively eliminated CD34(+)/CD38(-) LSCs. Since SFN has been shown well tolerated in both animals and human, this regimen could be considered for clinical trials.", "Universal pulses: A new concept for calibration-free parallel transmission.\nA calibration-free parallel transmission method is investigated to mitigate the radiofrequency (RF) field inhomogeneity problem in brain imaging at 7 Tesla (T). Six volunteers were scanned to build a representative database of RF and static field maps at 7T. Small-tip-angle and inversion pulses were designed with joint kT -points trajectory optimization to work robustly on all six subjects. The returned \"universal\" pulses were then inserted in an MPRAGE sequence implemented on six additional volunteers without further field measurements and pulse optimizations. Similar acquisitions were performed in the circularly polarized mode and with subject-based optimizations for comparison. Performance of the different approaches was evaluated by means of image analysis and computation of the flip angle normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE). For both the excitation and inversion, the universal pulses (NRMSE\u223c11%) outperformed the circularly polarized (NRMSE\u223c28%) and RF shim modes (NRMSE\u223c20%) across all volunteers and returned slightly worse results than for subject-based optimized pulses (NRMSE\u223c7%). RF pulses can be designed to robustly mitigate the RF field inhomogeneity problem over a population class. This appears as a first step toward another plug and play parallel transmission solution where the pulse design can be done offline and without measuring subject-specific field maps.

The on- and off-axis pulse intensities are calculated for collimated beam waves transmitted in the two typical directions of the slab. To a good approximation, the effect of finite beamwidth on the pulse intensity appears only through the diffusion factor in the radial direction of the beam, resulting in a faster decrease of the intensity in the tail part compared with that of the corresponding plane wave pulse. Also, the pulse shape does not appreciably change when the beamwidth is changed within the range of practical use. An analytical expression is obtained for the pulse width broadening and is applied to several typical cases leading to some simple expressions. The influence of the scatterers existing behind the source is discussed in some detail particularly in connection with pulse shape and width broadening, showing that, in many situations, the pulse width is determined mostly by the total optical thickness of the slab independently of the relative position of the wave source within the slab.", "Evidence for both oxygen and non-oxygen dependent mechanisms of antibody sensitized target cell lysis by human monocytes.\nRecent studies suggest that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or superoxide (O2-) may play a role in monocyte antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC). We studied ADCC by normal human monocytes, and monocytes from chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients, cells unable to generate ROS, toward anti-D sensitized human red cells (RBC) and an antibody sensitized lymphoblastoid cell line (CEM) by 51Cr release. The effects of hypoxia, scavengers of ROS, and the activity of the hexose monophosphate shunt pathway (HMPS) were examined. We found that monocyte HMPS activity increased two to threefold during ADCC toward RBC but was unchanged during ADCC toward CEM cells. Hypoxia decreased lysis of RBC targets by 80% but did not affect lysis of CEM cells even though hypoxia markedly decreased monocyte HMPS activity. Monocytes from CGD patients had impaired lysis of RBC but lysed CEM cells normally. We could not, however, demonstrate protection by scavengers of ROS. We conclude that monocyte ADCC involves two independent mechanisms: a nonoxidative mechanism active in the lysis of CEM cells, and an oxidative mechanism that may involve an unidentified ROS activated during ADCC toward RBC. The activation and possible interaction of these two mechanisms is determined by the nature of the target cell and sensitizing antibody.", "State-specific changes in cholesterol screening--behavioral risk factor surveillance system, 1988-1991.\nHigh blood cholesterol (HBC) is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease (1)--the leading cause of death in the United States. To reduce the prevalence of elevated cholesterol levels in the United States, in 1985 the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute initiated the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). The NCEP recommends that all adults aged > or = 20 years be screened for HBC at least once every 5 years. One of the national health objectives for the year 2000 is to increase to 75% the percentage of adults screened for HBC within the preceding 5 years (objective 15.14). To measure progress toward this objective, data from CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) were used to examine state-specific trends in cholesterol screening from 1988 through 1991. This report summarizes the results of this analysis and provides a projected estimate of the 1994 screening rates for HBC in each state.", "Effects of nitroglycerin and indomethacin on fetal-maternal circulation and on fetal cerebral blood flow and metabolism in sheep.\nOur purpose was to evaluate the effects of maternal administration of nitroglycerin and indomethacin on maternal and fetal hemodynamics and on fetal cerebral blood flow and metabolism in sheep. Invasive vascular and fetal carotid flow monitoring was established in 12 gravid ewes. Isotonic sodium chloride solution, nitroglycerin, and indomethacin were infused maternally, and maternal and fetal heart rate, blood pressure, blood gas values, fetal carotid blood flow, and flow variability were measured. Fetal cerebral uptake of oxygen, glucose, and lactate were calculated. Nitroglycerin infusion caused a significant increase in maternal and fetal heart rate and a significant decrease in maternal and fetal mean arterial pressure at a dosage of 10 microram/kg per minute, without a change in blood gas values. Neither drug had any effect on fetal carotid blood flow, flow variability, or cerebral substrate metabolism. Maternal administration of nitroglycerin and indomethacin caused no adverse maternal or fetal circulatory changes and did not alter fetal carotid blood flow or substrate metabolism.", "Evaluation of a Newly Available ELISA for Envoplakin Autoantibodies for the Diagnosis of Paraneoplastic Pemphigus.\nParaneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is routinely diagnosed by the presence of autoantibodies for desmoplakin by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on rat bladder epithelium (RBE). IIF on RBE has recently been found to be positive in select cases of other blistering disorders. A new ELISA that detects envoplakin autoantibodies has recently been developed for the diagnosis of PNP. In this study, we measure the specificity of IIF on RBE and compare it to the new ELISA. We measured the specificity of IIF on RBE to be 86% which is on the lower end of the previously reported specificity of 83% to 98.9%. The ELISA for envoplakin autoantibodies has a technical sensitivity of 100%, diagnostic sensitivity of 83%, and specificity of 91%. This ELISA for envoplakin autoantibodies is now commercially available and technically easier to perform then the immunoblot. We recommend that this new ELISA serves as a confirmatory test in cases of a positive IIF on RBE given its higher specificity.", "Development of Chemical and Metabolite Sensors for Rhodococcus opacus PD630.\nRhodococcus opacus PD630 is a nonmodel, Gram-positive bacterium that possesses desirable traits for biomass conversion, including consumption capabilities for lignocellulose-based sugars and toxic lignin-derived aromatic compounds, significant triacylglycerol accumulation, relatively rapid growth rate, and genetic tractability. However, few genetic elements have been directly characterized in R. opacus, limiting its application for lignocellulose bioconversion. Here, we report the characterization and development of genetic tools for tunable gene expression in R. opacus, including: (1) six fluorescent reporters for quantifying promoter output, (2) three chemically inducible promoters for variable gene expression, and (3) two classes of metabolite sensors derived from native R. opacus promoters that detect nitrogen levels or aromatic compounds. Using these tools, we also provide insights into native aromatic consumption pathways in R. opacus. Overall, this work expands the ability to control and characterize gene expression in R. opacus for future lignocellulose-based fuel and chemical production.", "[PTCA in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery and its potential availability: when can PTCA be an alternative to coronary artery bypass grafting?].\nThe potential availability of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was retrospectively evaluated for the responsible lesions among grafted vessels of 149 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The lesions suitable for PTCA were defined as discrete, segmental, subtotal and noncalcific, in proximal or middle portions of the major coronary arteries. Patients with left main trunk lesions, those with obstruction of two major coronary arteries, and those with lesions in donor arteries of jeopardized collaterals were excluded. Ninety-seven (31%) of a total of 308 grafted lesions were appropriate for PTCA. These included 38% of left anterior descending artery (LAD) lesions, 39% of left circumflex artery (CX) lesions, and 14% of right coronary artery (RCA) lesions. At least one lesion of 77 (52%) of 149 patients was suitable for PTCA. These included 66% of single vessel graft candidates, 54% of double vessel graft candidates, and 38% of triple or more vessel graft candidates. Ideal candidates for PTCA were 34 patients (23%) in whom all lesions in the grafted vessels were thought to be appropriate for PTCA, and these included 25 (LAD: 23, CX: 1, RCA: 1) of 38 single vessel graft candidates and nine (LAD + RCA: 6, LAD + CX: 2, CX + RCA: 1) of 111 multivessel graft candidates. There was no significant difference between the clinical characteristics of the patients ideally suited for PTCA and the remaining patients. Additional 25 candidates for multivessel grafting, whose lesions were appropriate for PTCA except that of the LAD, were considered limited candidates for PTCA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "Isolation, stability and bioactivity of Jatropha curcas phorbol esters.\nJatropha curcas seed oil, which can be utilized for biodiesel production upon transesterification, is also rich in phorbol esters (PEs). In this study, PEs from J. curcas oil (Jatropha factors C\u2081 and C\u2082 (purified to homogeneity), Jatropha factors C\u2083 and (C\u2084+C\u2085) (obtained as mixtures) and PE-rich extract (containing all the above stated Jatropha factors) were investigated. The concentrations of Jatropha PEs were expressed equivalent to Jatropha factor C\u2081. In the snail (Physa fontinalis) bioassay, the order of potency (EC\u2085\u2080, \u03bcg/L) was: PE-rich extract<factor C\u2083 mixture<factor C\u2082<factor C\u2081<factor (C\u2084+C\u2085). In the Artemia salina bioassay, the order of potency (EC\u2085\u2080, mg/L) was: factor C\u2082<factor C\u2083 mixture<factor C\u2081<factor (C\u2084+C\u2085) mixture. In addition, Jatropha PEs exhibited platelet aggregation (ED\u2085\u2080, \u03bcM, factor C\u2082<factor C\u2083 mixture<factor C\u2081<factor (C\u2084+C\u2085) mixture. The stability of a PE-rich extract was evaluated and found to be low at room temperature but favourable in ethanol over a range of temperatures. By integrating the isolation methodology developed in this study in the Jatropha biodiesel industry, PEs could be obtained as value-added co-products.", "Sustained health home visiting can improve families' social support and community connectedness.\nHome visiting (HV) is a strategy used internationally to address the multiple needs of infants and families at risk of suboptimal health and developmental outcomes. Describe nursing interventions and program achievements of a pilot HV program for families living in a highly disadvantaged outer suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. A family partnership model was adopted. Follow-up is reported for 65 of the 75 clients remaining in the program for at least 6 months. Nurses most commonly provided clients with emotional support, information about health and well-being and information on infant development. Clients experienced noteworthy improvements consistent with key objectives - greater access to support services, and increased self-efficacy and social networks. Consistent with the growing body of international literature on the achievements of HV, HV programs can empower vulnerable families to better cope with daily life demands and their family.", "Service providers and device manufacturers (e.g., wireless, cellular, etc.) are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by, for example, providing compelling network services. One area of interest has been the development of systems that improve and/or optimize connectivity among users (e.g., radio systems such as cognitive radio systems). Cognitive radio systems have the ability to obtain knowledge from, and become aware of both their internal and external environment (e.g., the radio environment, the service environment, and user preferences/behavior). In addition, cognitive radio systems can dynamically and autonomously adjust their behavior and operating parameters to best serve the specific needs of a user within the environment. The Internet is full of users belonging to different social groups and systems to form those groups (e.g., social networking systems). However, current cognitive systems lack the ability to make offers of resources (e.g., usable frequencies) and/or connectivity (e.g., channel reservation) based on these social groups. Accordingly, service providers and device manufacturers face significant technical challenges in providing a service that offers radio resources (e.g., spectrum, channels, bandwidth, etc.) and/or connectivity based on social groups.", "Impacts of bioinformatics to medicinal chemistry.\nFacing the explosive growth of biological sequence data, such as those of protein/peptide and DNA/RNA, generated in the post-genomic age, many bioinformatical and mathematical approaches as well as physicochemical concepts have been introduced to timely derive useful informations from these biological sequences, in order to stimulate the development of medical science and drug design. Meanwhile, because of the rapid penetrations from these disciplines, medicinal chemistry is currently undergoing an unprecedented revolution. In this minireview, we are to summarize the progresses by focusing on the following six aspects. (1) Use the pseudo amino acid composition or PseAAC to predict various attributes of protein/peptide sequences that are useful for drug development. (2) Use pseudo oligonucleotide composition or PseKNC to do the same for DNA/RNA sequences. (3) Introduce the multi-label approach to study those systems where the constituent elements bear multiple characters and functions. (4) Utilize the graphical rules and \"wenxiang\" diagrams to analyze complicated biomedical systems. (5) Recent development in identifying the interactions of drugs with its various types of target proteins in cellular networking. (6) Distorted key theory and its application in developing peptide drugs.", "The relationship between dental caries status and oral health attitudes and behavior in young Israeli adults.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiologic relationship between oral health attitudes and behavior as measured by the Hiroshima University-Dental Behavioral Inventory (HU-DBI) and dental caries status using the DMF in a sample of young Israeli adults. The HU-DBI (in Hebrew) was used to survey 123 young Israeli army recruits (eighteen and nineteen years old). All participants submitted to a clinical and radiographic dental examination. Dental caries status was evaluated using the World Health Organization (WHO) caries diagnostic criteria for decayed, missing, and filled teeth and surfaces (DMFT and DMFS, respectively). Data were statistically analyzed. DMFT and DMFS scores, which measure dental disease, ranged from 0 to 24 (average 6.77) and from 0 to 48 (average 10.95), respectively. There were sixteen (13 percent) caries free (DMF=0) participants. When relating the different DMF values to the HU-DBI responses, a statistically significant relation was found between seven items and DMF scores or their components and indices. The HU-DBI score ranged from 2 to 9 (mean 5.8, SD=1.5). Low DS and DT values significantly correlated with a high total HU-DBI score (p<0.05); that is, subjects with low levels of dental disease had more positive oral health attitudes and behavior. In young Israeli adults, dental disease, as measured by DMF scores or their components, were related to HU-DBI, which demonstrate the relationship of dental caries status with oral health behavior. Special emphasis should be given to improving patients' oral health attitudes and behaviors by providing patient education during treatment.", "JNK2-dependent regulation of SIRT1 protein stability.\nMammalian SIRT1 is an NAD-dependent deacetylase with critical roles in the maintenance of homeostasis and cell survival. Elevated levels of SIRT1 protein are evident in cancer in which SIRT1 can function as a cancer-specific survival factor. Here we demonstrate that elevated SIRT1 protein in human cells is not attributable to increased SIRT1 mRNA levels but, instead, reflects SIRT1 protein stability. RNAi-mediated depletion of JNK2 reduced the half-life of SIRT1 protein from >9 h to <2 h and this correlated with lack of SIRT1 protein phosphorylation at serine 27. In contrast, depletion of JNK1 had no effect upon SIRT1 protein stability and SIRT1 phosphorylation at serine 47 showed no correlation with SIRT1 protein stability. Thus we show that JNK2 is linked, directly or indirectly, with SIRT1 protein stability and that this function is coupled with SIRT1 phosphorylation at serine 27. Our observations identify a route for therapeutic modulation of SIRT1 protein levels in SIRT1-linked diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration and diabetes.", "Protective factors in male adolescents with a history of sexual and/or violent offending: a comparison between three subgroups.\nThis study aimed to examine the presence and impact of dynamic protective factors for delinquency in male adolescents with a history of sexual and/or violent offending. Bipolar factors (factors with risk and protective factors being the ends of the same continuum) were examined in male adolescents with a history of sexual offenses against younger children (CSOs; n = 341), a history of sexual offenses against peers and/or adult victims (PSOs; n = 207), and a history of nonsexual violent offenses (VOs; n = 1,356). We conducted secondary analyses on data collected with the Washington State Juvenile Court Assessment and on general recidivism data. ANOVA, correlations, Fisher's z tests, and logistic regression analyses were applied. Results showed that, in VOs, the number of risk factors was greater than the number of protective factors, whereas in PSOs, and especially CSOs, the number of protective factors was greater than the number of risk factors. Protective factors appeared to be especially important for juveniles with a history of sexual offenses for two reasons. First, the impact of most protective factors on recidivism was larger among juveniles with a history of sexual offenses than among those with a history of violent offenses. Second, protective factors added to the predictive accuracy over and above risk factors in juveniles with a history of sexual offenses, but not in those with a history of violent offenses.", "Interstitial cell infiltrate and myocardial fibrosis in dilated cardiomyopathy: a special type of cardiomegaly corresponding to sequelae of myocarditis.\nWe examined the relationship between interstitial cell infiltration and myocardial fibrosis in patients with clinically diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Forty-two cases of DCM were divided into two groups, according to the mean number of the interstitial round cells per 10.2 x 10(4) square microns (Nic): the inflammatory group (Nic greater than or equal to 5) and noninflammatory group (Nic less than 5). The 12 cases in the inflammatory group were clinically similar to the 30 cases in the non-inflammatory group, but the inflammatory group exhibited a significantly (P less than 0.001) larger area of myocardial fibrosis (34.8% +/- 12.8% vs 17.5% +/- 8.2%), a significantly (P less than 0.01) higher frequency of diffuse perimyocytic-type fibrosis (83% vs 23%), fewer myocardial cells in the left ventricular wall (170 +/- 70 fibers vs 216 +/- 81 fibers), and significantly (P less than 0.01) greater hypertrophy of the myocytes (18.3 +/- 3.4 vs 15.3 +/- 2.7 microns). In addition, cases exhibiting marked fibrosis (fibrosis area greater than or equal to 25% of the myocardium) had a significantly higher Nic score (8.3 +/- 6.8) compared to cases with the less fibrotic type of DCM (4.0 +/- 5.7). We speculate that persistent or preceding inflammatory cell infiltration induces the myocardial fibrosis, especially the diffuse perimyocytic type, in the fibrosis-predominant type of DCM. Therefore, most of these cases may be a sequela of myocarditis, and more correctly termed post-myocarditic cardiomegaly.", "Construction, expression, and characterization of an anti-tumor immunotoxin containing the human anti-c-Met single-chain antibody and PE38KDEL.\nRecombinant immunotoxins consisting of small antibody fragments fused to cytotoxic moieties are being evaluated for use in prospective antibody-targeted cancer therapies. A receptor tyrosine kinase known as c-Met is overexpressed in a vast range of human malignancies, making it an ideal target for antibody-mediated delivery of numerous cytotoxic agents. A single Fab molecule capable of binding to human c-Met with high affinity and specificity was previously identified using antibody phage-display technology. In order to develop a molecule to increase both the cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity of the anti-c-Met molecule, a recombinant immunotoxin anti-c-Met/PE38KDEL was constructed and expressed by fusing the human anti-c-Met single-chain variable fragment (ScFv) with a modified Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE38KDEL). Purified anti-c-Met/PE38KDEL was demonstrated to specifically bind to cells of c-Met-positive human hepatoma cell lines, causing a proliferation defect by inducing caspase-3/8-mediated apoptosis, as observed by in vitro assays. Furthermore, anti-c-Met/PE38KDEL administration was shown to inhibit the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts in vivo through suppression of Ki-67 expression and enhancement of tumor cell apoptosis rates. Cumulatively, the current findings demonstrate the successful construction of a recombinant immunotoxin capable of accurately targeting c-Met-positive human hepatoma cell lines both in vitro and in vivo, providing a novel compound with potential for applications as an alternative therapy for c-Met-positive cancer management.", "Primary spontaneous pneumothorax treated by video assisted thoracoscopic surgery--results of intermediate follow up.\nPrimary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is a common clinical condition associated with high recurrence if no definitive treatment is given and could be life threatening if left untreated. The best treatment for this condition, however, remains controversial. A prospective study of patients with PSP treated by video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) after a mean follow up of 16 months. Between September 1992 and April 1994, 114 VATS procedures were performed on 110 patients with PSP (including four patients with bilateral presentation) by one surgical team from a single institution. Mechanical pleurodesis with Marlex mesh was performed on all patients. In addition, apical bullae were identified in 100 cases (88%) and these were resected. There was no mortality. The median hospital stay was three days. The procedure was well accepted by patients and this was reflected subjectively in a visual analogue scale and objectively in the requirement of postoperative analgesia. Complications included one wound infection, one bleeding, eight persistent air leaks over ten days. We had two failures with recurrence of pneumothorax occurring one week and two months postoperatively (mean follow up of 16 months). Late morbidity with intercostal neuropathy was identified in nine patients but only two of them required oral analgesics. VATS is a quick and effective treatment for PSP. We currently recommend VATS for patients with recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, as well as first time pneumothoraces associated with tension, bilaterality, frequent travelling, unreliable follow up and persistent air leak over three days.", "Identification and expression analysis of CjLTI, a novel low temperature responsive gene from Caragana jubata.\nUsing rapid amplification of cDNA ends, a full length cDNA (CjLTI) was cloned from apical buds of Caragana jubata, a plant species that grows under extreme cold. The cDNA obtained was 573 bp long consisting of an open reading frame of 351 bp encoding 116 amino acids. Homology analysis did not exhibit significant similarity with any sequence at NCBI database, therefore it was deduced as a novel gene. Secondary structure analysis suggested that the deduced CjLTI contained 25.86% \u03b1-helices, 4.31% \u03b2-turns, 6.90% extended strands, and 62.93% random coils. The hydropathy profile suggested CjLTI to be a hydrophobic protein having characteristic features of signal peptides at N-terminus. The gene exhibited down-regulation at 5 min of exposure to low temperature (LT, 4 \u00b1 3 \u00b0C) followed by a strong up-regulation after 15 min and onwards. Methyl jasmonate (MJ) lead to up-regulation of CjLTI starting at 5 min onwards. The gene exhibited up- and down-regulation of expression pattern in response to abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA). Mild drought stress slightly up-regulated gene expression and at severe drought (up to 115% reduction in leaf water potential) slight down-regulation of gene expression was observed. These results suggested CjLTI to be a LT responsive gene wherein MJ, ABA and SA pathways might be involved in regulating the gene expression.", "Combined heart and lung autotransplantation and regulation of breathing.\nThe effects of en bloc autotransplantation of the heart and both lungs on the regulation of breathing were studied in four mongrel dogs. Tidal volume, respiratory rate, airflow, airway pressure and electromyograms from the intercostal muscles and diaphragm were recorded before and after the transplantation. The dogs breathed air or a mixture of 5% CO2 and air. Airway closure at functional residual capacity (FRC) level and after insufflation of 200 ml air was used as a mechanical stimulus. The following observations were made. 1) Stimulation by 5% CO2 after the transplantation increased the ventilatory minute volume by increasing the tidal volume while the respiratory rate remained unaltered. Before transplantation, both tidal volume and respiratory rate increased in response to CO2 stimulation. 2) After transplantation, stretching of the airways did not cause apnea (Hearing-Breuer reflex abolished) as it did preoperatively. 3) CO2 inhalation increased the efficiency of the respiratory muscles as expressed by the ratio of mechanical work (tidal volume or pressure impulse) to electrical activities of the respiratory muscles. This was most obvious in the dogs with transplant when the airways were closed at FRC level. Elimination of the afferent impulses due to en bloc transplantation of the heart and both lungs therefore modified the efferent impulses to the respiratory muscles. This effect was seen after both chemical and mechanical stimuli.", "Simultaneous imaging electron- and ion-feature Thomson scattering measurements of radiatively heated Xe.\nUniform density and temperature Xe plasmas have been produced over >4 mm scale-lengths using x-rays generated in a cylindrical Pb cavity. The cavity is 750 \u03bcm in depth and diameter, and is heated by a 300 J, 2 ns square, 1054 nm laser pulse focused to a spot size of 200 \u03bcm at the cavity entrance. The plasma is characterized by simultaneous imaging Thomson scattering measurements from both the electron and ion scattering features. The electron feature measurement determines the spatial electron density and temperature profile, and using these parameters as constraints in the ion feature analysis allows an accurate determination of the charge state of the Xe ions. The Thomson scattering probe beam is 40 J, 200 ps, and 527 nm, and is focused to a 100 \u03bcm spot size at the entrance of the Pb cavity. Each system has a spatial resolution of 25 \u03bcm, a temporal resolution of 200 ps (as determined by the probe duration), and a spectral resolution of 2 nm for the electron feature system and 0.025 nm for the ion feature system. The experiment is performed in a Xe filled target chamber at a neutral pressure of 3-10 Torr, and the x-rays produced in the Pb ionize and heat the Xe to a charge state of 20\u00b14 at up to 200 eV electron temperatures.", "Clinical analysis on argon plasma coagulation (APC) under painless colonoscopy for treatment of patients with colorectal polyp canceration.\nTo investigate the clinical effects of argon plasma coagulation combined high frequency electric knife in treating patients with colorectal polyp canceration. 56 patients diagnosed with colorectal polyp canceration were divided into control group (n=23) and observation group (n=33). Patients in the control group were treated with high frequency electric band ligation electroexcision while patients in observation group were treated with argon coagulation combined high frequency electric knife therapy. The patients were followed up for 6 months and, then, compared for their clinical effects and prognosis. The average diameter of the polyp, the ratios of sessile and flat polyps in observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group with p<0.05. While the differences in the ratio of adenomatous polyp, middle and high differentiated as well as leafless polyps between the two groups had no statistical significance with p>0.05. Further, the differences in operation completion rate and polyp resection rate at one time in observation group was significantly higher than those of control group while operative complication rate and operation time was significantly lower than those in the control group with p<0.05. Also, the differences in recurrence in situ and recurrence time did not differ significantly between the two groups. Treating colorectal polyps by argon plasma coagulation combined high frequency electric knife could extend polyp resection indication, along with improvement in the operation effect and reduction of complications.", "Insight into illness: impact on diagnosis and outcome of nonaffective psychosis.\nInsight is a reliably measured construct that is stable across cultures, with several aspects assessed frequently. Insight impairment in schizophrenia appears to be more stable than in mania and tends to be worse at all stages than other psychoses or \"at-risk states.\" Good insight may lead to temporary low mood and poor self-image, but these processes are complex and perhaps not the same at different stages of illness. Depression and hopelessness mediate insight's relationship with suicidality. Insight predicts low self-rating of quality of life but better observer rating and social function. It did not predict violence in one large study but did in shorter-term studies of forensic or first-admission populations. First-episode studies find consistent links with relapse and readmission but weak evidence of insight predicting symptoms or function at follow-up. Atypical antipsychotics were not specifically beneficial in one large trial, but cognitive-behavioral therapy was in another.", "Donor and recipient rat strains affect full-term development of one-cell zygotes cultured to morulae/blastocysts.\nThe present study was conducted to examine the developmental potential to offspring of rat embryos cultured from 1-cell to morula/blastocyst stage. Pronuclear zygotes from Wistar x Wistar or (SD x DA) x Wistar strains were cultured in modified rat 1-cell embryo culture medium (mR1ECM) for 96 h in 5% CO(2) in air at 37 C. The proportion of the 3-way cross hybrid zygotes developing into morula/blastocyst stage (74%) was higher than that of the Wistar zygotes (66%). Day-5 morulae/blastocysts developed in vitro were transferred into Day-3 or -4 pseudopregnant recipients of Wistar or SD x DA strain. The transfer of cultured embryos resulted in the birth of offspring at 13-59%, while that of non-cultured control blastocysts showed birth rates of 35-65%. The best offspring rate of cultured embryos (59%) was obtained when the hybrid 1-cell zygotes were cultured in mR1ECM medium and transferred into the 2-days earlier uteri of SD x DA recipients. These results suggest that genetic background of recipients as well as donors is a possible factor affecting full-term development of rat morulae/blastocysts derived from 1-cell stage zygotes cultured in vitro.", "Comparison between bone marrow transplantation and antithymocyte globulin in treatment of young patients with severe aplastic anemia.\nFifty-seven patients younger than 25 years with severe aplastic anemia underwent either bone marrow transplantation or antithymocyte globulin therapy (ATG) to ascertain which approach should be used in young patients. Thirty-five patients who had an HLA-identical sibling donor underwent bone marrow transplantation after conditioning with cyclophosphamide and low-dose total-body radiation. Twenty-two patients who did not have an HLA-identical donor received ATG. The 2-year actuarial survival of patients after transplant is 72% (95%, CI 64% to 80%), versus 45% (95%, CI 29% to 61%) in those given ATG therapy (P = 0.18). In those patients surviving 6 months after treatment, return of peripheral blood counts to normal values was more common in patients who received marrow transplant compared with those given ATG therapy (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, 24 of 26 transplant survivors had Karnofsky performance scores greater than 90%, compared with only five of 13 ATG survivors. These data suggest that bone marrow transplantation is the preferred therapy for severe aplastic anemia in young patients who have an HLA-identical sibling donor. ATG should be reversed for those young patients with severe aplastic anemia who do not have a histocompatible marrow donor.", "Effects of epidural anaesthesia on surgical stress-induced immunosuppression during upper abdominal surgery.\nPreviously, we have demonstrated that surgical stress rapidly induced transient hyporesponsiveness of blood cells to endotoxin and that monocyte mCD14 and HLA-DR expression decreased soon after the start of surgery under general anaesthesia. This study was designed to investigate the effects of epidural anaesthesia on surgical stress-induced immunosuppression in patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery. After having obtained informed consent, patients were randomly allocated to receive general anaesthesia (Group G) or general anaesthesia with epidural anaesthesia (Group E). Perioperative changes in neutrophil phagocytic activity, neutrophil respiratory burst activity, monocyte mCD14 and HLA-DR expression, plasma IL-10 concentration, and the LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in whole blood were measured. Surgical stress rapidly depressed neutrophil phagocytic activity, monocyte mCD14 and HLA-DR expression, and LPS-induced TNF-alpha production ex vivo (P < 0.05 vs preoperation) in both Group G and Group E. In contrast, the plasma IL-10 concentration increased significantly 2 h after the start of surgery (P < 0.05) in both groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups. The neutrophil respiratory burst activity did not change during the operation in either group. This study showed that the innate immune system is suppressed from the early period of upper abdominal surgery. Subgroup analysis suggested that epidural anaesthesia to T4 dermatome as well as general anaesthesia may not protect patients from this immunosuppression. These results in part explain the impairment of host-defense mechanisms seen in the perioperative period.", "Comparison of urine bag-changing regimens in elderly catheterised patients.\nDaily and weekly bag-changing regimens were compared in 12 elderly catheterised patients with reference to their clinical condition, leakage or blockage of the catheters, and the bacteriological state of the urine. Latex Foley catheters were used for the first 3 months and silastic catheters for the second 3 months of study. All patients had bacteriuria throughout the study, and the average number of bacterial species isolated from each specimen was 3.8. There were no significant clinical or bacteriological differences between the patients on daily and those on weekly bag change. Although significantly more episodes of pyrexia were recorded during latex than during silastic catheterisation there was no correlation between these episodes and the bacteriological state of the urine. Of the 9 courses of antibacterial treatment given during the 6 months, 7 were for indications other than urinary tract infection. There were no episodes of acute pyelonephritis. There were 148 episodes of pyrexia unrelated to any clinical symptoms or signs. Only 2 were treated with antibiotics; the remainder subsided without treatment.", "Contribution of pH, diprotonated phosphate and potassium for the reflex increase in blood pressure during handgrip.\nThe relative importance of pH, diprotonated phosphate (H2PO4-) and potassium (K+) for the reflex increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) during exercise was evaluated in seven subjects during rhythmic handgrip at 15 and 30% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), followed by post-exercise muscle ischaemia (PEMI). During 15% MVC, MAP rose from 92 +/- 1 to 103 +/- 2 mmHg, [K+] from 4.1 +/- 0.1 to 5.1 +/- 0.1 mmol L-1, while the intracellular (7.00 +/- 0.01 to 6.80 +/- 0.06) and venous pH fell (7.39 +/- 0.01 to 7.30 +/- 0.01) (P < 0.05). The intracellular [H2PO4-] increased 8.4 +/- 2 mmol kg-1 and the venous [H2PO4-] from 0.14 +/- 0.01 to 0.16 +/- 0.01 mmol L-1 (P < 0.05). During PEMI, MAP remained elevated along with the intracellular [H2PO4-] as well as a low intracellular and venous pH. However, venous [K+] and [H2PO4-] returned to the level at rest. During 30% MVC handgrip, MAP rose to 130 +/- 3 mmHg, [K+] to 5.8 +/- 0.2 mmol L-1, the intracellular and extracellular [H2PO4-] by 20 +/- 5 mmol kg-1 and to 0.20 +/- 0.02 mmol L-1, respectively, while the intracellular (6.33 +/- 0.06) and venous pH fell (7.23 +/- 0.02) (P < 0.05). During post-exercise muscle ischaemia all variables remained close to the exercise levels. Analysis of each variable as a predictor of blood pressure indicated that only the intracellular pH and diprotonated phosphate were linked to the reflex elevation of blood pressure during handgrip.", "Genome-wide association study combining pathway analysis for typical sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in Chinese Han populations.\nSporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive motor neuron death. Although the etiology of sALS remains unknown, genetic variants are thought to predispose individuals to the disease. Several recent genome-wide association studies have identified a number of loci that increase sALS susceptibility, but these only explain a small proportion of the disease. To extend the current genetic evidence and to identify novel candidates of sALS, we performed a pooling genome-wide association study by 859,311 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms of IlluminaHumanOmniZhongHua-8 combining pathway analysis in 250 typical sALS cases precluding age, clinical course, and phenotype interference and 250 control subjects from Chinese Han populations (CHP). The results revealed that 8 novel loci of 1p34.3, 3p21.1, 3p22.2, 10p15.2, 22q12.1, 3q13.11, 11q25, 12q24.33, and 5 previously reported loci of CNTN4 (kgp11325216), ATXN1 (kgp8327591), C9orf72 (kgp6016770), ITPR2 (kgp3041552), and SOD1 (kgp10760302) were associated with sALS from CHP. Furthermore, the pathway analysis based on the Gene Set Analysis Toolkit V2 showed that 10 top pathways were strongly associated with sALS from CHP, and among them, the 7 most potentially candidate pathways were phosphatidylinositol signaling system, Wnt signaling pathway, axon guidance, MAPK signaling pathway, neurotrophin signaling pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, and T-cell receptor signaling pathway, a total of 39 significantly associate genes in 7 candidate pathways was suggested to involve in the pathogenesis of sALS from CHP. In conclusion, our results revealed several new loci and pathways related to sALS from CHP and extend the association evidence for partial loci, genes, and pathways, which were previously identified in other populations. Thus, our data provided new clues for exploring the pathogenesis of sALS.", "Nucleic Acid Bioconjugates in Cancer Detection and Therapy.\nNucleoside- and nucleotide-based chemotherapeutics have been used to treat cancer for more than 50 years. However, their inherent cytotoxicities and the emergent resistance of tumors against treatment has inspired a new wave of compounds in which the overall pharmacological profile of the bioactive nucleic acid component is improved by conjugation with delivery vectors, small-molecule drugs, and/or imaging modalities. In this manner, nucleic acid bioconjugates have the potential for targeting and effecting multiple biological processes in tumors, leading to synergistic antitumor effects. Consequently, tumor resistance and recurrence is mitigated, leading to more effective forms of cancer therapy. Bioorthogonal chemistry has led to the development of new nucleoside bioconjugates, which have served to improve treatment efficacy en route towards FDA approval. Similarly, oligonucleotide bioconjugates have shown encouraging preclinical and clinical results. The modified oligonucleotides and their pharmaceutically active formulations have addressed many weaknesses of oligonucleotide-based drugs. They have also paved the way for important advancements in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Cancer-targeting ligands such as small-molecules, peptides, and monoclonal antibody fragments have all been successfully applied in oligonucleotide bioconjugation and have shown promising anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the application of bioorthogonal chemistry will, in all likelihood, continue to supply a promising pipeline of nucleic acid bioconjugates for applications in cancer detection and therapy.", "Routing is the process of selecting paths in a network for the purpose of directing network traffic along such paths. Routing may be performed for a variety of network types including, for example, electronic data exchange networks, telephone networks, and transportation networks. The goal of routing is to identify optimal paths through a network that fulfill network demands while minimizing costs and maximizing network efficiency. When the number of nodes in a given network is too large, finding global optimal solutions for these paths may be difficult, and in some instances it may be impossible.\nTraditionally, these optimal paths were merely approximated using a variety of approximating techniques (e.g., genetic algorithm, ant colony algorithm, simulated annealing, etc.). However, these existing methods are computationally expensive because they must be repeatedly executed to achieve the approximation. Further, these approximations converge very slowly on the solution, and these existing methods often assume that the demands of the network are static. As a result, these existing solutions often fail to fulfill the ever-changing demands of a network.", "Impact of PICALM and CLU on hippocampal degeneration.\nPICALM and CLU are two major risk genes of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), and there is strong molecular evidence suggesting their interaction on amyloid-beta deposition, hence finding functional dependency between their risk genotypes may lead to better understanding of their roles in LOAD development and greater clinical utility. In this study, we mainly investigated interaction effects of risk loci PICALM rs3581179 and CLU rs11136000 on hippocampal degeneration in both young and elderly adults in order to understand their neural mechanism on aging process, which may help identify robust biomarkers for early diagnosis and intervention. Besides volume we also assessed hippocampal shape phenotypes derived from diffeomorphic metric mapping and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In elderly individuals (75.6 \u00b1 6.7 years) significant interaction effects existed on hippocampal volume (P < 0.001), whereas in young healthy adults (19.4 \u00b1 1.1 years) such effects existed on a shape phenotype (P = 0.01) indicating significant variation at hippocampal head and tail that mirror most AD vulnerable regions. Voxel-wise analysis also pointed to the same regions but lacked statistical power. In both cohorts, PICALM protective genotype AA only exhibited protective effects on hippocampal degeneration and cognitive performance when combined with CLU protective T allele, but adverse effects with CLU risk CC. This study revealed novel PICALM and CLU interaction effects on hippocampal degeneration along aging, and validated effectiveness of diffeomorphometry in imaging genetics study.

SAR limitations are minimized by technical advances and surface coils are available for all core applications. With appropriate adjustments to scanning protocols, one can master the challenges of scanning at 3T; studies of the brain, spine, chest, abdomen, pelvis, vasculature, and extremities can be consistently higher in quality than are those obtained at 1.5T. The superior studies that are obtainable at 3T have great appeal to clinicians who are sophisticated about MR technology in areas, such as neurology, orthopedics, vascular surgery, and oncology,and encourage a shift in referrals toward practices that invest in higher field technology. The greater sensitivity to magnetic susceptibility offers unique benefits in functional neuroimaging, and available software/hardware packages enhance clinical setting feasibility, which adds a source of new referrals. The greater overall signal of 3T can be manipulated to make scanning more comfortable and with less motion artifact because scan times could be half as long. Spectacular anatomic delineation that is provided by high-definition scanning at true 1024 resolution can improve preoperative assessment and may improve sensitivity to smaller lesions. 3T provides practices with an advantage that is sought increasingly by high field strength purchasers in a competitive market. Only cost considerations stand in the way of the eventual domination of 3T systems in the high field strength market.", "Task demands and segment priming effects in the naming task.\nA central issue in the study of speech production is whether phonological encoding occurs sequentially or in parallel. Some of the strongest evidence for sequential phonological encoding comes from the number of segments primed effect-response latencies decrease when increasing the number of primed segments from 0 to 1 to 2 (e.g., Meyer, 1991). Although it is often assumed that all participants adopt the same response criterion in the naming task, standard instructions can lead to the strategic adoption of different response criteria (such as an initial segment-based criterion or a syllable-based criterion). Furthermore, the number of segments primed effect might be driven by the manner of the initial segment such as the acoustic characteristics of plosives. In this study, participants named monosyllabic words varying in initial segment plosivity in a 0, 1, or 2 segments primed naming task and were instructed in ways to induce either a segment or syllable criterion. Data were analyzed by acoustic latency, articulatory latency, and initial segment duration, as distinguishing between a segment and syllable criterion and sequential and parallel encoding requires more than just a single point in the time-course of articulation. Shorter acoustic latencies when priming 2 segments over 1 were contingent on the manner of the initial segment and the adoption of a segment criterion, clarifying the nature of the number of segments primed effect. Moreover, the similar acoustic latencies found across priming conditions when a syllable criterion was adopted support parallel phonological encoding.

IcsA, an outer membrane protein, is localized to the old pole of the bacterium and is both necessary and sufficient for actin assembly. IcsA is slowly cleaved from the bacterial surface by the protease IcsP (SopA). Absence of IcsP leads to an alteration in the distribution of surface IcsA, such that the polar cap is maintained and some IcsA is distributed along the lateral walls of the bacillus. The mechanism of unipolar localization of IcsA and the role of IcsP in its unipolar localization are incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that cleavage of IcsA occurs exclusively in the outer membrane and that IcsP is localized to the outer membrane. In addition, we show that IcsA at the old pole is susceptible to cleavage by IcsP and that native IcsP is active at the pole. Taken together, these data indicate that IcsP cleaves IcsA over the entire bacterial surface. Finally, we show that, immediately after induction from a tightly regulated promoter, IcsA is expressed exclusively at the old pole in both the icsP- icsA- and the icsA- background. These data demonstrate that unipolar localization of IcsA results from its direct targeting to the pole, followed by its diffusion laterally in the outer membrane.", "Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist attenuates regional neuronal cell death and cognitive dysfunction after experimental brain injury.\nThe effect of systemic administration of human recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (rhIL-1ra) on behavioral outcome and histopathologic damage after lateral fluid-percussion brain injury of moderate severity was evaluated. In study 1, brain-injured Sprague Dawley rats received timed subcutaneous injections beginning 15 minutes after injury of either 100 mg/kg rhIL-1ra (high dose, total dose = 1900 mg/kg), 10 mg/kg rhIL-1ra (low dose, total dose = 190 mg/kg), or vehicle over 7 days. No effect of low-dose rhIL-1ra was observed in study 1. High-dose rhIL-1ra significantly attenuated posttraumatic neuronal loss in the injured hippocampal CA3 region (P < 0.05), dentate hilus (P < 0.05), and cortex (P < 0.05) but impaired recovery of motor function at 7 days after trauma (P < 0.05). In study 2, rats were pretrained to learn a visuospatial task in a Morris water maze, subjected to fluid-percussion brain injury or sham treatment, and randomly assigned to receive multiple subcutaneous injections at timed intervals of 100 mg/kg rhIL-1ra (total dose = 900 mg/kg) or vehicle over 42 hours, followed by continuous infusion of a lower concentration of rhIL-1ra (20 mg/kg/day, total dose = 100 mg/kg), or vehicle for 5 days using subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps. Postinjury administration of rhIL-1ra significantly attenuated cognitive deficits compared with vehicle-treated animals at 42 hours (P < 0.05) but did not affect motor function at 48 hours, 1 week, and 2 weeks. These results suggest that inhibitors of cytokine pathways may be therapeutically useful for the treatment of brain trauma.", "Acylated-naproxen as the surface-active template in the preparation of micro- and nanospherical imprinted xerogels by emulsion techniques.\nA strategy based on water-in-oil emulsion for the dispersion of a sol-gel mixture into small droplets was employed with the view of the production of naproxen-imprinted micro- and nanospheres. The procedure, aiming at a surface imprinting process, comprised the synthesis of a naproxen-derived surfactant. The imprinting process occurred at the interface of the emulsions or microemulsions, by the migration of the NAP-surfactant head into the sol-gel drops to leave surficial imprints due mainly to ion-pair interaction with a cationic group contained within the growing sol-gel network. The surface-imprinted microspheric particles exhibited a log-normal size distribution with geometric mean diameter of 3.1\u03bcm. A mesoporous texture was found from measurements of the specific surface area (206m(2)/g) and pore diameter (Dp 2nm). Evaluation of the microspheres as packed HPLC stationary phases resulted in the determination of the selectivity factor against ibuprofen (\u03b1=2.1), demonstrating the successful imprinting. Chromatographic efficiency, evaluated by the number of theoretical plates (222platescm(-3)), emerged as an outstanding feature among the set of all relatable formats produced before, an advantage intrinsic to the location of the imprinted sites on the surface. The material presented a capacity of 3.2\u03bcmolg(-1). Additionally, exploratory work conducted on their nanoscale counterparts resulted in the production of nanospheres in the size order of 10nm providing good indications of a successful imprinting process.", "A potentiometric tattoo sensor for monitoring ammonium in sweat.\nThe development and analytical characterization of a novel ion-selective potentiometric cell in a temporary-transfer tattoo platform for monitoring ammonium levels in sweat is presented. The fabrication of this skin-worn sensor, which is based on a screen-printed design, incorporates all-solid-state potentiometric sensor technology for both the working and reference electrodes, in connection to ammonium-selective polymeric membrane based on the nonactin ionophore. The resulting tattooed potentiometric sensor exhibits a working range between 10(-4) M to 0.1 M, well within the physiological levels of ammonium in sweat. Testing under stringent mechanical stress expected on the epidermis shows that the analytical performance is not affected by factors such as stretching or bending. Since the levels of ammonium are related to the breakdown of proteins, the new wearable potentiometric tattoo sensor offers considerable promise for monitoring sport performance or detecting metabolic disorders in healthcare. Such combination of the epidermal integration, screen-printed technology and potentiometric sensing represents an attractive path towards non-invasive monitoring of a variety of electrolytes in human perspiration.", "Ambulance paramedic activities in North Ayrshire: a five-year review.\nAmbulance paramedics have been practising in North Ayrshire for some time. The aim of this study was to determine the range and number of procedures that are undertaken by paramedics, and whether they are performed in accordance with standard operating procedures. A five-year prospective observational study of patients attended by paramedics in a mixed urban/rural area of south-west Scotland. Data were collected on all procedures undertaken in the prehospital arena. A single investigator decided whether each procedure was performed in accordance with standard operating procedures in the light of available information. Data on 6600 patients were available, a mean of 42 patients per paramedic per year. Oxygen administration increased significantly and the number of occasions when excess time was spent on scene decreased significantly during the study. Paramedics treated significantly fewer patients requiring intravenous cannulation, intubation, defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation in year 5 compared with year 1. Paramedics administered drugs in accordance with standard operating procedures in almost all cases. Paramedic exposure to extended skills is low in this region, leading to concerns about advanced skills retention. Paramedics can administer drugs appropriately according to protocol. Increasing paramedic experience, possibly augmented by feedback via audit, may be influencing paramedic decision making.", "Intravenous anti-MRSA phosphatiosomes mediate enhanced affinity to pulmonary surfactants for effective treatment of infectious pneumonia.\nThe aim of this study was to develop PEGylated phosphatidylcholine (PC)-rich nanovesicles (phosphatiosomes) carrying ciprofloxacin (CIPX) for lung targeting to eradicate extracellular and intracellular methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Soyaethyl morphonium ethosulfate (SME) was intercalated in the nanovesicle surface with the dual goals of achieving strengthened bactericidal activity of CIPX-loaded phosphatiosomes and delivery to the lungs. The isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) results proved the strong association of SME phosphatiosomes with pulmonary surfactant. We demonstrated a superior anti-MRSA activity of SME phosphatiosomes compared to plain phosphatiosomes and to free CIPX. A synergistic effect of CIPX and SME nanocarriers was found in the biofilm eradication. SME phosphatiosomes were readily engulfed by the macrophages, restricting the intracellular MRSA count by 1-2 log units. SME phosphatiosomes efficiently accumulated in the lungs after intravenous injection. In a rat model of lung infection, the MRSA burden in the lungs could be decreased by 8-fold after SME nanosystem application.", "Computing rovibrational levels of methane with curvilinear internal vibrational coordinates and an Eckart frame.\nWe present a new procedure for computing a rovibrational spectrum of a polyatomic molecule and apply it to methane. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is solved, numerically exactly, by using a nested contracted basis. Rovibrational wavefunctions are computed in a |v>|JKM> basis, where |v> is a vibrational wavefunction and |JKM> is a symmetric top wavefunction. In turn, the |v> are obtained by solving a vibrational Schr\u00f6dinger equation with basis functions that are products of contracted bend and stretch functions. At all stages of the calculation we exploit parity symmetry. The calculations are done in internal coordinates that facilitate the treatment of large amplitude motion. An Eckart molecule-fixed frame is used by numerically computing coefficients of the kinetic energy operator. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated by calculating a large number of converged J = 10 methane rovibrational levels in the Tetradecad polyad. No previous calculation of rovibrational levels of methane includes as many levels as we report in this paper.", "Generally, it is well known to provide a subsurface well safety valve for use in a well for shutting off flow of well fluids through the well tubing. U.S. Pat. No. 4,161,219 issued July 17, 1979, discloses a piston actuated safety valve which is biased to an open position and is closed in response to hydraulic fluid applied from the well surface. In that valve the fluid pressure in the well conduit acts against the piston and cylinder assembly in a direction to move the valve to a closed position. However, in that case the pressure in the well conduit or tubing is working against the hydraulic control fluid from the surface which requires increased hydraulic control pressure acting against a tubing or conduit pressure which is undesirable, as well as variable, in some applications.\nThe present invention is directed to an improved piston and cylinder actuated subsurface safety valve in which the well pressure in the well conduit or tubing does not affect the opening or closing of the safety valve and thus provides a so-called balanced valve insofar as the effect of well tubing pressure is concerned.", "Three-dimensional MRI of the glenoid labrum.\nThe objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reformation in the evaluation of tears of the glenoid labrum complex (GLC). Fifty-five shoulders were evaluated by MRI using standard spin-echo sequences. Gradient-refocused-echo axial projections were used to assess the GLC on the two-dimensional (2D) studies. Three-dimensional Fourier transform multiplanar gradient-recalled imaging with a resolution of 0.7 mm was also performed in all patients. Independent analyses of the anterior and posterior labra were performed in a blinded manner for both the 2D and 3D studies by three experienced musculoskeletal radiologists. Observations of the imaging studies were compared with the videoarthroscopic findings. The appearance of the GLC was rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (0-2 = normal, 3, 4 = abnormal or torn). The diagnostic confidence was averaged from the three reader's scores. Anterior labral tears were effectively detected with sensitivities of 89% and 96% and specificities of 96% and 100% (P < 0.0001) for the 2D and 3D studies, respectively. For posterior labral tears, the sensitivity and specificity of the 2D method were 47% and 98%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the 3D volume sequence were 53% and 98%, respectively. The lower sensitivity of both imaging methods for detecting posterior labral tears may be influenced by the smaller number (n = 5) of arthroscopically confirmed cases in our study and reflects the difficulty of visualizing the posteroinferior borders of the GLC with present MRI techniques.", "[Summary and lessons of the European and Hungarian measles situation].\nMeasles is one of the most serious preventable infectious diseases, which in our country were among the rare diseases in the last 10 to 20 years. One of the reasons for this is that the Hungarian population born after 1969 was vaccinated in almost 99 percent. The other reason is that in the period prior to vaccination era, the often-occurring measles epidemics left life-long immunity in the affected persons. Thus, natural and artificial immunizations provided extensive herd immunity. However, the ongoing measles epidemics in Europe have highlighted the fact that the symptoms and differential diagnosis related to measles have been relegated to the negligible category for the last 20 years. In addition to reviewing the consequences of the European measles pandemics in Hungary, the purpose of this paper is to revise and summarize the clinical and laboratory knowledge required to establish a definitive epidemiological control of measles. Orv Hetil. 2019; 160(20): 767-773.", "Subjective experiences of family caregivers of patients with dementia as predictive factors of quality of life.\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate predictive factors of quality of life (QOL) in home caregivers of patients with dementia. A total of 118 home caregivers (48 male, 70 female) were asked to complete the World Health Organization (WHO) Quality of Life 26 (WHO/QOL-26) questionnaire, the Pines Burnout Measure (BM), and the Beck Depression Inventory, second edition (BDI-II). Patient demographics and clinical data regarding cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and dementia severity were obtained from medical records. Spearman rank correlation coefficients revealed that caregiver QOL was significantly correlated with patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms (r=-0.19; P < 0.05), as well as depressive symptoms (r=-0.59, P < 0.01) and burnout (r=-0.59, P < 0.01) in caregivers. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that depressive symptoms in caregivers was the strongest predictor for caregiver QOL (R(2) = 0.37, P < 0.001) and that caregiver QOL was best predicted by the combination of depressive symptoms, burnout, and the cognitive impairment of patients (R(2) = 0.46, P < 0.05). The results of the present study demonstrate that subjective experiences of caregivers are more strongly correlated with caregiver QOL than patient-related variables and are thus powerful determinants of caregiver QOL. These findings suggest that caregiver intervention, which aims to increase QOL, may benefit from the incorporation of strategies to reduce depressive symptoms and burnout.", "[MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ALLANTOIC PLACENTA IN RATS WITH EXPERIMENTAL LIVER DAMAGE].\nThe aim of the study was an analysis of the peculiarities of morphological changes of the placenta in rats with experimental chronic hepatic lesion. Liver injury was modeled in 3-month-old sexually mature female rats by 2-fold intragastric administration of paracetamol at a dose of 2.5 g/kg body weight (drug group, n=15) and a single intraperitoneal injection of D-galactosamine at a dose of 250 mg/kg of body weight (toxic group, n=15). Intact rats served as a control. The placenta examined at Day 21 of pregnancy using histological and morphometric methods. \u0420roliferative activity of placental cells was evaluated with the immunocytochemical method using antibodies against Ki-67 antigen. The membrane permeability in different trophoblast compartments was examined. It was found that experimental chronic liver pathology caused morphological changes in the placenta, which were manifested by a decrease in the area of its labyrinthine portion, maternal sinusoids in the basal area, fetal capillaries and maternal lacunae of the labyrinth. In addition, in the experiments with an intraperitoneal injection of trypan blue it was shown that changes in the liver caused increased permeability of the placental barrier, and reduced the proliferative activity of trophoblast cells.", "Antigen-presenting T cells. II. Clonal responses of alloreactive and virus-specific self-restricted human cytotoxic T cell responses stimulated by T lymphoblasts.\nThe capacity of various stimulator cell types to present alloantigens or viral antigens to resting human CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocyte precursors (CLP) was analyzed in a limiting dilution culture system. Cell sorter-separated T lymphoblasts of both CD4+ and CD8+ phenotypes but not resting T cells were found to efficiently stimulate the clonal development of allogeneic CD8+ CLP. Thus, 5000 CD4+ T lymphoblasts activated as many (one out of 200 to one out of 300) allogeneic CLP as 50,000 peripheral blood mononuclear stimulator cells. This potent stimulator activity was found in CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphoblasts activated by mitogen, anti-T3 monoclonal antibody, or mixed leukocyte reactions. Cytotoxic T cells generated in this system were highly specific for HLA class I antigens. Furthermore, T lymphoblasts infected with mumps virus efficiently induced development of autologous CLP into CTL clones that were virus specific and self-HLA restricted, as shown by split-well analysis. The possible in vivo significance of antigen-presenting T lymphoblasts is discussed.", "[Before and after implementation of do-not-resuscitate orders in a stroke unit].\nIn Norway, few studies have been done to map the extent of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders and the consequence for patients (treatment and outcome). All patients with DNR orders, referred to the stroke unit of Akershus University Hospital during the year 2005, were identified and data on treatment and outcome were recorded. A DNR order was found for 79 of 855 (9 %) patients (mean age 80 years [SD 9]). Reasons for referral to hospital were: cerebral infarction (49 [62 %] patients), intracerebral haemorrhage (28 [35 %] patients), and other diseases (2 [3 %] patients). Mean NIH Stroke Scale was 19 (SD 6) (scale 0 - 42; 0 in score meaning no stroke related symptoms). Hospital mortality was 39/79 (49 %). Apart from once, all decisions regarding withholding and/or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment were taken in the aftermath of a DNR order. For 43 patients (54 %), treatment was limited in some way and hospital mortality for this group was 27/43 (63 %). Mortality was 12/36 (33 %) for those who had full treatment. 45 patients (57 %) with a DNR order had a bacterial infection and 32 of them were treated with antibiotics (71 %). Patients with DNR orders were old and had had severe stroke. Treatment was rarely withheld despite high morbidity and mortality among the patients.", "Differential deletion of GDNF in the auditory system leads to altered sound responsiveness.\nGlial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been proposed as a potent neurotrophic factor with the potential to cure neurodegenerative diseases. In the cochlea, GDNF has been detected in auditory neurons and sensory receptor cells and its expression is upregulated upon trauma. Moreover, the application of GDNF in different animal models of deafness has shown its capacity to prevent hearing loss and promoted its future use in therapeutic trials in humans. In the present study we have examined the endogenous requirement of GDNF during auditory development in mice. Using a lacZ knockin allele we have confirmed the expression of GDNF in the cochlea including its sensory regions during development. Global inactivation of GDNF throughout the hearing system using a Foxg1-Cre line causes perinatal lethality but reveals no apparent defects during formation of the cochlea. Using TrkC-Cre and Atoh1-Cre lines, we were able to generate viable mutants lacking GDNF in auditory neurons or both auditory neurons and sensory hair cells. These mutants show normal frequency-dependent auditory thresholds. However, mechanoelectrical response properties of outer hair cells (OHCs) in TrkC-Cre GDNF mutants are altered at low thresholds. Furthermore, auditory brainstem wave analysis shows an abnormal increase of wave I. On the other hand, Atoh1-Cre GDNF mutants show normal OHC function but their auditory brainstem wave pattern is reduced at the levels of wave I, III and IV. These results show that GDNF expression during the development is required to maintain functional hearing at different levels of the auditory system.", "Application of novel nanotechnology strategies in plant biotransformation: a contemporary overview.\nDuring the past epoch we have gone through the remarkable progress in plant gene transformation technology. The production of transgenic plants is considered as a valuable tool in plant research and the technology is extensively applied in phytomedicines and agricultural research. Gene transformation in plants is normally carried out by Agrobacterium species, application of some chemicals and physical techniques (electroporation, microprojectile, etc.). Now a days with better efficacy and reproducibility, novel technologies for the direct gene transfer like liposome, positively charged liposome (lipofectin) and nanoparticle based delivery systems are used for genetic transformation of plants. In this review, we have enlightened the novel nanotechnologies like liposome, Carbon nano-tube and nanoparticles with their current status and future prospects in transgenic plant development. Moreover, we have also highlighted the limitations of conventional techniques of gene transfer. Furthermore, we have tried to postulate innovative ideas on the footprints of established nanotechnology and chemical based strategy with improved efficacy, reproducibility and accuracy along with less time consumption.", "The most serious problem confronting the profession of nursing is a national nursing shortage. While there are several factors that have created the current shortage, one important factor is the work situation. It is commonly believed that the structure and lack of rewards associated with many hospital nursing jobs reduces autonomy, work motivation and turnover. In addition, nurses who are unhappy do not recruit new members into the profession and may not perform well on the job. Research that investigates work related factors that may affect the recruitment, retention, and performance of nurses is certainly timely. The availability of a unique data set with the key variables of concern to the profession makes possible research on a number of problems of both theoretical and practical significance. The specific aim of the proposed research is to conduct a secondary analysis of the data and submit for publication within the next two years eight manuscripts related to nurse retention. The specific topics are as follows: 1) changing job satisfaction, commitment, and professionalism; 2) an event history analysis of nursing turnover; 3) the relationship between job performance and turnover; 4) a valid and reliable measure of nurses' job satisfaction; 5) variables related to nurses' job performance; 6) an instrument to measure nurses' job conflict; 7) conflict in newly employed hospital nurses; and 8) autonomy of newly employed nurses. The sample to be studied is 320 newly employed nurses followed over their first year of work. Data analysis will include using standard descriptive statistics, as well as a variety of inferential statistics: chi-square, LISREL, t-tests, analysis of variance, multivariate regression, factor analysis, and event history analysis.", "Crocin, a dietary colorant, mitigates cyclophosphamide-induced organ toxicity by modulating antioxidant status and inflammatory cytokines.\nThis study investigated the protective efficacy of crocin against hepatotoxicity induced by cyclophosphamide (CP) in Wistar rats. The experimental rats were treated with crocin orally at a dose of 10 mg/kg for 6 consecutive days after the administration of a single intraperitoneal dose of CP (150 mg/kg). The ameliorative effect of crocin on organ toxicity was studied by evaluating oxidative stress enzymes, inflammatory cytokines and histological sections. A single intraperitoneal CP injection significantly elevated endogenous reactive oxygen species and oxidation of lipids and proteins, which are the hallmarks of oxidative damage in liver and serum. In consequence, the primary defensive reduced glutathione, total thiol and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase, were significantly reduced. In addition, liver and serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase along with acid and alkaline phosphatase were considerably increased. Oral administration of crocin significantly rejuvenated all the above altered markers to almost normal state. The protective efficacy of crocin was further supported by the histological assessment and restoration of CP-induced inflammatory cytokines and enzyme levels compared with the control drug. The results obtained suggest the protective nature of crocin against CP-induced oxidative damage/inflammation and organ toxicity.", "Secretion of an insulinotropic factor from isolated, perfused rat intestine.\nTo examine gut-islet interrelationships, we entirely separated the gastrointestinal tract from the rat. When we arterially perfused this preparation with an erythrocyte-free solution for 1 h, it remained histologically intact and took up oxygen and glucose. Feedings were given via a duodenal tube. The gut absorbed glucose when glucose in the feeding was high (9.2 g/dl), but not when glucose in the feeding was low (58 mg/dl). With feeding, the portal venous effluent (PVE) from this preparation (stomach to ileum) enhanced late-phase, glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreas of another rat. This enhancement occurred when the gut was fed either glucose (9.2 g/dl) in electrolyte solution or electrolyte solution alone. PVE from glucose-fed upper gut (stomach, duodenum) was similarly insulinotropic. In contrast, PVE from unfed gut or from glucose-fed gut of old rats was not insulinotropic. PVE from all gut preparations except upper gut produced a glucagon \"spike\" during basal pancreatic perfusion. Effects of gastrointestinal peptides (gastric inhibitory polypeptide, cholecystokinin octapeptide, secretin, gastrin) and immunoassays of PVE suggested that the insulinotropic substance is not one of these peptides. Thus, an insulinotropic substance that is not dependent on feeding nutrient material is secreted from the intestine.", "Using concept maps to optimize the composition of collaborative student groups: a pilot study.\nThe aim of this paper is to stimulate interest in the practical classroom application of concept mapping strategies as an approach that teachers can easily use to enhance collaborative learning. Concept mapping has been developed as a tool to support meaningful learning. However, much of the research literature fails to explain how concept maps might be most gainfully employed within the classroom. As a result, concept mapping is a tool that is under-used. Students on a postgraduate teacher preparation programme for nurses were arranged in triads on the basis of the morphology of individually-produced concept maps for the topics of 'genetics' and 'pathogenic microbes'. They were arranged in heterogeneous triads to produce a consensus map for 'pathogenic microbes', and then in homogeneous triads to produce a consensus map for 'genetics'. The number of acceptable propositions found in their individual maps was compared with the number found in the consensus group maps, and gain scores were calculated for each participant. Participants arranged in triads of individuals having very different knowledge structures were found to make a greater improvement than those arranged in triads composed of individuals with qualitatively similar knowledge structures. The study was undertaken with a very small sample and only looked at two topic areas. However, the findings support the idea that collaborative groups work most effectively when individuals within the group bring different perspectives to a problem, and that this perspective can be usefully identified within the classroom environment as variations in concept map morphology.", "Two-dimensional Doppler echocardiographic correlation of dipyridamole-thallium stress testing with isometric handgrip.\nTo determine how frequently new wall-motion abnormalities that are indicative of ischemia accompany thallium redistribution, 47 consecutive patients underwent two-dimensional echocardiography during routine dipyridamole-thallium stress testing. A secondary aim of the study was to determine whether the addition of isometric handgrip exercises to the standard dipyridamole imaging protocol increased the frequency of wall-motion abnormalities or thallium redistribution. Echocardiograms and thallium scans were independently interpreted, and wall-motion abnormalities that appeared with dipyridamole, handgrip exercise, or both were compared with results of thallium imaging. Five of 24 patients with thallium redistribution had new wall-motion abnormalities, and the extent (number of segments) of thallium redistribution in these five patients was significantly greater than in those who did not have well-motion abnormalities (p less than 0.03). The addition of isometric handgrip exercises to the imaging protocol did not distinguish between patients with and without new wall-motion abnormalities or thallium redistribution. Thus new wall-motion abnormalities infrequently accompany thallium redistribution in routine dipyridamole stress testing in spite of the addition of handgrip exercises, but when new wall-motion abnormalities are present, they are associated with a greater area of thallium redistribution.", "Microevolutionary response of a gut nematode to intestinal inflammation.\nParasitic helminths interfere with the immune response of their hosts to establish long-lasting, chronic infections. While favorable to the parasite, the capacity to dampen the immune response can also provide a benefit to the host in terms of reduced risk of immune disorders and immunopathology. The immunomodulatory role of nematodes has been exploited in clinical trials to treat a number of inflammatory and immune diseases. However, how parasites adapt to an inflammatory environment remains a poorly explored question. Here, we conducted a serial passage experiment where the gut nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus was maintained for nine generations in mice with a drug-induced intestinal inflammation or in control hosts. The life history traits of parasites from the selected lines were assessed in hosts that were either exposed to the inflammatory environment or kept as controls. In addition to the nematode life history traits, we assessed the severity of the intestinal inflammation. We found that H. polygyrus adapted to the inflammatory environment through both plastic and microevolutionary responses. In particular, per capita fecundity was globally enhanced in worms that experienced intestinal inflammation and that were selected in the inflammatory environment. Interestingly, we also found that worms selected in the inflammatory environment were better able, after nine generations of selection, to alleviate the inflammatory symptoms. This latter result further highlights the potential therapeutic role of gut nematodes in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.", "PicSOr: an objective test of perceptual skill that predicts laparoscopic technical skill in three initial studies of laparoscopic performance.\nLaparoscopic surgery requires surgeons to infer the shape of 3-D structures, such as the internal organs of patients, from 2-D displays on a video monitor. Recent evidence indicates that the issue is not resolved by the use of contemporary 3-D camera systems. It is therefore crucial to find ways of measuring differences in aptitude for recovering 3-D structure from 2-D images, and assessing its impact on performance. Our aim was to test empirically for a relationship between laparoscopic ability and the perceptual skill of recovering information about 3-D structures from 2-D monitor displays. Participants in three studies completed a simulated laparoscopic cutting task as well as the Pictorial Surface Orientation (PicSOr)3 Test. In studies 1 (n = 48) and 2 (n = 32) both groups were laparoscopic novices, and in study 3 (n = 34) 18 of the participants were experienced laparoscopic surgeons. All three studies showed that PicSOr consistently predicted the laparoscopic performance of participants on the laparoscopic cutting task (study 1, r = 0.5, p < 0.0003; study 2, r = 0.5, p < 0.004; and study 3, r = 0.42, p = 0.017). Furthermore, it was also a significant predictor of laparoscopic surgeons' performance (r = 0.54, p = 0.047). This is the first objective perceptual psychometric test to reliably predict laparoscopic technical skills. PicSOr provides a tool for assessing which trainees have the potential to learn minimal access surgery.", "Spatial relationship between high-dominant-frequency sites and the linear ablation line in persistent atrial fibrillation: its impact on complex fractionated electrograms.\nComplex fractionated electrograms (CFEs) and high-dominant-frequency (DF) sites theoretically represent abnormal substrates and targets for atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. The relationship between the high-DF sites in the left atrium (LA) and commonly used linear ablation line to the distribution of the CFEs in patients with persistent AF is unknown. This study enrolled 62 persistent AF patients who underwent construction of LA CFE and DF maps (>350 points/map). Circumferential pulmonary vein isolation and linear ablation including that at the septum, roof, mitral-annulus, and ridge of the appendage were performed. Multipolar catheter mapping identified sites with high DFs (\u2265 8 Hz) in all patients (9.8 \u00b1 4.6/patient). In 47 patients in whom AF persisted despite ablation, there was a significant reduction in the continuous CFE (<50 ms) burden after the linear ablation (62 vs.11%; P < 0.0001), with a decrease in both the DF within the coronary sinus (6.9 \u00b1 0.9 vs. 5.9 \u00b1 0.8 Hz; P < 0.0001) and CFE surface area (42.8 \u00b1 18.8 vs. 12.6 \u00b1 10.5 cm(2); P < 0.0001). Comparing the high-DF sites with the ablated lesions, 64% of the high-DF sites (324 of 507) were on or adjacent to the ablation lines. Residual CFEs were observed in the infero-posterior regions in 83% of the patients. Almost half of the high-DF sites away from the linear ablation line were identified in the inferior (34%) and posterior (14%) LA regions. Linear ablation resulted in the localization of the continuous CFE regions and reduced the global LA DF in patients with persistent AF. This may be related to the proximity relationship between the linear ablation lines and high-DF sites except for in the infero-posterior regions.", "Functional characterization of human breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) expressed in the oocytes of Xenopus laevis.\nTo evaluate the function and substrate specificity of human breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) in the absence of cofactors or heterologous partner proteins, Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with cRNA of wild-type or mutant (R482T) BCRP. High expression of BCRP was observed on the oocyte surface. Accumulation and efflux assays revealed that oocytes expressing R482T transported daunorubicin (DNR), mitoxantrone (MX), rhodamine 123, and flavopiridol (FLV), whereas wild-type BCRP transported only MX and FLV, in agreement with observations in mammalian and other systems. Transport activity was completely inhibited by fumitremorgin C, a known inhibitor of BCRP. Injection of oocytes with cRNA containing mutations of serine 187 in the ATP-binding cassette signature motif (S187T or S187A) resulted in strong expression of the mutant forms; however, these oocytes were devoid of transporter activity. When oocytes were coinjected with R482T and R482T/S187T, DNR transport was inhibited in a manner dependent on the amount of R482T/S187T cRNA added, consistent with the idea that the active form of BCRP is a homodimer or homomultimer. Substrate interaction studies found that no two substrates reciprocally inhibited the efflux of the other. Although FLV proved to be an effective inhibitor of both MX and DNR transport, and MX inhibited DNR transport, the other substrates tested had only weak or no inhibitory activity, indicating a complex nature of substrate interaction with the BCRP homodimer. We conclude that the X. laevis oocyte heterologous expression system is a valid and effective means of studying BCRP function and substrate specificity.", "Update:My phone became a tank!This is what I've created, using:- ZeroLemon 9300 mAh battery.The ZeroLemon case is perfect, it envelopes the phone perfectly with a gigantic SD card inside, everything fits.The case is nice and soft, yet hardshell, allowing the card to fit inside.There is a slight bulge on the back of the phone, where the SD card resides.The phone is a power beast now.

By using transmission electron microscopy analyses and spreading resistance measurements we investigated the dependence of the etching selectivity on the different parameters of the electrochemical cell, i.e., bias voltage and chemical solution. In B-doped samples immersed in buffered HF, the increase of bias voltage from 0.5 to 1 V produces a slight improvement of the etching selectivity and a B concentration as low as 1 x 10(17) cm(-3) can be successfully delineated at 1 V. A further improvement is achieved by using HF:HNO(3):CH(3)COOH or HF:HCl chemical mixtures for which the delineation sensitivity approaches the value of 1 x 10(16) cm(-3). In buffered HF As-doped regions can be delineated to a concentration of 2 x 10(17) cm(-3), independently of the bias voltage, in the range 2-4 V. These results were used to measure the 2D doping diffusion profiles in silicon wafers patterned with polycrystalline Si strips and implanted with As or B, by using different tilt and twist angles. The high resolution of the electrochemical delineation allowed us to evaluate very accurately the effects of the implant angles on the lateral doping distribution.", "Extended ellipse-line-ellipse trajectory for long-object cone-beam imaging with a mounted C-arm system.\nRecent reports show that three-dimensional cone-beam (CB) imaging with a floor-mounted (or ceiling-mounted) C-arm system has become a valuable tool in interventional radiology. Currently, a circular short scan is used for data acquisition, which inevitably yields CB artifacts and a short coverage in the direction of the patient table. To overcome these two limitations, a more sophisticated data acquisition geometry is needed. This geometry should be complete in terms of Tuy's condition and should allow continuous scanning, while being compatible with the mechanical constraints of mounted C-arm systems. Additionally, the geometry should allow accurate image reconstruction from truncated data. One way to ensure such a feature is to adopt a trajectory that provides full R-line coverage within the field-of-view (FOV). An R-line is any segment of line that connects two points on a source trajectory, and the R-line coverage is the set of points that belong to an R-line. In this work, we propose a novel geometry called the extended ellipse-line-ellipse (ELE) for long-object imaging with a mounted C-arm system. This trajectory is built from modules consisting of two elliptical arcs connected by a line. We demonstrate that the extended ELE can be configured in many ways so that full R-line coverage is guaranteed. Both tight and relaxed parametric settings are presented. All results are supported by extensive mathematical proofs provided in appendices. Our findings make the extended ELE trajectory attractive for axially-extended FOV imaging in interventional radiology.", "The cloud computing environment is an enhancement to the predecessor grid environment, whereby multiple grids and other computation resources may be further abstracted by a cloud layer, thus making disparate devices appear to an end-consumer as a single pool of seamless resources. These resources may include such things as physical or logical computing engines, servers and devices, device memory, and storage devices.\nEnergy consumption is becoming a growing concern for enterprise storage clouds. Specifically, as workloads are added to a storage cloud, the corresponding power/energy consumption goes up, which can drive up operational costs. Different workloads have different characteristics that may be defined in terms of Input/Output (I/O) per second, cache hit rate, read-write ratio, random-sequential ratio, etc. In addition to the type and configuration of underlying storage resources, these workload parameters also influence the amount of energy consumed by the corresponding workloads. Ad-hoc allocation of storage resources may result in inefficient resource utilization as well as higher energy consumption.", "It\u2019s another week and the roommates at Sketchy Sex are again drunk, stoned and horny and looking for cock to fill their holes. The routine is the same as always when these roommates get horny. They drink some booze, smoke some weed and start posting ads on gay dating sites looking for anonymous cocks to come fill their holes.

To review and provide an overview of e-learning modules on suicide prevention designed for gatekeepers and assess their effectiveness. Two strategies were used. First, articles were systematically searched in databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO. Second, Google search was used to find e-learning modules on the Web. The literature search resulted in 448 papers, of which none met the inclusion criteria of this study. The Google search resulted in 130 hits, of which 23 met the inclusion criteria of this review. Organizations that owned the modules were contacted, of which 13 responded and nine were included in this study. The effectiveness of two e-learning modules is currently being tested in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), one organization is planning to test the effectiveness of their module, and one organization has compared their face-to-face training with their online training. Furthermore, the included modules have different characteristics. There is a need for RCTs to study the effectiveness of online modules in this area and to understand which characteristics are essential to create effective e-learning modules to educate gatekeepers in suicide prevention.", "Probenecid protects against transient focal cerebral ischemic injury by inhibiting HMGB1 release and attenuating AQP4 expression in mice.\nStroke results in inflammation, brain edema, and neuronal death. However, effective neuroprotectants are not available. Recent studies have shown that high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), a proinflammatory cytokine, contributes to ischemic brain injury. Aquaporin 4 (AQP4), a water channel protein, is considered to play a pivotal role in ischemia-induced brain edema. More recently, studies have shown that pannexin 1 channels are involved in cerebral ischemic injury and the cellular inflammatory response. Here, we examined whether the pannexin 1 channel inhibitor probenecid could reduce focal ischemic brain injury by inhibiting cerebral inflammation and edema. Transient focal ischemia was induced in C57BL/6J mice by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1 h. Infarct volume, neurological score and cerebral water content were evaluated 48 h after MCAO. Immunostaining, western blot analysis and ELISA were used to assess the effects of probenecid on the cellular inflammatory response, HMGB1 release and AQP4 expression. Administration of probenecid reduced infarct size, decreased cerebral water content, inhibited neuronal death, and reduced inflammation in the brain 48 h after stroke. In addition, HMGB1 release from neurons was significantly diminished and serum HMGB1 levels were substantially reduced following probenecid treatment. Moreover, AQP4 protein expression was downregulated in the cortical penumbra following post-stroke treatment with probenecid. These results suggest that probenecid, a powerful pannexin 1 channel inhibitor, protects against ischemic brain injury by inhibiting cerebral inflammation and edema.", "Analysis of arsenic and some other elements in coal fly ash by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.\nSurface characterization of coal fly ash (CFA) was carried out by use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), especially focusing on the occurrence of As. A peak in the XPS spectrum of CFA was assigned to oxide forms of As(3d). The molar ratios of Al, As, Ca, Fe, and S normalized to Si were obtained from XPS analysis (MR-X). Also, the molar ratios of those elements were calculated from bulk analysis (total element concentration in CFA) (MR-B). The MR-X/MR-B ratio of As was much higher than those of other elements, suggesting that As is highly enriched on the surface of CFA. When eight CFA samples were analyzed, there was an approximate relationship between the MR-X values and MR-B values for As. The leaching of elements from CFA was examined by XPS analysis and by bulk analysis. The leaching tests using EDTA and HNO3 resulted in a great decrease in the As(3d) peak area; the %leaching of As obtained by XPS analysis was almost equal to that by bulk analysis.", "\"Cell paralysis\" as an intermediate stage in the programmed cell death of epiphyseal chondrocytes during development.\nThe efficient elimination of apoptotic cells depends on heterophagocytosis by other cells, which is difficult or impossible when the dying cells are embedded in an extracellular matrix. This situation is exemplified by the epiphyseal chondrocytes during the development of the chondroepiphyses of long bones. A detailed ultrastructural study identified an unusual type of epiphyseal chondrocyte which contained a very dark nucleus with irregular patches of condensed chromatin and a crenated nuclear membrane. The cytosol consisted of excessively expanded endoplasmic reticulum lumen, containing \"islands\" of cytoplasm and organelles. Since these cells appeared to be \"in limbo,\" neither viable nor dead, they are referred to as \"paralyzed\" cells. By studying cells of intermediate morphologies, we were able to demonstrate the sequence of events leading to cell paralysis. It is proposed that the paralysis represents an intermediate state in the physiological cell death of epiphyseal chondrocytes in which destruction is orderly and avoids a inflammatory, potentially locally destructive, reaction. The cell is rendered paralyzed in terms of function but impotent in respect of damaging consequences. Paralysis is compared and contrasted with apoptosis, autophagocytosis, and necrosis and may represent another mode of programmed cell death in situations where cells are immature and/or where phagocytosis by neighboring cells is difficult.", "The cost effectiveness of strategies for the treatment of intestinal parasites in immigrants.\nCurrently, more than 600,000 immigrants enter the United States each year from countries where intestinal parasites are endemic. At entry persons with parasitic infections may be asymptomatic, and stool examinations are not a sensitive method of screening for parasitosis. Albendazole is a new, broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug, which was approved recently by the Food and Drug Administration. International trials have shown albendazole to be safe and effective in eradicating many parasites. In the United States there is now disagreement about whether to screen all immigrants for parasites, treat all immigrants presumptively, or do nothing unless they have symptoms. We compared the costs and benefits of no preventive intervention (watchful waiting) with those of universal screening or presumptive treatment with 400 mg of albendazole per day for five days. Those at risk were defined as immigrants to the United States from Asia, the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Cost effectiveness was expressed both in terms of the cost of treatment per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted (one DALY is defined as the loss of one year of healthy life to disease) and in terms of the cost per hospitalization averted. As compared with watchful waiting, presumptive treatment of all immigrants at risk for parasitosis would avert at least 870 DALYs, prevent at least 33 deaths and 374 hospitalizations, and save at least $4.2 million per year. As compared with watchful waiting, screening would cost $159,236 per DALY averted. Presumptive administration of albendazole to all immigrants at risk for parasitosis would save lives and money. Universal screening, with treatment of persons with positive stool examinations, would save lives but is less cost effective than presumptive treatment.", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling is important for smooth muscle cell replication after arterial injury.\nThe phosphoinositide 3-kinase [PI(3)K] pathway is a key signaling pathway important for replication of mammalian cells. In this study, we examined the role of PI(3)K in smooth muscle cell (SMC) replication after balloon catheter injury of rat carotid arteries. Protein kinase B (PKB), a downstream target of PI(3)K, was phosphorylated at 30 and 60 minutes after injury and to a lesser degree after 6 hours and 1 and 2 days but not after 7 days. Wortmannin (10 microgram per rat), a PI(3)K inhibitor, given to rats 60 and 5 minutes before and 11 hours after balloon injury, reduced the levels of phosphorylated PKB. SMC replication quantified between 24 to 48 hours was significantly reduced compared with control replication, as were the levels of cyclin D(1). Wortmannin was also administered to rats between days 7 and 8 and between days 7 and 9 after balloon catheter injury. A reduction in levels of phosphorylated PKB was detected, but no decrease in the replication of intimal SMCs was observed in either experiment. These data demonstrate that the PI(3)K signal transduction pathway plays an important role in medial but not intimal SMC replication.", "Differential diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma in situ using skin histopathological images.\nDifferential diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma in situ is of great importance for prognosis and decision making in the disease treatment procedure. Currently, differential diagnosis is done by pathologists based on examination of the histopathological slides under the microscope, which is time consuming and prone to inter and intra observer variability. In this paper, we have proposed an automated method for differential diagnosis of SCC in situ from actinic keratosis, which is known to be a precursor of squamous cell carcinoma. The process begins with epidermis segmentation and cornified layer removal. Then, epidermis axis is specified using the paths in its skeleton and the granular layer is removed via connected components analysis. Finally, diagnosis is done based on the classification result of intensity profiles extracted from lines perpendicular to the epidermis axis. The results of the study are in agreement with the gold standards provided by expert pathologists.", "Many vehicles are used over a wide range of vehicle speeds, including both forward and reverse movement. Internal combustion engines, however, are capable of operating efficiently only within a narrow range of speeds. Consequently, transmissions capable of efficiently transmitting power at a variety of speed ratios are frequently employed. When the vehicle is at low speed, the transmission is usually operated at a high speed ratio such that it multiplies the engine torque for improved acceleration. At high vehicle speed, operating the transmission at a low speed ratio permits an engine speed associated with quiet, fuel efficient cruising.\nHybrid vehicle transmissions improve fuel economy by providing energy storage. In a hybrid electric vehicle, for example, energy may be stored in a battery. The battery may be charged by operating the engine to produce more power than instantaneously required for propulsion. Additionally, energy that would otherwise be dissipated during braking can be captured and stored in the battery. The stored energy may be used later, allowing the engine to produce less power than instantaneously required for propulsion and thereby consuming less fuel.", "Lefty inhibits glioma growth by suppressing Nodal-activated Smad and ERK1/2 pathways.\nAs a common malignant tumor, glioma has long been a refractory disease in the field of neurosurgery. Exploration of its etiology, pathogenesis, biological characteristics, and new treatment measures is a hot topic as well as a problem most difficult to solve in the neurosurgical division. In recent years, the role of Nodal and its feedback inhibitor Lefty in tumors has drawn more and more attention and may form a new target for cancer therapy. Western blot detection indicated that there was almost no expression of Lefty protein in glioma cells. Transfection of Lefty-overexpressing vector into GBM8401 and GBM glioma cells significantly decreased the expression of Nodal. Nodal can significantly increase the phosphorylation levels of Smad2 and Smad3 and activate the ERK1/2 pathway; meanwhile, Nodal promotes the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells and inhibits their apoptosis. However, when cells were co-transfected with both Lefty- and Nodal-overexpressing vectors, Lefty inhibited the above effects of Nodal in glioma cells, hence significantly reduced the levels of phosphorylated Smad2, Smad3, and ERK1/2, inhibited the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells, and increased their apoptosis. These results indicate that in glioma cells, Lefty inhibits Nodal-mediated activation of Smad and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, thereby suppressing the promoting effect of Nodal on tumor growth.", "Consensus and difference among hospital professionals in evaluating child maltreatment.\nThe decision-making process in suspected cases of child maltreatment involves reaching interprofessional consensus. Interprofessional consensus in seriousness ratings of maltreatment incidents for the welfare of the child was examined by surveying 39 case vignette ratings by 295 pediatric hospital professionals from five occupations. The survey instrument was derived from research by Giovannoni and Becerrra (1979). An exploratory factor analysis yielded five categories of maltreatment: physical abuse, sexual abuse, general failures in care, minor neglect/discipline, and lifestyles/values. A sixth category, parental sexual preference, was rated not very serious and did not appear to belong in the maltreatment domain. Nurses and social workers rated incidents as most serious, differing significantly from psychiatrists and, often, from physicians and psychologists. Professions agreed on rank ordering of categories by seriousness. Variables such as sex, parenthood status, years of experience, and medical specialty showed some relationship to ratings within some professional groups.", "System approach for evaluating the potential yield and plantation of Jatropha curcas L. on a global scale.\nMany Jatropha curcas Linnaeus (JCL) plantations have been established in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. To assess the potential of JCL for biofuel production, the potential areas for JCL plantations, and the yields of JCL must be estimated as accurately as possible. Here, we present a system approach to estimate JCL yields, classify yield levels, and estimate productivity of future JCL plantations. We used a process-based net primary productivity (NPP) model to estimate potential JCL yields. The model estimated that the potential yield of JCL dry seed will vary from 0 to 7.62 ton ha(-1) y(-1), in contrast to estimates of 1.50-7.80 ton ha(-1) y(-1) from previous assessments. We formulated a zoning scheme that takes into account land cover status and potential yield levels. This scheme was used to evaluate the potential area and production of future plantations at the global, regional, and national levels. The estimated potential area of JCL plantations is 59-1486 million hectares worldwide, and the potential production is 56-3613 million ton dry seed y(-1). This study provides scientific information on global patterns of potential plantation areas and yields, which can be used to support bioenergy policy makers to plan commercial-scale JCL plantations.", "Low-flow appliances and household water demand: an evaluation of demand-side management policy in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\nResidential rebate programs for low-flow water devices have become increasingly popular as a means of reducing urban water demand. Although program specifics vary, low-flow rebates are available in most U.S. metropolitan areas, as well as in many smaller municipalities. Despite their popularity, few statistical analyses have been conducted regarding the effects of low-flow rebates on household water use. In this paper, we consider the effects of rebates from the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority (ABCWUA). Using panel regression techniques with a database of rebate recipients, we estimate the marginal effects of various low-flow devices on household water demand. Results indicate a negative correlation between household water use and the presence of most low-flow devices, after controlling for water price and weather conditions. Low-flow toilets have the greatest impact on water use, while low-flow washing machines, dishwashers, showerheads, and xeriscape have smaller but significant effects. In contrast, air conditioning systems, hot water recirculators, and rain barrels have no significant impact on water use. We also test for possible rebound effects (i.e. whether low-flow appliances become less-effective over time due to poor rates of retention or behavioral changes) and compare the cost effectiveness of each rebate using levelised-costs. We find no evidence of rebound effects and substantial variation in levelised-costs, with low-flow showerheads being the most cost-effective device under the current ABCWUA rebate program. The latter result suggests that water providers can improve the efficiency of rebate programs by targeting the most cost-effective devices.", "Indirect sympathomimetic agents and cerebral blood flow and metabolism.\nThe effects upon cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen consumption (CMRO2) of the infusion into the internal carotid artery of tyramine and amphetamine were investigated in 24 anaesthetized baboons. The infusion of tyramine was without effect upon CBF and CMRO2 at normocapnia, even at concentrations which significantly raised arterial blood pressure. However, marked reductions in cerebral blood flow were noted at hypercapnia during the infusion of tyramine (2.5 X 10(-7) moles/kg/min). The infusion of amphetamine (7.5 X 10(-10) moles/kg/min) resulted in significant increases in CBF (32%) and CMRO2 (37%). However, an increased concentration of amphetamine (2.5 X 10(-7) moles/kg/min) significantly reduced CBF (22%) and CMRO2 (20%). It is suggested that amphetamine, by virtue of being able to cross the blood--brain barrier and interact with the cerebral monoamine systems, is able to influence cerebral blood flow by inducing changes in cerebral metabolism, and that the minimal reactivity of the cerebral circulation to the infusion of tyramine is the result of the inability of tyramine to cross the blood--brain barrier.", "Extracting Alcohol and Substance Abuse Status from Clinical Notes: The Added Value of Nursing Data.\nWe applied an open source natural language processing (NLP) system \"NimbleMiner\" to identify clinical notes with mentions of alcohol and substance abuse. NimbleMiner allows users to rapidly discover clinical vocabularies (using word embedding model) and then implement machine learning for text classification. We used a large inpatient dataset with over 50,000 intensive care unit admissions (MIMIC II). Clinical notes included physician-written discharge summaries (n = 51,201) and nursing notes (n = 412,343). We first used physician-written discharge summaries to train the system's algorithm and then added nursing notes to the physician-written discharge summaries and evaluated algorithms prediction accuracy. Adding nursing notes to the physician-written discharge summaries resulted in almost two-fold vocabulary expansion. NimbleMiner slightly outperformed other state-of-the-art NLP systems (average F-score = .84), while requiring significantly less time for the algorithms development.: Our findings underline the importance of nursing data for the analysis of electronic patient records.", "A semiparametric test to detect associations between quantitative traits and candidate genes in structured populations.\nAlthough population-based association mapping may be subject to the bias caused by population stratification, alternative methods that are robust to population stratification such as family-based linkage analysis have lower mapping resolution. Recently, various statistical methods robust to population stratification were proposed for association studies, using unrelated individuals to identify associations between candidate genes and traits of interest. The association between a candidate gene and a quantitative trait is often evaluated via a regression model with inferred population structure variables as covariates, where the residual distribution is customarily assumed to be from a symmetric and unimodal parametric family, such as a Gaussian, although this may be inappropriate for the analysis of many real-life datasets. In this article, we proposed a new structured association (SA) test. Our method corrects for continuous population stratification by first deriving population structure and kinship matrices through a set of random genetic markers and then modeling the relationship between trait values, genotypic scores at a candidate marker and genetic background variables through a semiparametric model, where the error distribution is modeled as a mixture of Polya trees centered around a normal family of distributions. We compared our model to the existing SA tests in terms of model fit, type I error rate, power, precision and accuracy by application to a real dataset as well as simulated datasets.", "Envenoming by Bothrops jararaca in Brazil: association between venom antigenaemia and severity at admission to hospital.\nThe association between the clinical severity of Bothrops jararaca envenoming at admission and serum venom and plasma fibrinogen concentrations before antivenom administration is reported in 137 patients admitted to Hospital Vital Brazil, Instituto Butantan, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, between 1989 and 1990. Other variables such as age, gender, site of the bite, use of tourniquet and the time interval between the bite and start of antivenom therapy, spontaneous systemic bleeding, and the 20 minute whole blood clotting test (20WBCT) at admission showed no association with either severity or serum venom antigen concentration (SVAC). Mean SVAC in patients with mild envenoming was significantly lower than in the group with moderate envenoming (P = 0.0007). Patients with plasma fibrinogen concentrations > 1.5 g/L had a lower mean SVAC than patients with plasma fibrinogen concentrations < or = 1.5 g/L (P = 0.02). Those admitted with a tourniquet in place had significantly higher plasma fibrinogen concentrations than those without a tourniquet (P = 0.002). A multiple logistic regression model showed independent risk factors for severity: bites at sites other than legs or forearms, SVACs > or = 400 ng/mL, and the use of a tourniquet. Rapid quantification of SVAC before antivenom therapy might improve initial evaluation of severity in B. jararaca bites.", "An international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of intramuscular alefacept in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis.\nAlefacept, human lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3/immunoglobulin 1 fusion protein, binds to CD2 molecules on the surface of activated T cells, selectively targeting memory-effector (CD45RO+) T cells, which comprise more than 75% of T cells in psoriatic plaques. To examine the efficacy and tolerability of intramuscular alefacept. International, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. A total of 507 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. Placebo, 10 mg of alefacept, or 15 mg of alefacept administered once weekly for 12 weeks followed by 12 weeks of observation. Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI). Alefacept treatment was associated with dose-related significant improvements in PASI from baseline. Throughout the study, a greater percentage of patients in the 15-mg group than in the placebo group achieved a significant reduction in PASI. Of patients in the 15-mg group who achieved at least 75% PASI reduction 2 weeks after the last dose, 71% maintained at least 50% improvement in PASI throughout the 12-week follow-up. There were no opportunistic infections and no cases of disease rebound. Intramuscular administration of alefacept was a well-tolerated and effective therapy for chronic plaque psoriasis and thus represents a convenient alternative to intravenous dosing.", "Twenty-five years of critical care nursing scholarship in Australia.\nAustralian Critical Care has been published since 1988 and has been an important medium for the development of critical care nursing scholarship in Australia over 25 years. To review scholarship in critical care nursing in Australia since 1988 and record its progress in the context of developments in nursing education and intensive and critical care practice. Australian Critical Care issues since 1988 were reviewed, and abstracts from the Australian and New Zealand Annual Scientific Meeting on Intensive Care published in Australian Critical Care since the 1991 Meeting. Available evidence for the contribution of this body of scholarship to critical care nursing practice and patient care was considered. Original research reports and review articles have steadily increased from 1988 to 2012. The peak years for research publications were 2001, 2005 and 2012, and for reviews 2010 and 2011. Approximately 760 abstracts were presented at the Annual Scientific Meeting from 1991 to 2010; overall 24% were found lead to peer-reviewed publications, with an increase to 30% in recent years. Over 25 years, the scholarship of critical care nursing in Australia has evolved into an established area of disciplinary knowledge, based firmly in practice. Our discipline has witnessed the opportunity for PhD training, the introduction of professorial positions, a knowledge base built on original research and rigorous reviews, and sustainable dissemination. The challenges are to further strengthen this development, increase publication of research that is done, to demonstrate the influence on practice and to develop sustainable research funding.", "This invention relates to a method of and an apparatus for composing an approximate sinusoidal waveform by utilizing a squaring operation and a coordinate conversion process.\nIt is generally well known that any type of waveform can be obtained by such a method wherein the digital words indicative of a waveform are memorized in a memory device such as a read only memory (ROM) and read out by accessing its addresses by an input variable. This method is called a table look-up method since it is similar to a method of reading a function table. However, it has such disadvantages that a large number of read only memories are required to reduce quantization noise and therefore its reading speed is comparatively low. For example, if the number of address bits is increased by one to reduce the quantization noise to one half, then the table scale or data to be memorized is doubled compared with the original, thus resulting in enlargement of the hardware. When the data and the addresses are both expressed by twelve bits, the memory capacity should be as large as approximately 48 K bits (K = 1024). In general, to avoid such increase of memory capacity, the so called interpolation process may be utilized. In this process, the data for the points between respective adajacent addresses are calculated through an interpolation operation. But to perform such an interpolation process, multiplication circuits and other circuits associated therewith will necessarily be required, and therefore simplification of the hardware is almost impossible when considering the total hardware so long as the interpolation process is employed.", "Personality and non-suicidal deliberate self-harm: Trait differences among a non-clinical population.\nLimited information is available on understanding why particular individuals engage in non-suicidal deliberate self-harm (DSH), especially among non-clinical populations. An array of personality traits, such as those included in the five-factor model of personality, may further an understanding of DSH. The purpose of this study was to examine personality traits among non-clinical groups with or without a history of DSH. College students (N=238) completed self-report measures of DSH and personality. Both multivariate (MANOVA, discriminant analysis) and univariate (ANOVA) statistical procedures supported the hypothesis that those with a history of DSH (n=59) had significantly higher levels of neuroticism and openness to experience, and significantly lower levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness. Contrary to expectations, there were no differences in extraversion between the two groups. These results indicate personality differences among those with a history of DSH, which with additional research, may prove to be risk factors or targets of intervention for future DSH or collateral problems.", "Mortality from cancer and other causes in commercial airline crews: a joint analysis of cohorts from 10 countries.\nCommercial airline crew is one of the occupational groups with the highest exposures to ionising radiation. Crew members are also exposed to other physical risk factors and subject to potential disruption of circadian rhythms. This study analyses mortality in a pooled cohort of 93 771 crew members from 10 countries. The cohort was followed for a mean of 21.7 years (2.0 million person-years), during which 5508 deaths occurred. The overall mortality was strongly reduced in male cockpit (SMR 0.56) and female cabin crews (SMR 0.73). The mortality from radiation-related cancers was also reduced in male cockpit crew (SMR 0.73), but not in female or male cabin crews (SMR 1.01 and 1.00, respectively). The mortality from female breast cancer (SMR 1.06), leukaemia and brain cancer was similar to that of the general population. The mortality from malignant melanoma was elevated, and significantly so in male cockpit crew (SMR 1.57). The mortality from cardiovascular diseases was strongly reduced (SMR 0.46). On the other hand, the mortality from aircraft accidents was exceedingly high (SMR 33.9), as was that from AIDS in male cabin crew (SMR 14.0). This large study with highly complete follow-up shows a reduced overall mortality in male cockpit and female cabin crews, an increased mortality of aircraft accidents and an increased mortality in malignant skin melanoma in cockpit crew. Further analysis after longer follow-up is recommended.", "Effects of an antitumoural rhodium complex on thioacetamide-induced liver tumor in rats. Changes in the activities of ornithine decarboxylase, tyrosine aminotransferase and of enzymes involved in fatty acid and glycerolipid synthesis.\nRats were injected daily for 8 weeks with 50 mg of thioacetamide per kg to produce liver tumours. Some of these rats were given three doses of 50 mg of an antitumoural Rh(III) complex/kg at 14, 9 and 5 days before the end of the thioacetamide treatment. Thioacetamide decreased the rate of weight gain of the rats and the Rh(III) complex partly restored it. The activities of ATP citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase in the livers were decreased by thioacetamide treatment and the Rh(III) complex partly reversed this effect. By contrast the activity of malic enzyme was increased by both thioacetamide and the Rh(III) complex and this effect probably relates to NADPH production for detoxification rather than for lipogenesis. Treatment with thioacetamide increased the rate of synthesis of di- and triacylglycerols from glycerol phosphate by liver homogenates, the activity of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase and the incorporation of [3H]glycerol into liver triacylglycerol in vivo. The Rh(III) complex did not produce a significant reversal of these effects of thioacetamide on glycerolipid synthesis. The total uptake of intraportally injected [3H]glycerol by the livers of thioacetamide treated rats was decreased and this was associated with a lowered activity of glycerol kinase. Thioacetamide increased the activity of hepatic ornithine decarboxylase by about 40-fold, but the Rh(III) complex did not reverse this effect. However, the decrease in tyrosine aminotransferase activity that was produced by thioacetamide was partly reversed by the Rh(III) complex. These results are discussed in relation to the tumour-promoting effects of thioacetamide and the antitumoural action of the Rh(III) complex.", "Safety and efficacy of the use of large bore intermediate suction catheters alone or in combination for the treatment of acute cerebral venous sinus thrombosis: A multicenter experience.\nSystemic anticoagulation is the standard treatment for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). Several endovascular techniques have been described as salvage therapy for anticoagulation refractory CVST cases. We aim to evaluate the safety and feasibility of endovascular aspiration thrombectomy using the new generation, large bore suction catheters alone or in combination with stentriever devices for the treatment of CVST. We collected data on 16 consecutive patients with CVST who received endovascular aspiration thrombectomy at three large academic centers. Second generation reperfusion catheters were used as a large bore suction catheter and advanced to the affected sinus using a coaxial technique. Suction was performed using pump suction. At times, a stentriever was used as an anchor to facilitate advancing the suction catheter and to increase thrombectomy capabilities. Median decade of age was the 50s and nine patients were women. Fifty percent of the patients had multiple sinuses involved. All patients received systemic anticoagulation prior to endovascular aspiration thrombectomy. The most common reason to pursue endovascular aspiration thrombectomy in CVST patients was deterioration of initial clinical status (10/16). The mean time from admission to endovascular aspiration thrombectomy was 1.5 days (range 0-6 days). Good recanalization was obtained in all patients. There were no major peri-procedural complications. Most patients were discharged to either home or a rehabilitation facility. Endovascular aspiration treatment using large bore suction catheters for CVST is a safe and feasible approach for the treatment of anticoagulation refractory CVST. Heterogeneity of the clinical and radiological presentation requires further investigation to optimize patient selection before evaluating the efficacy of this technique in larger prospective studies.", "High-throughput and real-time study of single cell electroporation using microfluidics: effects of medium osmolarity.\nElectroporation has been widely accepted as an important tool for the delivery of exogenous molecules into cells. Previous mechanistic studies have been carried out by observing either the average behavior from a large population of cells or the response from a small number of single cells. In this study, we demonstrated a novel microfluidic method with high throughput (up to 30 Hz) for real-time studies of single cell electroporation events. Electroporation occurred when cells flowed through a section of a microfluidic channel defined by special geometry. A CCD camera was used to monitor the response of cells starting from the onset of the electroporation. We studied the swelling of Chinese hamster ovary cells and the rupture of cell membrane during electroporation using this technique. We applied buffers with different osmolarities to investigate the effects of medium osmolarity, based on results from a population of single cells. We were able to establish the distributions of the rates of swelling and membrane rupture in the cell population. We also explored establishing the correlation between the property (the cell diameter) and the behavior (the swelling rate) of single cells. Our results indicated that the processes of swelling and rupture occurred more rapidly in the hypotonic or hypertonic buffers than in the isotonic buffer. Statistical analysis did not reveal strong linear correlation between the cell size and the swelling rate. These proof-of-concept studies reveal the potential of applying microfluidics to study electroporation of a cell population at single cell level in real time with high throughput. The limitations associated with this approach were also addressed.", "Histopathological features of murine systemic vasculitis caused by Candida albicans extract--an animal model of Kawasaki disease.\nWe examined the histopathological features of systemic vasculitis caused in mice by injection of a Candida albicans ( C. albicans) extract and investigated the principal genetic roles in the development of vasculitis. C. albicans extract was injected intraperitoneally for five consecutive days in the 1st and 5th weeks to CD-1, C57BL/6N, C3H/HeN, BALB/cAnN, DBA/2N and CBA/JN mice. At week 8, mice were killed, and histological examination was performed by light microscopy. Arteritis had developed in 66% of CD-1 mice. The extramural coronary arteries and aortic root close to the orifice of coronary arteries were most frequently involved. Histologically, the characteristic feature of the arteritis was proliferative and granulomatous inflammation accompanied by numerous macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and neutrophils. Fibrocellular intimal thickening with destruction of the internal elastic lamina and media was also observed. Five mouse strains after injection of C. albicans extract were clearly classified into a resistant group (CBA/JN, DBA/2N and BALB/cAnN mice) and a sensitive group (C3H/HeN and C57BL/6N mice). The inbred mouse strains which showed the same histocompatibility-2 (H-2) haplotype exhibited a different susceptibility to development of vasculitis. This arteritis murine model shows unique histological features that have not been observed in other animal vasculitis models and it most closely resembles Kawasaki disease in humans. The genetic control of susceptibility to induction of vasculitis by the C. albicans extract is dependent to the mouse strains, but is not linked to the H-2 loci.", "Tiazofurin: a new antitumor agent.\nTiazofurin is an interesting drug now entering Phase I trials, with marked preclinical antitumor activity against P388 and L1210 leukemias, and the Lewis lung carcinoma. Schedule dependency favoring frequent administration has been noted. The drug has a novel mechanism of action, being metabolized to an inhibitory cofactor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. Tiazofurin is widely distributed after i.v. administration exhibiting a triphasic pattern of plasma decay, with a terminal half-life of 3-16 h in the three species studied. Approximately 90% of the drug was excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 h. A significant potential for the slower release of intracellularly retained drug exists. Anticipated organ toxicities based on the studies described include myelotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. These were mild and reversible at lower doses, and were not seen at levels corresponding to the starting doses in man. A potential for hyperuricemia exists; this should be easily controllable by the use of allopurinol, without compromising the drug's antitumor effect. Phase I trials under the sponsorship of the NCI are underway in a number of institutions.", "Toll-like receptor 2 expression on human conjunctival epithelial cells: a pathway for Staphylococcus aureus involvement in chronic ocular proinflammatory responses.\nStaphylococcus aureus colonization is common in atopic keratoconjunctivitis, potentially activating epithelial cells via toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) and the receptor for platelet-activating factor (PAFR). To examine human conjunctival epithelial cells for the expression of TLR-2 in vitro and in vivo and to evaluate the role of TLR-2 in S aureus-mediated activation of these cells. Conjunctival epithelial cells isolated from cadaveric tissues were stimulated with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) or a commercial S aureus cell wall extract (Staphylococcus aureus-CWE) (with or without anti-TLR-2 blocking antibody or PAFR antagonist) and were analyzed for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 8 (IL-8) release; surface expression of TLR-2, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, HLA, and CD14; and TLR-2 messenger RNA expression. Ocular surface cells collected via impression cytology were examined for TLR-2 expression via flow cytometry. Expression of TLR-2 was up-regulated on conjunctival epithelial cells by IFN-gamma and Staphylococcus aureus-CWE. Expression of TLR-2 messenger RNA was increased by IFN-gamma. Staphylococcus aureus-CWE up-regulated intercellular adhesion molecule 1, HLA, and CD14 expression and increased TNF-alpha and IL-8 release in a dose-dependent manner. Anti-TLR-2 significantly inhibited TNF-alpha release, whereas PAFR antagonist significantly inhibited IL-8 release. Toll-like receptor 2 was expressed on conjunctival epithelial cells from 4 of 5 patients with atopic keratoconjunctivitis, 3 of 5 with seasonal allergies, and 0 of 3 without allergies. Conjunctival epithelial cells express TLR-2 and may play an active role in the chronic ocular inflammatory response to S aureus through pathways that involve TLR-2 and PAFR.", "Cerebral aneurysms: conventional microsurgical technique and endovascular method.\nRecent advances in neurosurgery and interventional neuroradiology have brought us a new aspect in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. The present series provides a balanced overview of the treatment of aneurysms in surgical clipping and coil embolization. Between January 2004 and March 2006, a total of 119 consecutive patients with cerebral aneurysms underwent endovascular embolization or surgical clipping. Of these, 79 patients suffered an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), whereas the remaining 40 patients had nonruptured cerebral aneurysms. Of the 32 surgically treated patients, 25 (78.1%) achieved a favorable outcome. Of the 47 patients who underwent endovascular embolization, 38 (80.9%) achieved a favorable outcome. No significant difference was observed regarding the proportion of favorable outcomes between the two treatment modalities. Four patients (5.5%) who underwent endovascular embolization required re-treatments but no re-treatments were needed in the surgically treated patients. Of the 40 cases with nonruptured aneurysms, 12 (30%) were treated using surgical clipping, whereas 28 (70%) underwent endovascular embolization. The complication rates of the two treatment modalities demonstrated no significant difference. A combined microsurgical-endovascular team approach is thus considered to provide the most effective means to achieve favorable outcomes for patients with cerebral aneurysms. A case-by-case evaluation based on the individual characteristics of each aneurysm is therefore considered to be essential.", "Quantitative mapping of averaged focal adhesion dynamics in migrating cells by shape normalization.\nThe spatially ordered formation and disassembly of focal adhesions is a basic requirement for effective cell locomotion. Because focal adhesions couple the contractile actin-myosin network to the substrate, their distribution determines the pattern of traction forces propelling the cell in a certain direction. In the present study, we quantitatively analyzed the spatial patterning of cell-substrate adhesion in migrating cells by mapping averaged focal adhesion growth dynamics to a standardized cell coordinate system. These maps revealed distinct zones of focal adhesion assembly, disassembly and stability and were strongly interrelated with corresponding actin flow and traction force patterns. Moreover, the mapping technique enables precise detection of even minute responses of adhesion dynamics upon targeted signaling perturbations. For example, the partial inhibition of vinculin phosphorylation was followed by the reduced number of newly formed adhesions, whereas growth dynamics of existing adhesions remained unaffected.", "Effects of tartar-control dentifrice on tooth sensitivity: a pilot study.\nThe purpose of this three-week, double-blind pilot study was to assess the effects of a tartar-control dentifrice on tooth sensitivity. Fifty-six volunteer dental hygiene students completed a 14-item questionnaire regarding their oral health. Eighteen students were excluded from the study due to prior tooth sensitivity. Thirty-eight students were randomly assigned to either the experimental group using a tartar-control dentifrice (containing tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, PEG-6, disodium pyrophosphate, and tetrasodium pyrosulphate in a 5.0% soluble pyrophosphate formulation) or the control group using a regular dentifrice. Participants brushed for three weeks twice daily and then completed a post-treatment questionnaire, which included questions about tooth sensitivity. Differences between groups in reported sensitivity were measured by Fisher's Exact Test. Fisher's Exact Test revealed a statistically significant difference in sensitivity experienced by the experimental group compared to the control group (p < 0.05), which reported no sensitivity. The phi coefficient, used to examine the strength of the relationship between tartar control paste and tooth sensitivity, was found significant at p < 0.02. These findings suggest that patients may experience dentinal hypersensitivity when using the tartar-control toothpaste tested. Further long-term studies are required to test various brands of tartar-control dentifrice with a larger, more diverse sample for clinical measures of sensitivity.", "Crystalline and glassy phases in the Cs/Bi/As/S system.\nThe quaternary Cs2S/Bi/As/S system was studied in an attempt to introduce two different asymmetric but isoelectronic building units, namely, [Bi(III)(x)S(y)] and [As(III)(x)S(y)], in a single structure. Reactions with a comparatively lower equivalent of arsenic in the Cs2S/Bi/As/S mixture led to the crystalline compound Cs3Bi(AsS4)2. The structure features tetrahedral [As(V)S4](3-) connected to Bi(III) centers to give infinite (1/\u221e)[Bi(AsS4)2(3-)] chains. When the basicity was raised in these low arsenic fluxes by increasing the Cs2S fraction, the crystalline compound Cs9Bi(AsS4)4, also featuring [As(V)S4](3-) anions, was formed. On the other hand, arsenic-rich mixtures of Cs2S/Bi/As/S led to the formation of the glassy phase Cs2BiAs3S7, which contains As(III) species. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis indicate the presence of As(III)-containing [AsnS2n+1] fragments in the glass structure. Several glasses in the series Cs(n-1)BiAs(n)S(2n+1) were also prepared using solid-state fusion reactions. The band gaps of the Cs(n-1)BiAs(n)S(2n+1) glasses are in the range of 1.51-1.81 eV, while that of the crystalline compound Cs3Bi(AsS4)2 is ~2.33 eV. The thermal and optical behaviors of these compounds are correlated with their structures and building units.", "Prediction of the possibility of the second peak of drug plasma concentration time curve after iv bolus administration from the standpoint of the traditional multi-compartmental linear pharmacokinetics.\nIt is shown that the existence of the second peak on the drug plasma concentration time curve C(p)(t) after iv bolus dosing can be explained by considering the traditional multi-compartmental linear pharmacokinetics. It was found that a direct solution of the general three-compartment model yields the second peak of C(p)(t) for the certain values of the rate constants, and C(p)(t) includes the term with oscillating preexponent, that is, K sin(omegat + phi) exp(-lambdat), in this case. The considered model describes the drug entero-hepatic recirculation in the species which do not have gall bladder (rats). The model fit of the experimental data from rat pharmacokinetic studies where the second peak of C(p)(t) was observed, yields the rate of bile production that is consistent with the physiological value ( approximately 0.7 mL/h).", "Lexical and phonological processes in dyslexic readers: evidence from a visual lexical decision task.\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate whether reading failure in the context of an orthography of intermediate consistency is linked to inefficient use of the lexical orthographic reading procedure. The performance of typically developing and dyslexic Portuguese-speaking children was examined in a lexical decision task, where the stimulus lexicality, word frequency and length were manipulated. Both lexicality and length effects were larger in the dyslexic group than in controls, although the interaction between group and frequency disappeared when the data were transformed to control for general performance factors. Children with dyslexia were influenced in lexical decision making by the stimulus length of words and pseudowords, whereas age-matched controls were influenced by the length of pseudowords only. These findings suggest that non-impaired readers rely mainly on lexical orthographic information, but children with dyslexia preferentially use the phonological decoding procedure--albeit poorly--most likely because they struggle to process orthographic inputs as a whole such as controls do. Accordingly, dyslexic children showed significantly poorer performance than controls for all types of stimuli, including words that could be considered over-learned, such as high-frequency words. This suggests that their orthographic lexical entries are less established in the orthographic lexicon.", "Partial hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.\nThis review summarizes the efficacy of the most common therapeutic option for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), partial hepatic resection, taking into account not only its antitumoural effect, but also its consequences on survival. Partial hepatic resection results in 5 year survival rates as high as 45% in more favourable subgroups having: small tumours, well-differentiated tumours, unifocal tumours, a lack of vascular invasions, an absence of cirrhosis, and the fibrolamellar variant. Resection has been limited primarily by low resectability rates and recurrent disease. However, surgical resection in the form of partial hepatectomy is the preferred treatment for HCC. The early detection of tumours by screening high-risk populations is crucial. During the 12 year period between 1983 and 1994, hepatic resections were carried out in 382 patients with HCC. One hundred and fifty-three (40%) had HCC smaller than 5 cm in diameter. There were 294 male and 88 female patients, with an average age of 52.3 years. Among them, 45% had liver cirrhosis and 73% were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen. Two hundred and eighteen (57%) were positive for hepatitis C virus circulating antibodies (since 1991). Operative mortality was 3.9%. The overall survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 71, 52 and 46%, respectively. Sex, cirrhosis, Child's staging, surgical procedure, blood loss, pathological pattern, presence of capsule, surgical margin and DNA ploidy appeared to be factors not related to prognosis. However, alpha-fetoprotein level, size (whether less than or greater than 5 cm), and vascular invasion were factors which significantly affect survival.", "The integration of multiple independent data reveals an unusual response to Pleistocene climatic changes in the hard tick Ixodes ricinus.\nIn the last few years, improved analytical tools and the integration of genetic data with multiple sources of information have shown that temperate species exhibited more complex responses to ice ages than previously thought. In this study, we investigated how Pleistocene climatic changes affected the current distribution and genetic diversity of European populations of the tick Ixodes ricinus, an ectoparasite with high ecological plasticity. We first used mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers to investigate the phylogeographic structure of the species and its Pleistocene history using coalescent-based methods; then we used species distribution modelling to infer the climatic niche of the species at last glacial maximum; finally, we reviewed the literature on the I. ricinus hosts to identify the locations of their glacial refugia. Our results support the scenario that during the last glacial phase, I. ricinus never experienced a prolonged allopatric divergence in separate glacial refugia, but persisted with interconnected populations across Southern and Central Europe. The generalist behaviour in host choice of I. ricinus would have played a major role in maintaining connections between its populations. Although most of the hosts persisted in separate refugia, from the point of view of I. ricinus, they represented a continuity of 'bridges' among populations. Our study highlights the importance of species-specific ecology in affecting responses to Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles. Together with other cases in Europe and elsewhere, it contributes to setting new hypotheses on how species with wide ecological plasticity coped with Pleistocene climatic changes.", "Cellular ontogeny of RBMY during human spermatogenesis and its role in sperm motility.\nThe Y-chromosome-encoded gene RBMY (RNA-binding motif on Y) is a male germline RNA-binding protein and is postulated to be a RNA-splicing regulator. In order to understand the roles of RBMY in different stages of male gamete maturation, the present study aimed at determining its cellular expression during spermatogenesis, spermeogenesis and in mature spermatozoa. In the spermatogonia (cKIT-positive cells), RBMY immunolocalized as two distinct foci, one in the nucleolus and the other in the subnuclear region; in the spermatocytes (cKIT-negative cells), the nucleus had punctuate staining with a subnuclear foci; in the pachytene cells, the protein was localized as a punctuate pattern in the nucleus spread along the elongating chromosomes. In the round and the elongating spermatids, the protein expression was polarized and restricted to the cytoplasm and in the developing mid-piece. In testicular and ejaculated sperm, RBMY was localized to the mid-piece region and weakly in the tail. Incubation of spermatozoa with the RBMY antibody reduced its motility. The spatial differences in expression of RBMY in the germ cells and the presences of this protein in post-meiotic cells and in transcriptionally inert spermatozoa suggest its involvement in multiple functions beyond RNA splicing. One such possible function of RBMY could be its involvement in sperm motility.", "Myeloid differentiation factor 88 promotes cisplatin chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.\nTo investigate regulatory effects and associated mechanisms of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) on cisplatin chemoresistance in human ovarian cancer (OC) cells. The expression of MyD88 in SKOV3/DDP cells was restrained by short interfering RNA (siRNA) of MyD88. Cell viability and proliferation in the presence or absence of cisplatin were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). The expression of p-Akt protein, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) was detected by Western blot analysis. After Protein Kinase B (PKB/Akt) signal pathway was inhibited by the p-Akt inhibitor (LY294002) and the expression of MRP1 was restrained by siRNA of MRP1, CCK-8 was used to examine the cell proliferation after treatment with cisplatin. After the expression of MyD88 in SKOV3/DDP cells was restrained, the cell proliferation was inhibited, the cisplatin resistance decreased and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) reduced to 38 % of the control group (P < 0.01). The increased expression of p-Akt, XIAP, and MRP1 in SKOV3/DDP cells after cisplatin treatment was also repressed by the downregulation of MyD88. Furthermore, the inhibition of PKB/Akt signal pathway or expression of MRP1 both could decrease the cisplatin resistance of SKOV3/DDP cells and the IC50 decreased to 75 and 53 % of the control group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05), respectively. MyD88 promoted cisplatin chemoresistance in human OC cells through activating PKB/Akt signal pathway, and enhancing the expression of XIAP and MRP1. MyD88 might be a new target of the novel pharmacological treatments for cisplatin-resistant OC.", "Inherent increase of apoptosis in liver tumors: implications for carcinogenesis and tumor regression.\nWe quantitatively assessed rates of cell replication and of apoptosis during the development and regression of liver cancer. In rats, apoptotic activity gradually increased from normal liver to putative preneoplastic foci (PPF), to hepatocellular adenoma (HCA), and to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). At all stages, rates of cell replication were higher than of apoptosis, allowing a preferential net gain of (pre)neoplastic cells. As in rats, in human HCC, birth and death rates were increased manifold, indicating a species-independent phenomenon. Implications of the increasing cell turnover were studied in rats using the administration and withdrawal of nafenopin (NAF), a liver mitogen and nongenotoxic carcinogen. Prolonged NAF treatment enhanced cell number in normal liver by 25%, while PPF and liver tumors were amplified at least 100-fold. After stopping NAF treatment, cell replication ceased, while cell elimination by apoptosis was increased in normal and (pre)neoplastic liver. HCA and HCC showed the most pronounced shifts from replication toward apoptosis. As a result, 5 weeks after halting NAF, 20% of cells in normal liver, but about 85% of (pre)neoplastic lesions including HCC, were eliminated. The implications of these findings include that nongenotoxic carcinogens can act as survival factors even for malignant cells. Furthermore, tumor cells not only exhibit excessive proliferation, but also undergo apoptosis at rates that far exceed those in normal tissue. Therefore, inhibition of cell death by the survival activity of nongenotoxic carcinogens results in selective growth of (pre)neoplastic lesions. On the other hand, blockade of survival effects leads to excessive apoptosis in (pre)neoplasia and seems promising as a therapeutic concept for the selective elimination of (liver) cancer.", "Benefit of supplementary fat plus protein counting as compared with conventional carbohydrate counting for insulin bolus calculation in children with pump therapy.\nTo investigate carbohydrate (CARB) and supplementary fat/protein (CFP) counting using normal and dual-wave bolus in pump therapy of children and young people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). A randomized clinical trial was conducted in 42 patients (age 6-21 yr) with T1D for at least 1 yr (5.2 \u00b1 3.1 yr, mean \u00b1 SD) and pump therapy for at least 3 months (3.3 \u00b1 1.8 yr). Standardized test meals (pizza-salami; 50% carbohydrate, 34% fat, 16% protein; corresponding to 33% of age-adjusted daily energy requirement) were given at lunch time on four different days with normal and dual-wave bolus using CARB and CFP counting in a randomized sequence. Sensor-augmented pumps were used for continuous glucose monitoring of 6-h postprandial glucose profiles. Intra-individual comparisons of glucose parameters [area under the curve (AUC) mg/dL \u00d7 6 h; average glucose, AV mg/dL] were performed. Using CFP counting, 6-h postprandial glucose AUC (805 \u00b1 261) and AV (137.8 \u00b1 46.2) were significantly lower than AUC (926 \u00b1 285) and AV (160.5 \u00b1 51.9) by CARB counting (p < 0.001, each). CFP counting led to significantly lower postprandial glucose parameters independently from the kind of bolus (normal bolus: \u0394AUC 169, p < 0.001; \u0394AV 30.6, p < 0.001/dual-wave bolus: \u0394AUC 73, p = 0.045, \u0394AV 14.8, p = 0.033). Postprandial hypoglycemia episodes (<70 mg/dL) occurred more frequently in CFP than in CARB counting (35.7% vs. 9.5%, p < 0.001). No severe hypoglycemia was reported. In patients with long-term T1D, meal-related insulin dosing based on carbohydrate plus fat/protein counting reduces the postprandial glucose levels (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01400659).", "The apparatus herein disclosed is designed to monitor and keep constant the density of a pressurized sulfur hexafluoride gas within large outdoor circuit breakers utilized by power companies. The gas is used as an arc-suppressant upon opening of the breaker contacts for the high pressure system and as an electrical insulator to prevent any current drain to the outer walls or any other grounded parts of the circuit breaker in the low pressure system. Because the dialectic strength of the gas is a function of the density, it is desirable and required that the latter must be kept constant. Since the density is a function of pressure, temperature and volume, these parameters must be dealt with in this type of control. According to the invention there are two models involved, one for high and one for lower pressure system. In both systems micro-switches or valves are used as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,490,342.", "Adaptation and validation of DNA synthesis detection by fluorescent dye derivatization for high-throughput screening.\nCellular proliferation is fundamental to organism development, tissue renewal, and diverse disease states such as cancer. In vitro measurement of proliferation by high-throughput screening allows rapid characterization of the effects of small-molecule or genetic treatments on primary and established cell lines. Current assays that directly measure the cell cycle are not amenable to high-throughput processing and analysis. Here we report the adaptation of the chemical method for detecting DNA synthesis by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation into both high-throughput liquid handling and high-content imaging analysis. We demonstrate that chemical detection of EdU incorporation is effective for high-resolution analysis and quantitation of DNA synthesis by high-content imaging. To validate this assay platform we used treatments of MCF10A cells with media supplements and pharmacological inhibitors that are known to affect cell proliferation. Treatments with specific kinase inhibitors indicate that EGF and serum stimulation employs both the mitogen extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling networks. As described here, this method is fast, reliable, and inexpensive and yields robust data that can be easily interpreted.", "Histological evaluation of internally-fixed osteochondral lesions of the knee.\nWe evaluated the histological changes before and after fixation in ten knees of ten patients with osteochondritis dissecans who had undergone fixation of the unstable lesions. There were seven males and three females with a mean age of 15 years (11 to 22). The procedure was performed either using bio-absorbable pins only or in combination with an autologous osteochondral plug. A needle biopsy was done at the time of fixation and at the time of a second-look arthroscopy at a mean of 7.8 months (6 to 9) after surgery. The biopsy specimens at the second-look arthroscopy showed significant improvement in the histological grading score compared with the pre-fixation scores (p < 0.01). In the specimens at the second-look arthroscopy, the extracellular matrix was stained more densely than at the time of fixation, especially in the middle to deep layers of the articular cartilage. Our findings show that articular cartilage regenerates after fixation of an unstable lesion in osteochondritis dissecans.", "[Infectional and molecular-genetical properties of cryopreserved strains of adeno- and rotaviruses].\nInfluence of cryopreservation and long-term storage in conditions of moderate-low temperatures on infectious activity and molecular-genetic properties of monkey rotavirus, human family rotavirus and human adenovirus of serotype 3 has been studied. Preservation of initial antigenic structure and biological properties of the given viruses is necessary both in biotechnology for manufacture of means of specific preventive maintenance and diagnostics of human adeno- and rotavirus infection and for preservation of collection strains. The conducted researches have shown, that cryopreservation monkey rotavirus standard strain SA-11 in conditions of moderately low temperature at -20 degrees C with the subsequent storage during 18 years resulted in significant degradation of virus RNA and loss of infectious properties of the virus. Cryopreservation of human adenovirus of serotype 3 at -20 degrees C with the subsequent storage in these conditions during 12 years also leads to the loss of its infectious properties, despite high resistance of the virus described in literature to physical and chemical influences of the environment. Therefore it is expedient to perform cryopreservation and storage of even nonpurified strains of these viruses at temperatures of liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C).", "Surgery for pilonidal disease.\nSurgery for pilonidal disease carries a considerable risk of complications, recurrence, and cosmetic sequelae. The present study evaluates the four procedures performed in our institution. Operations from 1999 through 2002 were retrospectively assessed. Cosmetic result and overall satisfaction were reported on visual analogue scales. Seventy-three procedures were performed in 71 patients: excision with open granulation in nine; excision and primary suture in 25; rhomboid plasty in 23; and lay-open in 16 patients. Infections were as frequent after rhomboid plasty (40%) as after excision and primary suture (43%). Nineteen recurrences (26%) were observed during a median follow-up of 20 months, and the estimated five-year actuarial recurrence rate was 44%. Recurrence occurred in 1/9 (11%) after excision with granulation, in 4/23 (17%) after excision and suture, in 5/25 (20%) after rhomboid plasty, and in 9/16 patients (56%) after lay-open. The cosmetic result was satisfactory only in 22/53 (42%) patients; the result was poor in 16/53 (30%) patients. Results after surgery for pilonidal disease are modest and should be compared to conservative management in a randomised trial.", "Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Comparing Transfemoral, Transcarotid, and Transcaval Access.\nDespite newer-generation valves using smaller-sized sheaths, 10% to 20% of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) require nonfemoral artery access for valve delivery. To avoid a transthoracic procedure, we have used transcarotid (TC) and transcaval (TCav) approaches in these patients. This study compared the results of a contemporary experience with transfemoral (TF), TC, and TCav approaches. Between January 2015 and March 2017, 491 patients underwent TAVR at our institution, of which 463 were included in this analysis. Valve delivery was TF in 373 patients, TCav in 58, and TC in 32. Patient characteristics and outcomes, including 1-year survival, were compared. Preoperative demographics and postoperative outcomes were similar for the three groups with several exceptions. TCav patients had higher The Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score than TF patients (8.0 \u00b1 5.2 vs 6.1 \u00b1 4.3, p = 0.004). Lung disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease were more common in TC and TCav patients. Median length of stay was 2 days for TF, 3 days for TC, and 4 days for TCav (TF vs TCav, p = 0.001). Procedural mortality, percentage discharged home, and the 30-day readmission rate were similar for all. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival was also similar at 1 year (TF, 86%; TC, 83%; TCav, 80%). Patients unsuitable for TF TAVR treated with TC or TCav access had 30-day/in-hospital and 1-year survival similar to a contemporary cohort undergoing TF access. Avoiding surgical entry to the chest may offer procedural and intermediate-term outcomes equivalent to TF TAVR.", "Modeling initial attack success of wildfire suppression in Catalonia, Spain.\nIn southern European regions, the few fires that escape initial attack (IA) account for most of the burned area. Nonetheless, limited effort has been conducted to develop spatiotemporal models aiming at improving pre-positioning and deployment of fire-fighting brigades on the first dispatch. To this end, we calibrated a model to assess the probability of containment of fire by IA in Catalonia (northeastern Spain). The model was trained using machine learning algorithms from georeferenced historical fire ignition locations, fire response and weather conditions. Our results indicated that early detection, ground accessibility, and aerial support governed the broad spatial pattern of fire containment probability, with strong gradients that ranged from lowest chances of containment in northwestern mountains to highest in the coastal belt. In turn, weather conditions and fire simultaneity were crucial to explain the differences during wildfire season. We found that fires igniting above the 85th percentile of temperature and wind speed, during simultaneous fire episodes (n > 10), and 12.5 km away from the nearest fire station will probably escape IA, and grow into large events. These hazardous fire danger conditions were met 13 days per year on average during the period 1998-2015, with 5 fire simultaneous episodes escaping IA that burned 1546 ha in total. Results were provided as a set of high-resolution raster grids (100 m), which replicated the most typical weather and fire occurrence scenarios that first responders are likely to face during the wildfire season. This study reveals existing limitations in the dominant fire exclusion policy of Mediterranean areas and advocates for a comprehensive long-term wildfire management solution. Our model may help inform science-based decision-making on IA and general fire response planning in the study area.", "The present invention relates to a unique method for preparing N-substituted phenylenediamines from N-phenylquinoneimine. N-substituted phenylenediamines are useful as in the production of drugs, agricultural products, and useful as dyes, antioxidants, antiozonants, gel inhibitors and polymerization inhibitors for rubber.\nN-substituted phenylenediamines have been made by a variety of methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, Japanese Application 125343-1981 discloses a process for the preparation of phenylenediamines or its N-substitution product by reacting aminophenol or its N-substitution product with (a) ammonia, primary amine or secondary amine in the presence of an acidic catalyst and polycyclic aromatic compound. The process disclosed in Japanese Application No. 125343-1981 is characterized by a one step, one pot procedure and suggests via gas chromatography that yields are upwards to 50 percent. However, preparation of the products by this procedure would necessitate the use of elaborate distillation equipment to remove the polycyclic aromatic compounds that are employed. The removal of the polycyclic aromatic compounds further contributes to the expense of manufacturing the N-substituted phenylenediamine. Since demand for N-substituted phenyenediamines is on the increase with their wide-spread applications, there is a need for a new and more efficient process for their production.", "Correlation between histologic diagnosis mean nucleolar organizer region count and prognosis in canine mammary tumors.\nIn this study, surgically excised mammary tumors from 98 bitches were graded histologically, and the grade was compared with the mean nucleolar organizer region (NOR) count in silver-stained paraffin-embedded sections. Histologically benign tumors, papillary adenocarcinomas, and intraductal carcinomas showed relatively little variation; the mean count for each category was between three and four NOR per nucleus. There was, however, a significant increase in the NOR counts in tubular and solid carcinomas. This increase was most pronounced for tumors that showed evidence of infiltration into the surrounding connective tissues. The mean NOR count for noninfiltrative carcinomas was 5.1, and that for invasive carcinomas was 7.3 (P less than 0.03). The mean NOR count for individual carcinomas ranged from 2.0 to 12.3, and a significant correlation was found between an increased NOR count and tumor-related death during the first post-surgical year. The 39 bitches in which the tumor had an NOR count less than 8.0 had a generally favorable prognosis; only six (15%) died as a result of the original neoplasm. In contrast, 18/21 dogs (85%) with a carcinoma having an NOR count greater than 8.0 died from the tumor during the first post-surgical year. A similar, although less pronounced result was obtained specifically for invasive carcinomas, in which 3/12 (25%) tumors with an NOR count less than 6.0 resulted in the death of the host, compared with 17/20 (85%) that had an NOR count greater than 6. By using this technique, it is possible to identify a subgroup of bitches with invasive mammary carcinomas that have a very poor prognosis following apparently adequate surgical ablation of the primary tumor.", "Proteinase and gelatinolytic properties of a Triatoma infestans extract.\nAn extract of Triatoma infestans has previously been demonstrated to produce specific IgG and IgE both in animals and in atopic humans with rhinitis/asthma as well as hypersensitivity pneumonitis in guinea pigs aerosolized with T. infestans. We attempted to determine whether the antigen or antigens responsible belonged to the protease group, as occurs with other allergens such as house dust mites and cockroaches. To do this, T. infestans was studied by SDS-PAGE, Western blots and gelatinolysis with and without the use of specific protease inhibitors such as E-64, TLCK, TPCK, PMSF, leupeptin, o-phenanthrolene and pepstatin-A. These assays revealed serine-like proteolytic and gelatinolytic activities. The presence of 10 to 12 bands of between 14 and 100 kDa was detected. The proteolytic activity pattern of T. infestans was greatest at pH 8.5 and gelatinolytic activity was highly sensitive to PMSF, suggesting that this enzyme could be characterized as a serine protease. Western blots revealed that two bands of 17 and 58 kDA reacted with the sera of atopic humans with respiratory diseases and anti-IgE. However, whether these bands correlated with allergenicity is unclear since the presence of several proteins in each of these bands does not rule out the possibility that this correlation could exist, especially because cross-reactions with antigens from the cockroach Periplaneta americana and its specific antiserum in animals and atopic humans have been demonstrated. The role of proteases in the etiopathogenesis of perennial rhinitis and bronchial asthma in inhabitants of the area of Argentina infested by T. infestans requires further investigation.", "Role of calcium in the efflux system of Escherichia coli.\nEfflux of antibiotics by Escherichia coli AG100 is performed by a variety of efflux pumps, ensuring survival of the bacterium in widely diverse media. At pH 5, efflux is independent of metabolic energy during the period of time the assay is conducted; at pH 8 it is totally dependent upon metabolic energy. Because calcium ions (Ca(2+)) are important for membrane transport channels and the activity of ATPases that provide energy functions, the role of Ca(2+) in the extrusion of an efflux pump substrate under conditions that challenge the bacterium was investigated. Real-time accumulation and efflux of ethidium bromide (EtBr) by E. coli K-12 AG100 strain [argE3 thi-1 rpsL xyl mtl \u0394(gal-uvrB) supE44] was determined by a semi-automated fluorometric method in the presence and absence of Ca(2+) and agents that are known to inhibit access of calcium to enzymes that provide energy. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), an inhibitor of calcium binding to proteins (calcium-dependent enzymes), and ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), a chelator of Ca(2+), increased accumulation and efflux of EtBr at pH 8 but not at pH 5. Ca(2+) reverses these effects when the assay is conducted at pH 8. In conclusion, the activity of the efflux pump system of E. coli is dependent upon metabolic energy at pH 8. Because at pH 8 hydrolysis of ATP is favoured and contributes protons for activation of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, CPZ is suspected of having its effects on accumulation/efflux of EtBr by indirectly affecting ATPase activity that is dependent upon Ca(2+).", "Many multi-residential buildings built during the 20th century include no suite-level temperature control. Building temperature control is achieved by varying the temperature of the hydronic heating medium leaving the central plant. Control of the heating medium temperature is achieved using an \u201coutdoor reset curve\u201d, which defines the relationship between outdoor temperature and the temperature of the heating medium. For example, during a winter day the heating system control might measure an outdoor temperature of \u221210\u00b0 C., and then use the outdoor reset curve to determine a suitable heating medium setpoint temperature of 70\u00b0 C. The heating system control would then modulate the boiler plant output to maintain the heating medium temperature at this setpoint.\nThe outdoor reset curve is typically a linear relationship based on subjective values assigned by the technician when commissioning the heating control systems. The settings are rarely reviewed, and there is typically no systematic process or feedback for adjusting the outdoor reset curve. As a result, conventional heating control systems can result in wasted energy, unnecessary costs and greenhouse gas emissions.", "Preoperative controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score as a novel immune-nutritional predictor of survival in non-metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma of \u2264 7 cm on preoperative imaging.\nThis study aimed at investigating the prognostic value of Preoperative controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score in non-metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma of \u2264 7 cm on preoperative imaging. We retrospectively included 1046 among 1637 patients who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy for solid renal masses \u2264 7 cm (2005-2014) after excluding other pathology, conditions affecting CONUT score components, metastasis, regional lymphadenopathy, positive margin, and follow-up < 12 months. We defined high and low CONUT according to cut-off of (2). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis was used to predict factors affecting recurrence and survival. Kaplan-Meier curve was used for survival analysis. The median age and follow-up were 56 years and 63 months, respectively. 41 patients had recurrence (3.9%). CONUT was a predictor for recurrence-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival (HR 3.09, P = 0.003 and HR 4.66, P = 0.004 and HR 2.81, P = 0.003, respectively). A higher CONUT was significantly associated with worse 5 years recurrence-free (88.2% vs. 97.1%), cancer-specific (96.2% vs. 98.8%) and overall (90.9% vs. 96.5%) survival (log-rank, P = < 0.001, P = 0.006 and P = < 0.001, respectively). The preoperative CONUT is an independent prognostic marker for survival after curative surgery for non-metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma of \u2264 7 cm on preoperative imaging.", "Albimonas donghaensis gen. nov., sp. nov., a non-photosynthetic member of the class Alphaproteobacteria isolated from seawater.\nA moderately halophilic Gram-negative bacterium, strain DS2(T), was isolated from seawater from the East Sea in Korea. Strain DS2(T) grew at salinities of 0-14% (w/v) NaCl and at temperatures in the range 10-38 degrees C. The cells were non-motile short rods (1.0-1.4 microm in width and 1.6-2.6 microm in length) and the major fatty acids were C(18:1)omega7c and 11-methyl C(18:1)omega7c. The genomic DNA G+C content was 72.0 mol% and the predominant lipoquinone was Q-10. The major cellular phospholipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain DS2(T) formed a distinct phyletic line from the genus Rubrimonas within the Alphaproteobacteria. The levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with respect to the type strains of related genera were below 94%. On the basis of physiological and phylogenetic properties, strain DS2(T) represents a novel genus and species of the Alphaproteobacteria, for which the name Albimonas donghaensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is DS2(T) (=KCTC 12586(T)=DSM 17890(T)).", "Relevance of Nitrospira for nitrite oxidation in a marine recirculation aquaculture system and physiological features of a Nitrospira marina-like isolate.\nIn biofilters of recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS), nitrification by lithoautotrophic microorganisms is essential to prevent the cultivated organisms from intoxication with ammonium and nitrite. In moving-bed biofilters nitrifying microorganisms are immobilized together with heterotrophic bacteria in dense biofilms on carrier elements like plastic beads. Analyses of fatty acid profiles of these biofilms from a marine biofilter revealed a high abundance of Nitrospira-related lipid markers (8-12% of total fatty acids). Further results of a labeling experiment with (13) C-bicarbonate in mineral salts medium with 3 mM nitrite confirmed that Nitrospira is the major autotrophic nitrite oxidizer in the biofilter system. According to 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses the nitrite-oxidizing community in the biofilter consisted of at least two different representatives of Nitrospira, one of which could be successfully isolated. The marine isolate 'Ecomares 2.1' belongs to cluster IVa and showed 98.8% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Nitrospira marina, whereas the enrichment 'M1 marine' is only distantly related (94.0% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to N. marina). In laboratory experiments, the isolate exhibited remarkable tolerances against high substrate and product concentrations (30 mM nitrite and 80 mM nitrate) as well as ammonium (50 mM). During the isolation process a strong tendency of this strain to develop biofilms became apparent. Thus, Ecomares 2.1 seems to be well adapted to the attached lifestyle in biofilters and the nitrogenous load prevailing in the effluent waters of RAS. Both members of Nitrospira could be detected by PCR-based methods in environmental samples of marine and brackish RAS biofilters and are therefore considered to be characteristic for these engineered ecosystems.", "[Acute urinary retention secondary to giant prolapsed ureterocele in a young adult woman. Case report].\nUreterocele is a cystic dilation of the distal ureteral segment. The incidence in women ranges from 1/5,000 to 1/12,000. In adults, they are poorly diagnosed and are asymptomatic. Prolapse through the urethra is uncommon, and involves acute urine retention and a reducible vulvar tumour. Woman of 24 years old, two previous caesarean and two abortions. She had incomplete bladder emptying, intermittent voiding, bladder straining and tenesmus, three months before admission. After the voiding effort she presented with acute urine retention with sudden onset of tumour in the vulva. The tumour was manually reduced under regional anaesthesia. A cystoscopy was performed, finding an ischaemic de-roofing of the anterior wall of the ureterocele, causing vesicoureteral reflux grade IV. Surgical correction was performed with Cohen re-implantation and insertion of a double-J catheter. The catheter was removed 30 days later, with a successful post-operative course. Its aetiology is unclear, and most are diagnosed by ultrasound in the prenatal period. The clinical presentation is variable, from urinary tract infection to prolapse. Despite its size, it may cause complications such as ischaemic de-roofing, which if diagnosed soon may be resolved successfully, as with this patient. The results and treatment may be favourable when no renal impact or concomitant anatomical changes are present, as is the case of this patient.", "The protein tyrosine kinase substrate cortactin is differentially expressed in murine B lymphoid tumors.\nSrc family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) actively participate in signal transduction during lymphocyte activation. However, little is known about the roles of PTKs and their substrates in lymphocyte differentiation. To identify PTK substrates that may be differentially expressed during B lymphopoiesis, we screened a panel of murine B lymphoid tumor cell lines representing various developmental stages using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for pp60src substrates. A MAb specific for cortactin, a filamentous-actin binding pp60src substrate, immunoprecipitated proteins from murine plasma-cytoma cell lines but not from pre-B cell lymphoma or B cell lymphoma cell lines. We have cloned a murine cortactin cDNA which encodes a member of a family of proteins distinguished by amino-terminal repeat domains and carboxy-terminal Src Homology 3 domains. Two members of this family (cortactin and HS1) were differentially expressed in murine B lymphoid tumor cell lines; both were detected in plasmacytoma cell lines, however HS1 was additionally detected in pre-B lymphoma and B lymphoma cell lines. Cortactin RNA was detected in most murine tissues, but was not detected in B lymphocytes or plasma cells. We hypothesize that cortactin expression is associated with transformed plasma cells and not with the terminal differentiation of normal B lymphocytes to plasma cells.", "Quantitative analysis and reduction of the eco-toxicity risk of heavy metals for the fine fraction of automobile shredder residue (ASR) using H2O2.\nAutomobile shredder residue (ASR) fraction (size <0.25mm) can be considered as hazardous due to presence of high concentrations of heavy metals. Hydrogen peroxide combined with nitric acid has been used for the recovery of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ni, Pb, Cd and Cr) from the fine fraction of ASR. A sequential extraction procedure has also been used to determine the heavy metal speciation in the fine fraction of ASR before and after treatment. A risk analysis of the fine fraction of ASR before and after treatment was conducted to assess the bioavailability and eco-toxicity of heavy metals. These results showed that the recovery of heavy metals from ASR increased with an increase in the hydrogen peroxide concentration. A high concentration of heavy metals was found to be present in Cbio fractions (the sum of the exchangeable and carbonate fractions) in the fine fraction of ASR, indicating high toxicity risk. The Cbio rate of all selected heavy metals was found to range from 8.6% to 33.4% of the total metal content in the fine fraction of ASR. After treatment, Cbio was reduced to 0.3-3.3% of total metal upon a treatment with 2.0% hydrogen peroxide. On the basis of the risk assessment code (RAC), the environmental risk values for heavy metals in the fine fraction of ASR reflect high risk/medium risk. However, after treatment, the heavy metals would be categorized as low risk/no risk. The present study concludes that hydrogen peroxide combined with nitric acid is a promising treatment for the recovery and reduction of the eco-toxicity risk of heavy metals in ASR.", "Cerebrovascular burden and depressive symptomatology interrelate over 18 years: support for the vascular depression hypothesis.\nPotentially incongruent research literatures suggest three divergent hypotheses about depressive symptomatology: (1) symptoms are recurrent; (2) later-life depression results from high cerebrovascular burden (CVB); and (3) depressive symptoms contribute to comorbidities causing vascular burden. Past vascular depression research assumes that later-life depressive symptoms relate uniquely to high CVB and not to prior, recurrent depression. This study examines these divergent hypotheses. Data include 5175 participants across 18 years from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (mean age at 1993 baseline was 53 years; follow-ups in 2004 and 2011). Depressive symptomatology was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression. CVB was operationalized as hypertension, high blood sugar, diabetes, and other heart problems. Hypotheses were examined via a cross-lagged structural equation model and logistic regression. Model fit was acceptable (root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.047; comparative fit index = 0.963). Hypotheses 1 and 2 were supported. Depressive symptomatology at 2004 and 2011 follow-ups was predicted by earlier depressive symptomatology and prior CVB. Hypothesis 3 was partially supported; depressive symptomatology in 2004 predicted subsequent CVB. Logistic regression results were that CVB predicted clinically significant depressive symptoms based on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression clinical cutoff. Cerebrovascular burden in midlife predicts depressive symptomatology in later-life, even after accounting for prior depressive symptomatology, supporting a fundamental assumption of the vascular depression hypothesis. Midlife depressive symptomatology also predicted escalation of CVB in later-life. Results suggest a process model of later-life depressive symptom development that interrelates CVB and depressive symptoms throughout the life span and have clinical implications for the interruption of this process through the integration of primary care and behavioral health specialists.

Multicentric lymphomas in 10 dogs were prospectively evaluated for FR expression by use of immunohistochemical analysis and for in vivo folate uptake by use of nuclear scintigraphy. Dogs with FR-expressing tumors were eligible for FR-targeted chemotherapy. Twenty archival lymphoma biopsy specimens were also evaluated with immunohistochemical analysis. FRs were not detected with immunohistochemical analysis in lymph node samples obtained from the 10 dogs or in archival biopsy specimens. However, nuclear scintigraphy revealed uptake of radioactive tracer in 6 of 10 dogs. Five of these 6 dogs were treated with an FR-targeted chemotherapeutic agent; results of treatment were complete remission in 1 dog, stable disease in 2 dogs, and progressive disease in 2 dogs. Treatment-related toxicoses generally were mild. This study provided strong evidence for folate uptake in a substantial portion of multicentric lymphomas of dogs and indicated the antitumor activity of FR-targeted chemotherapeutics for these cancers. Use of FR-targeted chemotherapeutics may be promising for the treatment of FR-expressing multicentric lymphomas in dogs. Further studies are needed to determine reasons for lack of immunoreactivity to currently identified anti-FR antibodies and to develop improved methods for detecting FRs in lymphomas of dogs.", "The Effectiveness of Horticultural Therapy on Older Adults: A Systematic Review.\nAlthough the therapeutic effects of horticulture on older adults have been widely investigated, a recent and comprehensive synthesis of available evidence on outcomes is lacking. We systematically reviewed evidence for the therapeutic effects of horticulture on older adults. A systematic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Sage Journals, ProQuest, Science Direct, and CINAHL was conducted. Articles were selected if they were quantitative studies published in English from 2008 to 2018. Articles were selected if they included participants aged 60 years and older and used horticulture as the main intervention. Experimental studies were appraised using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale. The systematic search yielded 20 articles. Significant pre-post improvement was reported in quality of life, anxiety, depression, social relations, physical effects, and cognitive effects. However, between-group results were lacking or nonsignificant. There is evidence for benefits of horticulture among older adults, particularly in long-term care facilities. Nonetheless, as the robustness of evidence is lacking, more rigorous randomized controlled trials and between-group effects need to be investigated.", "Carbon monoxide promotes endothelium-dependent constriction of isolated gracilis muscle arterioles.\nVascular tissues express heme oxygenase, which metabolizes heme to form carbon monoxide (CO). CO promotes relaxation of vascular smooth muscle but also inhibits nitric oxide (NO) formation. This study examines the hypothesis that CO promotes endothelium- and NO synthase-dependent vasoconstriction of isolated arterioles. Studies were conducted on pressurized first-order gracilis muscle arterioles isolated from anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. Exogenous CO, as well as a heme precursor, delta-aminolevulinic acid (delta-ALA), constricted arterioles with intact endothelium pretreated with phenylephrine; these effects were abolished by removal of the endothelium. CO- and delta-ALA-induced vasoconstrictions were converted to dilations by pretreatment with an inhibitor of NO synthase, Nomega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, or with Nomega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester and an NO donor, sodium nitroprusside. Furthermore, CO-induced vasoconstriction was prevented by pretreatment with the NO synthase substrate l-arginine. This study shows that exogenous, as well as endogenously formed, CO can promote endothelium-dependent vasoconstriction in isolated gracilis muscle arterioles. Because CO-induced vasoconstriction is abolished by NO synthase blockade and by l-arginine, CO most likely promotes endothelium-dependent vasoconstriction by inhibiting endothelial NO formation.", "Antioxidant therapy reduces oxidative and inflammatory tissue damage in patients subjected to cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation.\nIschaemia reperfusion injury is a pathophysiological event that occurs after cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. This clinical event has been associated with the induction of oxidative and inflammatory damage in atrial tissue. Here, we tested whether combined omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA)-antioxidant vitamin protocol therapy reduces oxidative and inflammatory cardiac tissue damage. This trial assigned 95 either-sex patients to supplementation with n-3 PUFA (2 g/day), or matching placebo groups, 7 days before on-pump surgery. Antioxidant vitamins C (1 g/day) and E (400 IU/day) or placebo were added from 2 days before surgery until discharge. Blood and atrial tissue samples were obtained during the intervention. Reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio, malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonylation were determined in atrial tissue. Leucocyte count and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in blood plus nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baappaB activation in atrial tissue served for inflammation assessment. Lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation were 27.5 and 24% lower in supplemented patients (p < 0.01). GSH/GSSG ratio was 38.1% higher in supplemented patients compared with placebo (p < 0.01). Leucocyte count and serum hs-CRP levels were markedly lower throughout the protocol in supplemented patients (p < 0.01). Atrial tissue NF-\u03baB DNA activation in supplemented patients was 22.5% lower than that in placebo patients (p < 0.05). The combined n-3 PUFA-antioxidant vitamin protocol therapy here proposed reduced the oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers, in patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery.", "Does leukotriene C4 mediate hypoxic vasoconstriction in isolated ferret lungs?\nTo evaluate leukotriene (LT) C4 as a mediator of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, we examined the effects of FPL55712, a putative LT antagonist, and indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, on vasopressor responses to LTC4 and hypoxia (inspired O2 tension = 25 Torr) in isolated ferret lungs perfused with a constant flow (50 ml.kg-1.min-1). Pulmonary arterial injections of LTC4 caused dose-related increases in pulmonary arterial pressure during perfusion with physiological salt solution containing Ficoll (4 g/dl). FPL55712 caused concentration-related inhibition of the pressor response to LTC4 (0.6 micrograms). Although 10 micrograms/ml FPL55712 inhibited the LTC4 pressor response by 61%, it did not alter the response to hypoxia. At 100 microgram/ml, FPL55712 inhibited the responses to LTC4 and hypoxia by 73 and 71%, respectively, but also attenuated the vasoconstrictor responses to prostaglandin F2 alpha (78% at 8 micrograms), phenylephrine (68% at 100 micrograms), and KCl (51% at 40 mM). At 0.5 microgram/ml, indomethacin significantly attenuated the pressor response to arachidonic acid but did not alter responses to LTC4 or hypoxia. These results suggest that in isolated ferret lungs 1) the vasoconstrictor response to LTC4 did not depend on release of cyclooxygenase products and 2) LTC4 did not mediate hypoxic vasoconstriction.", "The potential of polymeric film-forming systems as sustained delivery platforms for topical drugs.\nDosing regimens requiring multiple daily applications frequently result in poor patient compliance, especially in the treatment of chronic skin diseases. Consequently, development of sustained delivery systems for topical drugs permitting less frequent dosing is of continuing interest for dermatological therapy. This potential of polymeric film-forming systems (FFS), created in situ on the skin, as sustained delivery platforms for topical drug delivery is reviewed. Key formulation parameters that determine delivery efficiency are considered focussing on those that permit a drug reservoir to be established in the upper layers of the skin and/or on the skin surface from which release can be sustained over a prolonged period. The advantageous and superior cosmetic attributes of FFS (compared to conventional semi-solid formulations) that offer significantly improved patient compliance are also addressed. The promise of polymeric FFS as convenient and aesthetic platforms for sustained topical drug delivery is clear. Manipulation of the formulation allows the delivery profile to be customized and optimized to take advantage of both a rapid, initial input of drug into the skin (likely due to a transient period of supersaturation) and a slower, controlled release over an extended time from the residual film created thereafter.", "Mood effects on memory and executive control in a real-life situation.\nIn the laboratory, studies have shown an inconsistent pattern of whether, and how, mood may affect cognitive functions indicating both mood-related enhancement as well as decline. Surprisingly, little is known about whether there are similar effects in everyday life. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate possible mood effects on memory and executive control in a real-life situation. Mood effects were examined in the context of winning in a sports competition. Sixty-one male handball players were tested with an extensive cognitive test battery (comprising memory and executive control) both after winning a match and after training as neutral baseline. Mood differed significantly between the two testing situations, while physiological arousal and motivation were comparable. Results showed lowered performance after the win compared with training in selected cognitive measures. Specifically, short-term and episodic memory performance was poorer following a win, whereas executive control performance was unaffected by condition. Differences in memory disappeared when emotional states after the match were entered as covariates into the initial analyses. Thus, findings suggest mood-related impairments in memory, but not in executive control processes after a positive real-life event.", "Purification and properties of alpha-galactosidase from immature stalks of Saccharum officinarum (sugar cane).\nThe immature sugar cane stalks studied contained less than 7% sucrose, and showed the activities of enzymes such as invertase, alpha-galactosidase, alpha-mannosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, beta-glucosidase, beta-xylosidase, and beta-galactosidase. The alpha-galactosidase was highly purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 column, ionexchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, and CM-cellulose columns, and heat treatment (60 degrees C, 15 min) in the presence of 0.2 m D-galactose. In polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified enzyme was homogeneous, having a molecular weight of approximately 46,000. In gelfiltration, it was approximately 47,000. The activity was optimum at pH 4.5 and at 60 degrees C. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside (Km, 0.83 mM; Vmax, 25.0 mumol/mg/min), raffinose (Km, 25.9 mM; Vmax, 15.4 mumol/mg/min), and stachyose (Km, 13.0 mM; Vmax 2.7 mumol/mg/min), in addition to melibiose, guar gum, and locust bean gum. The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside was markedly inhibited by HgCl2, AgNO3, p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB), L-ascorbic acid, melibiose, stachyose, and D-galactose. Also the purified enzyme showed a lectin activity with trypsinized erythrocytes.", "Association between statin use and plasma D-dimer levels. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.\nD-dimers, specific breakdown fragments of cross-linked fibrin, are generally used as circulating markers of activated coagulation. Statins influence haemostatic factors, but their effect on plasma D-dimer levels is controversial. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the association between statin therapy and plasma D-dimer levels. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus and EMBASE (up to September 25, 2014) to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the impact of statin therapy on plasma D-dimer levels. Two independent reviewers extracted data on study characteristics, methods and outcomes. Meta-analysis of data from nine RCTs with 1,165 participants showed a significant effect of statin therapy in reducing plasma D-dimer levels (standardised mean difference [SMD]: -0.988 \u00b5g/ml, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: -1.590 - -0.385, p=0.001). The effect size was robust in sensitivity analysis and omission of no single study significantly changed the overall estimated effect size. In the subgroup analysis, the effect of statins on plasma D-dimer levels was significant only in the subsets of studies with treatment duration \u2265 12 weeks (SMD: -0.761 \u00b5g/ml, 95 %CI: -1.163- -0.360; p< 0.001), and for lipophilic statins (atorvastatin and simvastatin) (SMD: -1.364 \u00b5g/ml, 95 % CI: -2.202- -0.526; p=0.001). Hydrophilic statins (pravastatin and rosuvastatin) did not significantly reduce plasma D-dimer levels (SMD: -0.237 \u00b5g/ml, 95 %CI: -1.140-0.665, p=0.606). This meta-analysis of RCTs suggests a decrease of plasma D-dimer levels after three months of statin therapy, and especially after treatment with lipophilic statins. Well-designed trials are required to validate these results.", "Rarefication of the arterioles and capillary network in the brain of rats with different forms of hypertension.\nThe angioarchitecture of rat brain with deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-saline and renal forms of experimental hypertension were studied and compared with those of normotensive rats. The number of pial arteries of the third, fourth, and fifth order of branching was lower and their diameter smaller in hypertensive animals as compared with controls. In the medulla oblongata, pons, and mesencephalon the number of arterioles was lower and the total length of capillaries per unit volume was shorter in the experimental group. Rarefication of the capillary network was observed also in rats with spontaneous hypertension. Rarefication was found to begin at the earliest stage of developing hypertension. It was observed as soon as 24 hr after the ligation of the remaining kidney in rats with unilateral nephrectomy. A substantial decrease was recorded in the number of pial arteries with preserved lumens. The hypothesis that the rarefaction of the vascular net in the brain may lead to the formation of zones of ischemia is presented here.", "Placental Pathologic Associations With Morbidly Adherent Placenta: Potential Insights Into Pathogenesis.\nBackground The pathology that underlies morbidly adherent placenta (MAP) is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to describe the placental pathology, especially implantation site pathology, associated with MAP. Methods This was a single institution, retrospective case-control study design examining placentas of patients who delivered between January 2008 and September 2013. MAP cases were defined by the need for clinical intervention at delivery beyond spontaneous placental delivery or simple manual extraction of the placenta. Controls consisted of patients with placentas sent for examination due to a history of maternal malignancy with no clinical suspicion of accreta. Placental pathologic findings of maternal vascular underperfusion (MVU), acute inflammation, chronic inflammation, fetal vascular obstruction, and hemorrhage were recorded and compared using bivariable and multivariable analyses. Results Three categories of pathologic changes were seen more commonly in MAP placentas (N = 101) than control placentas (N = 110): chronic basal inflammation, villous changes of MVU, and retromembranous and subchorionic/intervillous hemorrhage. In multivariable analyses adjusted for confounders, basal chronic villitis (aOR 5.6, 1.73-18.18), plasma cell deciduitis (aOR 2.63, 1.08-6.39), increased syncytial knots (aOR 3.92, 1.57-9.75), villous agglutination (aOR 24.85, 2.78-221.75), increased perivillous fibrin (aOR 5.08, 1.49-17.34), and the presence of subchorionic/intervillous thrombi (aOR 4.01, 1.63-9.86) remained associated with MAP. Conclusions MAP is highly associated with evidence of intraparenchymal placental hemorrhage, villous changes of MVU, and a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate at the implantation site. The contribution of this basal chronic inflammatory infiltrate to MAP requires further investigation.", "Effects of hypertension and hypercarbia on spinal cord tissue oxygen in acute experimental spinal cord injury.\nSpinal cord tissue oxygen was measured by polarography at the dorsum of the spinal cord for 24 hours after acute spinal cord injury, and the effects of hypertension, hypercarbia, and hyperoxia were examined. Acute spinal cord injury was produced in mongrel dogs by constriction of the midthoracic cord with an epidural tourniquet inflated to 400 mm Hg, which was maintained for 5 minutes. At the injury site spinal cord tissue oxygen was slightly increased immediately after injury but was depressed significantly at 1 hour and remained unchanged thereafter. Hypertension induced by the intravenous infusion of norepinephrine elevated the tissue oxygen only slightly after 3 hours. Hypercarbia and hyperoxia produced by ventilation with a 95% O2:5% CO2 mixture did not elevate the depressed spinal cord oxygen content. When hypertension, hypercarbia, and hyperoxia were combined, the spinal cord oxygen value was elevated to the normal level even at 3 hours after injury, when the cord oxygen was at its lowest, and it increased steadily thereafter.", "[Left ventricular diastolic function in subjects with arterial hypertension living in the Far North depending on the work schedule].\nLeft ventricular diastolic function (LVDF) was studied in subjects with arterial hypertension (AH) living in the Far North in relation to their working regime. A total of 95 patients with grade I-II AH were divided into two groups, one including 53 dayworkers the other comprising 42 patients working in shifts. The control group included 25 practically healthy subjects. All the patients were examined by Doppler echocardiography. Analysis of the results demonstrated that patients with AH working night shifts more frequently experienced LVDF disturbances than subjects of other groups. These disturbances included increased contribution of the left atrial systole to left ventricle filling. Patients with AH exhibited the well-apparent dependence of left ventricle diastolic filling on the degree of its hypertrophy. LVDF was related to the elevation of nocturnal arterial pressure due to a rise in systolic AP.", "Lactacidosis in the neonate is minimized by prenatal detection of congenital heart disease.\nTo investigate the impact of prenatal detection of congenital heart disease on preventing severe preoperative lactacidosis. Patients operated upon for congenital heart disease during the first 31 days of life (n = 209) were studied retrospectively, 21 were diagnosed prenatally and 188 patients had not been diagnosed prenatally. Preoperative lactate, pH and base excess were evaluated. Differences were noted in preoperative pH (7.28 +/- 0.03 vs. 7.24 +/- 0.01, P = 0.29), base excess (-5.83 +/- 0.64 vs. -6.93 +/- 0.46 mmol/L, P = 0.10) and lactate (3.05 +/- 0.35 vs. 6.08 +/- 0.45 mmol/L, P < 0.001), indicating a significant difference in blood lactate values in favor of the prenatally diagnosed group. Prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease and the resulting immediate postnatal care prevent lactate increase in the preoperative period of these patients. This may decrease the risk of cerebral damage and result in the patient being in better condition at surgery.", "Application of resampling techniques to improve the quality of survival analysis risk curves for human frontal bone fracture.\nIn automotive events, head injuries (skull fractures and/or brain injuries) are associated with head contact loading. While the widely-used head injury criterion is based on frontal bone fracture and linear accelerations, injury risk curves were not developed from original datasets. Develop skull fracture-based risk curves for using previously published data and apply resampling techniques to assess their qualities. Force, deflection, energy, and stiffness data from thirteen human cadaver head impact tests were used to develop risk curves using parametric survival analysis. Injuries occurred to all specimens. Data points were treated as uncensored. Variables were ranked, and the variable best explaining the underlying fracture response was determined using the Brier Score Metric (BSM). The qualities of the risk curves were determined using normalized confidence interval sizes. Statistical resampling methods were used to assess the quality of the risk curves and the impact of the sample size by conducting 2000 simulations. Sample sizes ranged from 13 to 26. The Weibull distribution was optimal for all the response variables, except deflection (log-logistic). The quality of the risk curves was the highest for deflection. This variable best explained the underlying head injury response, based on BSM. Improvements in the quality of the risk curves were achieved with additional samples of force and deflection (<13), while energy and stiffness variables required more size. Individual risk curves are given. These probability curves from head contact loading add to the understanding skull fractures and can be used to improve safety in injury producing environments.", "Peripheral vascular response to norepinephrine at temperatures from 2 to 40 degrees C.\nThe response to norepinephrine (NE) was studied in the perfused whole vascular bed and perfused arteries in situ and on helical strips of arteries and veins from the isolated duck leg. NE consistently produced vasoconstriction but the sensitivity was 3-50 times greater in the whole vascular bed than in artery segments. The drug effect was maximal at temperatures near 25 degrees C and diminished considerably at low temperatures (2-5 degrees C). Isolated helical strips of arteries and veins, when exposed to NE, showed maximal developed force at 25-30 degrees C. Tibial vessels developed only slight force at 5 degrees C while the tarsal-metatarsal and digital vessels responded even at 2 degrees C. The sensitivity to NE of both vessel types from the same region was similar. Flow in whole vascular bed perfused at constant pressure (40 cmH2O) was maximum at 30-35 degrees C. At both higher and lower temperatures flow declined and was about the same at 2 degrees C as at 40 degrees C. Our findings indicate that the vasoconstrictor effect of NE is exerted on both large and small veins and arteries; yet peripheral vessels respond more than do proximal segments at low temperatures. These findings suggest that peripheral vascular compartments may be capable of regulating regional blood flow at temperatures approaching freezing.", "[125I]diiodoinsulins. Binding affinities, biologic potencies, and properties of their decay products.\nInsulin was iodinated with 0.3-0.4 mol 125I/mol insulin using the lactoperoxidase method. About one-third of the radioactivity incorporated into insulin was in diiodoinsulins and about 40% of these molecules contained diiodotyrosine in residue 14 of the A chain. Most of the remaining molecules contained one A14-monoiodotyrosine and one monoiodotyrosine in either position A19, B16, or B26. The binding affinity and biologic potency of this heterogeneous diiodoinsulin preparation was not significantly different from that of A14-[125I]monoiodoinsulin in rat adipocytes, whereas it was slightly reduced in hepatocytes and IM-9 lymphocytes. From the iodine distribution and previous data on the binding affinity of each of the four monoiodoinsulin isomers it was calculated that A14-diiodotyrosine-insulin possesses full binding affinity and biologic potency in adipocytes. Diiodoinsulins isolated from another iodoinsulin preparation (iodate method) contained 58% A19-diiodotyrosine-insulin, and most remaining molecules contained one A19-monoiodotyrosine. The binding affinity of this mixed diiodoinsulin preparation was approximately one-fourth of that of A14-monoiodoinsulin in adipocytes, IM-9 lymphocytes, and hepatocytes. It was calculated that A19-diiodotyrosine-insulin is nearly devoid of binding affinity. The diiodoinsulins (lactoperoxidase method) decayed to iodide (probably from diiodotyrosine-insulin) or to polymers with little specific but a markedly increased nonspecific binding. In addition, the polymers had a marked tendency to adsorb to cellulose acetate filters. 1. The binding affinities of diiodoinsulins range from very low values to values at least as high as that of insulin depending on the positions of the iodine moieties. 2. The relative binding affinities vary among tissues. 3. Polymeric decay products give high nonspecific binding.", "Dietary fructooligosaccharides increase calcium absorption and levels of mucosal calbindin-D9k in the large intestine of gastrectomized rats.\nIn gastrectomized rats intestinal calcium absorption and bone calcium levels markedly decrease and the levels recover as a result of feeding fructooligosaccharides (FOS). In the present study we examined the effects of gastrectomy and dietary FOS on intestinal calbindin-D9k (CaBP) levels. One group of rats was subjected to a sham operation and fed a control diet. Two other groups of rats were gastrectomized, and those in one group were fed the control diet, whereas those in the other group were fed a diet containing 10% FOS. Intestinal calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus absorption levels and intestinal CaBP levels were measured. Gastrectomy increased CaBP levels in the distal small intestine, cecum, and colorectum but markedly decreased calcium absorption. Dietary FOS increased CaBP levels in the cecum and colorectum in the case of gastrectomized rats and improved calcium absorption. The results suggest that dietary FOS not only improve intestinal calcium absorption but also serve to maintain local calcium homeostasis in the intestine by increasing mucosal CaBP levels in the large intestine of gastrectomized rats.", "[Testosterone replacement therapy and cardiovascular risk].\nLate onset hypogonadism (LOH) is the most commonly used term to indicate the age-dependent reduction of testosterone. Sexual dysfunction represents the most important determinant for medical consultation and the most specific symptoms associated with LOH. In particular, data from the European Male Ageing Study (EMAS), a population-based survey on more than 3400 subjects, recognized that a triad of sexual symptoms (low libido and reduced spontaneous and sex-related erections) is the only syndromic association with decreased testosterone levels. Accordingly, a meta-analysis of the available randomized controlled trials documented that testosterone therapy (TTh) is able to improve all aspects of sexual function when compared to placebo. Despite this evidence, however, the relative clinical significance and the potential benefit of TTh in LOH are still the subject of strong criticisms in the scientific community. The debate is further complicated by the recent position statement of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emphasizing a possible increased cardiovascular risk of TTh. However, this position was not endorsed by the European Medicines Association (EMA), which reached an opposite position after a specific review of the available data. In this review, all the conflicting data supporting the different positions of the FDA and EMA will be discussed. In particular, data derived from either population-based studies or interventional trials will be analyzed in detail. Although some evidence suggests an increase in TTh-related cardiovascular risk, the data derived from controlled trials do not support this position especially when the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events are considered. Symptomatic men with documented reduced testosterone levels can be safely treated with TTh.", "Preparation of sequence-controlled triblock copolymer-grafted silica microparticles by sequential-ATRP for highly efficient glycopeptides enrichment.\nAs one of the most important subproteomes in eukaryote cells, N-glycoproteins play crucial roles in various of biological processes and have long been considered closely correlated with the occurrence, progression, and metastasis of cancer. Comprehensive characterization of protein N-glycosylation and association of their aberrant patterns to the corresponding cancer stage may provide a unique way to discover new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic drug targets. However, the extremely complex nature of biological samples and relatively low abundance of N-glycosylated proteins makes the enrichment of glycoprotein/glycopeptide a prerequisite for large scale N-glycosylation identification. In this work, we prepared sequence controlled triblock copolymer grafted silica-microparticles (TCP-SMs) by sequential atom transfer radical polymerization (sequential-ATRP) of monosaccharides and zwitterionic-ion monomers for highly efficient and selective glycopeptides enrichment. The triblock copolymer is composed of sequence defined poly zwitterionic-ion, poly-N-acetylglucosamine and poly mannose blocks. The glycopolymer blocks carrying densely packed pendent sugars are excellent mimics of the natural carbohydrate clusters and may induce multivalent carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction (CCI) with the target glycopeptides. Therefore, increased retention of glycopeptides can be expected by the combination of CCI and zwitterionic-HILIC interaction. As a result, 1244 glycopeptides were identified after TCP-SMs enrichment from mouse liver, which are 65-120% higher than that obtained by homoglycopolymer or random-copolymer grafted silica microparticles prepared using the conventional free radical polymerization. These results demonstrate the critical role of sequence-defined block copolymer of TCP-SMs for obtaining enhanced affinity toward glycopeptides and the potential of this sequential-ATRP strategy to integrate different affinity moieties into one enrichment material to achieve deeper coverage in protein PTM mapping.", "Lunasin does not slow ALS progression: results of an open-label, single-center, hybrid-virtual 12-month trial.\nObjective: Lunasin, a soy peptide that reportedly alters histone acetylation in vitro, was associated with a single ALS reversal in the media. Following an ALSUntangled report, we sought to determine whether Lunasin altered histone acetylation and improved progression in people with ALS, and whether patient-centric trial design features might improve enrollment and retention. Methods: This single-center, year-long trial (NCT02709330) featured broad inclusion criteria, historical controls, primarily virtual data collection, and real-time results. Participants measured their own ALSFRS-R score, weight and perceived efficacy, and recorded these monthly on PatientsLikeMe. Blood tests at screening and month 1 assessed alterations in histone H3 and H4 acetylation. The protocol was published online, empowering patients outside the study to self-experiment. Results: Fifty participants enrolled in 5.5 months. Although this population had more advanced disease compared to other trials, retention and adherence were very high. There was no significant effect of Lunasin treatment on histone acetylation or disease progression. A cohort following our protocol outside the trial reported similar side effects and perceived effectiveness; however, their compliance with data entry was markedly lower. Conclusions: While Lunasin's lack of efficacy is disappointing, our novel trial design had the highest ALS trial enrollment rate ever recorded, with excellent retention and adherence. Low data density from patients who are self-experimenting outside a formal protocol casts doubt on the possibility of gathering useful information from unsupervised expanded access programs or \"right to try\" initiatives.", "Depletion of endothelial progenitor cells in the peripheral blood of patients with ulcerative colitis.\nThere is strong evidence to suggest that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a significant role in re-endothelialization and subsequent tissue repair. This study examined the role of EPCs in inflammatory bowel disease, a disease in which impairment of mucosal healing has been implicated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 50 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 29 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 14 patients with infectious colitis, and 35 normal control subjects were cultured in EPC medium, harvested after 7 days, and characterized by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. Colony assay for hematopoietic progenitor cells was also performed. Patients with active UC had a significantly decreased number of circulating EPCs as compared with healthy controls (p=0.0013), patients with inactive UC (p=0.0099), patients with active CD (p=0.0235) and patients with infectious colitis (p=0.0002). On the other hand, patients with infectious colitis had a significantly increased number of circulating EPCs as compared with healthy controls (p=0.0406), patients with active UC (p=0.0002), and patients with active CD (p=0.0316). In patients with UC, the number of circulating EPCs was correlated with the serum hemoglobin levels (r=0.485, p=0.007) and inversely with the platelet count (r=-0.372, p=0.0382). The number of hematopoietic progenitor cell colonies was comparable among patients with UC, patients with CD, patients with infectious colitis, and healthy controls. Our observations indicate that the number of circulating EPCs in patients with UC is significantly reduced. Further studies are needed to define the mechanisms that underlie the reduction in the number of circulating EPCs and to better understand the pathophysiological consequences of this event in patients with UC.", "[Report of five cases of severe neonatal Plasmodium vivax malaria in Urab\u00e1, Colombia].\nNeonatal malaria is a type of malaria that occurs during the first month of life. In the last half century, the reports of malaria parasites in neonates generally have been associated with congenital transmission. However, in recent years, cases have appeared with increasing frequency, especially in Africa. In Latin America, the incidence of neonatal malaria is unknown, with only isolated cases reported. Cases of neonatal malaria were identified and characterized to better recognize the frequency and symptoms of cases as they occur in Colombia. Between March 2002-March 2004, a search for cases of neonatal malaria was made in the hospitals of the Turbo and Apartad\u00f3 counties (Urab\u00e1, Antioquia Province). The following date were compiled: (1) characteristics of the mother, (2) demographic characteristics of the neonates, (3) clinical characteristics of the disease, and (4) laboratory results. Five cases were discovered of neonatal vivax malaria; however, only one met the criteria for congenital infection. Three patients had institutional delivery and two had a maternal history of gestational malaria, but none underwent a screening test for malaria. One of the four mothers were primaparous and half of them were younger than 20 years. All neonates had fever and presented some sign of severe disease during the first medical examination; each had hemoglobin levels compatible with severe neonatal anemia. No neonate had received the recommended treatment for this type of malaria. Five cases of severe neonatal malaria were reported, caused by infections of P. vivax, which normally does not produce severe disease. Since none of the malaria cases were recognized or treated at the local hospitals, advisories to medical professionals are recommended concerning neonatal malaria, particularly in endemic regions.", "Autoimmune diseases, infections, use of antibiotics and the risk of acute myeloid leukaemia: a national population-based case-control study.\nPrevious studies reported increased risk of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in individuals with inflammatory conditions. However, it is unclear whether this association is explained by preceding cytotoxic therapy or haematological diseases. We conducted a nationwide case-control study that included 3053 AML patients, diagnosed in Denmark between 2000 and 2013, and 30 530 sex- and age-matched population controls. We retrieved information on autoimmune disease, infections, and use of antibiotics and computed odds ratios for AML (conditional logistic regression). Results were stratified by AML type, sex, and age. Autoimmune diseases were associated with an overall increased risk of AML {odds ratio [OR] 1\u00b73 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1\u00b71-1\u00b75]}. However, the risk was confined to patients with previous haematological disease or cytotoxic therapy exposure [secondary/therapy-related AML (sAML/tAML0) OR 2\u00b70 (95% CI = 1\u00b76-2\u00b76)] and not de novo AML [OR 1\u00b71 (95% CI = 0\u00b79-1\u00b73)]. Similarly, any prior infection requiring hospitalization was associated with a higher risk of AML [OR 1\u00b73 (95% CI = 1\u00b71-1\u00b74)]. Again, this association was evident for sAML/tAML [OR 1\u00b78 (95% CI = 1\u00b75-2\u00b72)], and not de novo AML [OR 1\u00b71 (95% CI = 1\u00b70-1\u00b72)]. In conclusion, autoimmune diseases and infections were associated with an increased AML risk only in subjects with prior haematological disease and/or cytotoxic treatment. These observations suggest, that inflammation plays - if any - a minor role for the development of de novo AML.", "Correlation between CT-based measured renal volumes and nuclear-renography-based split renal function in living kidney donors. Clinical diagnostic utility and practice patterns.\nLiving donor evaluation involves imaging to determine the choice of kidney for nephrectomy. Our aim was to study the diagnostic accuracy and correlation between CT-based volume measurements and split renal function (SRF) as measured by nuclear renography in potential living donors and its impact on kidney selection decision. We analyzed 190 CT-based volume measurements in healthy donors, of which 65 donors had a radionuclide study performed to determine SRF. There were no differences in demographics, anthropometric measurements, total volumes, eGFR, creatinine clearances between those who required a nuclear scan and those who did not. There was a significant correlation between CT-volume-measurement-based SRF and nuclear-scan-based SRF (Pearson coefficient r 0.59; p < 0.001). Furthermore, selective nuclear-based SRF allowed careful selection of donor nephrectomy, leaving the donor with the higher functioning kidney in most cases. There was also a significantly higher number of right-sided nephrectomies selected after nuclear-based SRF studies. CT-based volume measurements in living donor imaging have sufficient correlation with nuclear-based SRF. Selective use of nuclear-scan-based SRF allows careful selection for donor nephrectomy.", "A diary after dinner: How the time of event recording influences later accessibility of diary events.\nRecording the events of a day in a diary may help improve their later accessibility. An interesting question is whether improvements in long-term accessibility will be greater if the diary is completed at the end of the day, or after a period of sleep, the following morning. We investigated this question using an internet-based diary method. On each of five days, participants (n = 109) recorded autobiographical memories for that day or for the previous day. Recording took place either in the morning or in the evening. Following a 30-day retention interval, the diary events were free recalled. We found that participants who recorded their memories in the evening before sleep had best memory performance. These results suggest that the time of reactivation and recording of recent autobiographical events has a significant effect on the later accessibility of those diary events. We discuss our results in the light of related findings that show a beneficial effect of reduced interference during sleep on memory consolidation and reconsolidation.", "A Fast and Easily Parallelizable Biosensor Method for Measuring Extractable Tetracyclines in Soils.\nQuantification of extractable antibiotics in soils is important to assessing their bioavailability and mobility, and ultimately their ecotoxicological and health risks. This study aimed to establish a biosensor method for detecting extractable tetracyclines in soils (Alfisol, Mollisol, and Ultisol) using whole-cell biosensors containing a reporter plasmid (pMTGFP or pMTmCherry) carrying fluorescent protein genes tightly controlled by tetracyclines-responsive control region (tetRO). This whole-cell biosensor method can simultaneously measure 96 or more samples within 6 h and is easily parallelizable, whereas a typical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method may require 7 times more of analysis time and much greater cost to achieve similar analytical throughput. The biosensor method had a detection limit for each of six tetracyclines between 5.32-10.2 \u03bcg/kg soil, which is considered adequate for detecting tetracyclines in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) extracts of soils. Relative standard deviation was between 19.8-51.2% for the biosensor Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1/pMTGFP and 2.98-25.8% for E. coli DH5\u03b1/pMTmCherry, respectively, suggesting that E. coli DH5\u03b1/pMTmCherry was superior to E. coli DH5\u03b1/pMTGFP for detecting extractable tetracyclines in soils. This new, fast, easily parallelizable, and cost-effective biosensor method has the potential for measuring extractable concentrations of tetracyclines for a large number of soil samples in large-scale monitoring studies.", "Fluorescence labelling of extracellular vesicles using a novel thiol-based strategy for quantitative analysis of cellular delivery and intracellular traffic.\nExtracellular vesicles, including exosomes, are naturally derived nanovesicles generated in and released by numerous cell types. As extracellular entities they have the capacity to interact with neighbouring cells and distant tissues and affect physiological processes as well as being implicated in numerous diseases including tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration. They are also under intense investigation as delivery vectors for biotherapeutics. The ways in which EVs interact with recipient cells to influence cell physiology and deliver a macromolecular payload are at the early stages of exploration. A significant challenge within these studies is the ability to label EVs directly or indirectly with fluorescent probes to allow visualization without compromising functionality. Here, we present a thiol-based fluorescence labelling method allowing comprehensive analysis of the cellular uptake of prostate cancer derived EVs in live cells using confocal microscopy. Labelling of the EVs in this way did not influence their size and had no effect on their ability to induce differentiation of lung fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. For endocytosis analyses, depletion of key endocytic proteins and the use of chemical inhibitors (Dynasore, EIPA, Rottlerin and IPA-3) indicated that fluid-phase endocytosis and/or macropinocytosis was involved in EV internalisation. Over a period of six hours EVs were observed to increasingly co-localise with lysosomes, indicating a possible termination point following internalisation. Overall this method provides new opportunities for analysing the cellular dynamics of EVs as biological entities affecting cell and whole body physiology as well as investigating their potential as drug delivery vectors.", "Induction and spontaneous regression of intense pulmonary neuroendocrine cell differentiation in a model of preneoplastic lung injury.\nPulmonary neuroendocrine cell (PNEC) hyperplasia is associated with chronic lung diseases in humans, where it is thought to play a role in reparative responses to lung injury. To investigate the kinetics of strongly induced PNEC hyperplasia in an animal model, we exposed hamsters to a combination of hyperoxia (60% O2) and diethylnitrosamine (DEN) for up to 20 weeks. We thus demonstrate not only the induction but also spontaneous regression of intense PNEC differentiation and growth, which are much more intense than those observed with DEN alone. Lung tissues were immunostained for serotonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), calcitonin (CT), and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) (mammalian bombesin). Between 9 and 12 weeks of treatment, the number of CGRP- and serotonin-positive neuroepithelial bodies per cm airway epithelium increased over 10-fold, and CT became detectable. The number of neuroepithelial bodies immunostained for CGRP, serotonin, and CT peaked at 12-14 weeks of treatment, thereafter regressing to near-control levels by 20 weeks, in spite of continued DEN/O2 treatment. Simultaneously, by 6-7 weeks of treatment, there was a significant increase in the mean number of CGRP-positive cells per neuroepithelial body, which continued to rise up to double control levels, with a plateau at 13-20 weeks. GRP and pro-GRP immunostaining were not detectable at any time point. Polymerase chain reaction analyses of neuroendocrine-specific mRNAs demonstrated that CGRP, CT, and GRP mRNAs (normalized for beta-actin) peaked in lung tissues from most animals at 9-14 weeks after the beginning of DEN/O2 treatment, with decreased expression at 16-20 weeks. These data suggest that regulation of levels of these neuropeptides may be primarily transcriptional. This model may be a valuable system for analyzing mechanisms of induction and regression of normal PNEC differentiation and growth.", "Steric factors in the pharmacokinetics of lindane and alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane in rats.\n1. The elimination of alpha-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH) by rats, as assessed by g.l.c. determination of the chemical's disappearance from depot fat, exhibited a sex difference (males:females = 4:1) and a sizeable deuterium isotope effect (6.3 in males). 2. Lindane (gamma-HCH), by contrast, disappeared from depot fat, skeletal muscle, brain and blood at nearly the same rates in both sexes. Perdeuteration, though effective in reducing hepatic removal, did not significantly retard the overall elimination of this isomer (isotope effect in males less than 2). Partial explanation of this finding is that lindane and lindane-d6 are equally subject to dechlorination in the gut. 3. alpha-HCH distributed into cerebral white matter in preference to grey matter to a much higher degree than did lindane and the beta-isomer of HCH, and elimination from that tissue was slow. The finding is considered to indicate a stereoselective affinity of alpha-HCH to some component(s) of myelin.", "Pulmonary vascular reactivity and ischaemia-reperfusion injury in the rat.\n1. The endothelium has been shown to modulate the pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia in the rat. Acute lung injury is associated with loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and increased pulmonary vascular permeability. Similar loss of the vascular response to hypoxia is seen after ischaemia-reperfusion injury of the myocardium. 2. The effects of reperfusion injury on pulmonary endothelial integrity, as shown by the albumin escape index and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, were investigated in isolated, blood-perfused rat lungs. 3. Ischaemia for 0.5 h, which itself caused no increase in the albumin escape index, was followed by reperfusion for 0.25 h, 0.5 h and 1 h. Controls were subjected to 2 h of perfusion only (n = 5 in all groups). The pulmonary pressor response to hypoxia (fractional inspired oxygen concentration, 3%) was measured before and after ischaemia-reperfusion, and the dilator response to acetylcholine was measured after ischaemia-reperfusion in all cases. 4. Ischaemia-reperfusion significantly increased the albumin escape index after 0.5 h (mean +/- SEM, 1.40 +/- 0.27) and 1 h (2.0 +/- 0.30) compared with controls (0.54 +/- 0.30, P < 0.05 in both cases). The pulmonary pressor response to hypoxia was augmented significantly after reperfusion when compared with baseline hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (change from baseline: 13.2 +/- 4.63 and 22.2 +/- 7.1% after 0.5 and 1.0 h of reperfusion, respectively, P < 0.05). Vasorelaxation of sustained hypoxic vasoconstriction using acetylcholine was similar in both control lungs and those subjected to ischaemia-reperfusion. 5. These results suggest tht the pressor response to hypoxia is augmented after damage to the pulmonary vascular endothelium induced by ischaemic-reperfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "Characterization of a prolyl endoprotease from Eurygaster integriceps Puton (Sunn pest) infested wheat.\nSunn pest, Eurygaster integriceps, Puton, infested and uninfested wheat seeds were obtained from the International Center for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), Aleppo, Syria, with the primary objective to identify the type of enzyme deposited by the Sunn pest on the wheat responsible for the gluten degradation. Enzyme levels were extremely low due to the enzyme being secreted by the insect in localized areas on the seed. Only extract from the infested wheat contained glutenase activity. Anion exchange, Cu(2+) sepharose, and gel filtration chromatography were used to partially purify and enrich protein samples from both infested wheat and uninfested wheat. An SDS-gluten assay was used to show gluten specificity while a commercially available chromogenic proline peptide, benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-p-nitroanalide (ZGPpNA), was utilized to identify fractions containing the active proline specific enzyme activity and to determine Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Despite low levels of enzyme on the infested wheat, the enzyme was partially purified and enriched exhibiting a specific activity of 4.5 U/mg of total protein for gluten in a SDS gluten assay (1 U of enzyme activity was defined as the decrease in gel height in millimeters in 1 h) and exhibited a high-affinity Km of 65 microM for ZGPpNA, cleaving at the carboxy terminus of the proline residue. The enzyme exhibited optimal activity between pH 8 and 10.0 at temperatures between 20 degrees and 35 degrees C. The enzyme was identified to be a prolyl endoprotease.", "Targeting cellular prion protein reverses early cognitive deficits and neurophysiological dysfunction in prion-infected mice.\nCurrently, no treatment can prevent the cognitive and motor decline associated with widespread neurodegeneration in prion disease. However, we previously showed that targeting endogenous neuronal prion protein (PrP(C)) (the precursor of its disease-associated isoform, PrP(Sc)) in mice with early prion infection reversed spongiform change and prevented clinical symptoms and neuronal loss. We now show that cognitive and behavioral deficits and impaired neurophysiological function accompany early hippocampal spongiform pathology. Remarkably, these behavioral and synaptic impairments recover when neuronal PrP(C) is depleted, in parallel with reversal of spongiosis. Thus, early functional impairments precede neuronal loss in prion disease and can be rescued. Further, they occur before extensive PrP(Sc) deposits accumulate and recover rapidly after PrP(C) depletion, supporting the concept that they are caused by a transient neurotoxic species, distinct from aggregated PrP(Sc). These data suggest that early intervention in human prion disease may lead to recovery of cognitive and behavioral symptoms.", "[The identification of viruses of human papilloma of high carcinogenic risk and evaluation of physical status of viral DNA using technique of polymerase-chain reaction under affection of cervical epithelium].\nThe DNA of virus of human papilloma of high carcinogenic risk was detected in 116 cervical samples. At that, the morphological symptoms of background processes are detected in 19 samples, CIN 1 in 9, CIN 2 in 23, CIN 3 in 54 (and out of them carcinoma in situ in 13), epidermoid cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) in 11 cases. The viral load of human papilloma of high carcinogenic risk in all samples of DNA exceeded threshold of clinical value (3 lg copies of DNA of human papilloma/105 cells). The genetic typing of human papilloma of high carcinogenic risk revealed the dominance of human papilloma of type 16 in 49.7%, type 33 in 15.3%, type 31 in 12.3% and type 45 in 5.5%. In women with background processes in cervix of the uterus DNA of human papilloma type 16 was detected more often in episome form. In case of dysplastic alterations of epithelium and cervical cancer DNA of human papilloma type 16 is detected in mixt form with different degree of integration into cell genome.", "[Preclinical lymph node metastasis in ovarian cancer. Report of a case].\nThe involvement of inguinal lymph nodes in the spread and metastatic process of ovarian cancer is not common and has been reported in a very small percentage of cases (1-3%) and at relatively advanced stages. This paper examines the case of a patient in whom lymph node metastasis at inguinal level became manifest at quite an early stage in the form of a swelling, initially mistaken for a crural hernia, and preceding by about one year the onset of papilliferous serous cystoadenocarcinoma which subsequently developed in the right ovary. This case, which to the authors' knowledge represents the second observation of this kind reported in the literature, aims to draw attention to the need to examine and monitor these patients more carefully and accurately (at both instrumental and biochemical levels) in order to intervene as rapidly and appropriately as possible.", "Management of patients with malignant bowel obstruction and stage IV colorectal cancer.\nMalignant bowel obstruction (MBO), a serious problem in stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, remains poorly understood. Optimal management requires realistic assessment of treatment goals. This study's purpose is to characterize outcomes following palliative intervention for MBO in the setting of metastatic CRC. Retrospective review of a prospective palliative database identified 141 patients undergoing surgical (OR; n = 96) or endoscopic (GI; n = 45) procedures for symptoms of MBO. Median patient age was 58 years, median follow-up 7 months. Most (63%) had multiple sites of metastases. Computed tomography (CT) scan findings of carcinomatosis (p = 0.002), ascites (p = 0.05), and multifocal obstruction with carcinomatosis and ascites (p = 0.03) significantly predicted the need for percutaneous or open gastrostomy tube, or stoma. Procedure-associated morbidity for 81 patients with small bowel obstruction (SBO) was 37%; 7% developed an enterocutaneous fistula/anastomotic leak. Thirty-day mortality was 6%. Most (84%) patients were palliated successfully; some received additional chemotherapy (38%) or surgery (12%). Procedure-associated morbidity for 60 patients with large bowel obstruction (LBO) was 25%; 11 patients (18%) required other procedures for stent failure, with one death at 30 days. Symptom resolution was >97%. Patients with LBO had improved symptom resolution, shorter length of stay (LOS), and longer median survival than patients with SBO. Patients with MBO and stage IV CRC were successfully palliated with GI or OR procedures. Patients with CT-identified ascites, carcinomatosis, or multifocal obstruction were least likely to benefit from OR procedures. CT plays an important role in preoperative planning. Sound clinical judgment and improved understanding are required for optimal management of MBO.", "GABA increases both the conductance and mean open time of recombinant GABAA channels co-expressed with GABARAP.\nThe single channel properties of recombinant gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A))alphabetagamma receptors co-expressed with the trafficking protein GABARAP were investigated using membrane patches in the outside-out patch clamp configuration from transiently transfected L929 cells. In control cells expressing alphabetagamma receptors alone, GABA activated single channels whose main conductance was 30 picosiemens (pS) with a subconductance state of 20 pS, and increasing the GABA concentration did not alter their conductance. In contrast, when GABA(A) receptors were co-expressed with GABARAP, the GABA-activated single channels displayed multiple, high conductances (> or =40 pS), and GABA (> or =10 microM) was able to increase their conductance, up to a maximum of 60 pS. The mean open time of GABA-activated channels in control cells expressing alphabetagamma receptors alone was 2.3 +/- 0.1 ms for the main 30-pS channel and shorter for the subconductance state (20 pS, 0.8 +/- 0.1 ms). Similar values were measured for the 30- and 20-pS channels active in patches from cells co-expressing GABARAP. However higher conductance channels (> or =40 pS) remained open longer, irrespective of whether GABA or GABA plus diazepam activated them. Plotting mean open times against mean conductances revealed a linear relationship between these two parameters. Since high GABA concentrations increase both the maximum single channel conductance and mean open time of GABA(A) channels co-expressed with GABARAP, trafficking processes must influence ion channel properties. This suggests that the organization of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors may provide a range of distinct inhibitory currents in the brain and, further, provide differential drug responses.", "Evaluating a problem-based empowerment program for African Americans with diabetes: results of a randomized controlled trial.\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of a problem-based empowerment patient education program specifically tailored for urban African Americans with type 2 diabetes. The study used a randomized controlled trial (RCT) pretest/post-test design with repeated measures. Patients were randomly assigned to either a six-week intervention group or a six-week wait-listed control group. After completing the six sessions, patients were invited to participate in one of two follow-up conditions; attend a monthly support group or receive a monthly phone call from a nurse. Assessment measures included HbA1C, lipids, blood pressure, weight, self-management behavior and psychosocial adaptation. Both control and intervention patients showed a broad array of small-to-modest positive changes during the six-week RCT. These gains were maintained or improved upon during the one-year follow-up period. For patients in the two follow-up conditions, a positive correlation was seen between the number of follow-up contacts and their one-year HbA1C values. We believe that results of this study can be attributed to volunteer bias, study effects (ie, providing study data on several occasions to patients and their physicians during the one-year study period), and impact of the interventions. However, the study design does not allow us to examine the relative impact of these three factors on the patient improvements seen over the one-year study period.", "Use of Joslin Vision Network digital-video nonmydriatic retinal imaging to assess diabetic retinopathy in a clinical program.\nTo incorporate a nonmydriatic, digital-video retinal imaging system into a Diabetes Outpatient Intensive Treatment Program and to evaluate the system's ability to assess diabetic retinopathy (DR), determine follow-up, and appropriately refer to retinal specialist ophthalmologists. Fundus images were obtained according to Joslin Vision Network (JVN) protocol and evaluated by certified JVN readers. Patients with significant retinal disease underwent evaluation by retinal specialists. A total of 268 (51.0%) of 525 imaged patients had comprehensive eye examination by a retinal specialist owing to referable JVN-assessed clinical level of DR, nondiabetic ocular disease, ungradeable images, last eye examination >/=12 months prior, or patient request for examination. JVN diagnosis of a clinical level of DR agreed exactly with clinical findings in 388 eyes (72.5%) or within one level in 478 eyes (89.3%). JVN referral based on most severe diagnosis in either eye matched retinal specialist-recommended follow-up in 248/268 of patients (92.5%). A total of 136/525 (25.9%) of JVN patients had nondiabetic ocular abnormalities requiring referral. Recommended follow-up from JVN imaging compared favorably to clinical examination by a retinal specialist. Nondiabetic ocular pathology was identified. JVN assessment of DR level compares favorably to clinical practice, potentially improving access to eye care and enhancing diabetes management.", "Bayesian estimation of survival functions under stochastic precedence.\nWhen estimating the distributions of two random variables, X and Y, investigators often have prior information that Y tends to be bigger than X. To formalize this prior belief, one could potentially assume stochastic ordering between X and Y, which implies Pr(X < or = z) > or = Pr(Y < or = z) for all z in the domain of X and Y. Stochastic ordering is quite restrictive, though, and this article focuses instead on Bayesian estimation of the distribution functions of X and Y under the weaker stochastic precedence constraint, Pr(X < or = Y) > or = 0.5. We consider the case where both X and Y are categorical variables with common support and develop a Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior computation. The method is then generalized to the case where X and Y are survival times. The proposed approach is illustrated using data on survival after tumor removal for patients with malignant melanoma.", "Hollow Fiber Liquid Based Microextraction of Nalidixic Acid in Urine Samples Using Aliquat 336 as a Carrier Combined with High-Performance Liquid Chromatography.\nA new and simple hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction was used in conjunction with HPLC for the extraction and quantitative determination of nalidixic acid (NA) in human urine samples. This study considers this technique an alternative to common methods of hollow fiber microextraction based on pH gradient and electromembrane extraction of NA in human urine samples. In this research, the drug was extracted from the source phase (donor phase) into a modified organic phase with Aliquat 336 (hydrophobic ion-pair reagent) as a carrier able to impregnate pores of the hollow fiber. In this study, the effects of several factors were tested on the extraction efficiency of the drug. Under optimum conditions, the linearity of the method was observed over the range 0.05-2.0 \u00b5g mL(-1) with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.9983. The results of tests on the method determined a good sensitivity with a limit of detection of 0.008 \u00b5g mL(-1). The intra-day relative standard deviation (n = 9) for 0.8 \u00b5g mL(-1) was 6.2%, and the inter-day relative standard deviation (n = 5) for 0.8 \u00b5g mL(-1) was 5.6%. This new strategy was successfully applied to analyze a real urine sample with satisfactory results.", "Integrative Indicator for Assessing the Alert Levels of Algal Bloom in Lakes: Lake Taihu as a Case Study.\nAlgal blooms have recently become one of the most serious environmental problems in eutrophic freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Although many observation and simulation approaches have been applied to predict algal blooms, few studies have addressed the alert levels of algal blooms using integrative indicators in a large lake with multiple service function and significant horizontal heterogeneity. This study developed an integrative indicator assessment system (IIAS) to rank the alert level of algal blooms. In the IIAS, algal biomass, area percentage, distance from drinking water intake points, distance from scenic zones and duration of algal bloom were used as indicators to calculate a comprehensive alert level, which was classified into five grades (Vigilance, Low, Moderate, High, and Severe). Lake Taihu was taken as a case study to assess the comprehensive alert level of algal blooms in 2007 and 2010. The comprehensive alert level showed obvious spatial-temporal patterns, with an acceptable accuracy in Lake Taihu. The comprehensive alert levels were relatively higher in typical phytoplankton subzones than typical hydrophytes subzones and are more sensitive to weight factor in the northern and western subzones where high biomass usually occurs. Case study showed a very good application of the proposed comprehensive alert level assessment methodology, which can be adjusted to predict the degree of hazard of algal blooms in multi-service function large lakes to help the government and decision makers to act to prevent the disaster from algal bloom spreading.", "AS2762900-00, a potent anti-human IL-23 receptor monoclonal antibody, prevents epidermal hyperplasia in a psoriatic human skin xenograft model.\nInterleukin (IL)-23 is thought to be critical in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, and anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been approved for the treatment of psoriasis. We speculated that an anti-IL-23 receptor mAb might have greater efficacy than an anti-IL-23 mAb in the treatment of local inflamed lesions with high IL-23 levels. We previously generated an anti-human IL-23 receptor mAb, AS2762900-00, which potently blocked IL-23-induced cell proliferation, regardless of the concentration of IL-23. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of AS2762900-00 in the treatment of psoriasis. Compared with untreated control, AS2762900-00 significantly reduced the epidermal thickness of lesions in a clinically relevant psoriatic human skin xenograft model. The expression of inflammatory genes including genes downstream of IL-23 signaling in the lesion tended to be lower in the AS2762900-00 group than the untreated group, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of AS2762900-00 in the psoriatic human skin xenograft model might occur via blockade of IL-23 signaling pathways. Further, AS2762900-00 showed an inhibitory effect on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation as a downstream signal of IL-23 receptor activation in whole blood from patients with psoriasis. We also confirmed that AS2762900-00 inhibited IL-23-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner using whole blood from healthy donors. These data suggest that AS2762900-00 is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of psoriasis. In addition, STAT3 phosphorylation in whole blood may be a useful biomarker for the evaluation of the pharmacodynamic effects of AS2762900-00 in healthy volunteers in clinical development.", "Discordant expression of 2 Epstein-Barr virus-associated antigens, EBNA and RANA, in man-rodent somatic cell hybrids.\nThe Epstein Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) and the rheumatoid arthritis nuclear antigen (RANA) develop in human B lymphocytes that have been infected and transformed by Epstein Barr virus (EBV). Antibodies to RANA and EBNA are found only in individuals with prior exposure to EBV. The purpose of the present studies was to determine the relation of the 2 antigens to each other and to EBV genetic material, in human-rodent somatic cell hybrids. Cultured human B lymphoblastoid cells, Raji, Daudi, and RPMI 4098 were fused with thymidine kinase-deficient mouse or hamster fibroblasts. After selection and cloning in ouabain-HAT medium, the hybrid nature of the surviving cells was confirmed by isozyme analysis. The hybrid clones were analyzed for EBNA by anti-complement im,munofluorescence, and for RANA by anti-immunoglobulin immunofluorescence and immunodiffusion. The results showed that RANA and EBNA segregated entirely independently of each other in the hybrid clones. Two methods were used to detect the presence of EBV DNA sequences in the intracellular DNA of hybrid clones. The 1st method relied on the hybridization of labeled cRNA prepared from virion DNA with DNA from 8 hybrid clones affixed to nitrocellulose filters. The 2nd approach was to hybridize labeled intracellular DNA from 3 hybrid clones to Southern blots of cloned fragments of EBV DNA. These results suggested that the presence of EBV DNA was not sufficient for the expression of either antigen. One stable RANA-positive hybrid cell line contained at least 80% of the EBV genome in the absence of detectable EBNA.", "Comparison of mortality in patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease following the first vascular intervention.\nPatients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) less frequently achieve secondary prevention goals compared with patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We aimed to compare mortality rates in patients with PAD and CAD following first vascular intervention. Patients 18 years of age or older without a history of cardiovascular disease, who underwent first coronary or lower limb vascular intervention between 2002 and 2010, were included in this study. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Of the 9950 participants, 8242 (82.8%) underwent first coronary revascularization and 1708 (17.2%) received first peripheral vascular intervention. During a mean follow-up period of 5.6\u00b12.3 years, 1283 (12.9%) participants died. Compared with CAD patients, patients with PAD had significantly worse long-term prognosis with an increased risk for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio=2.95, 95% confidence interval 2.6-3.3, P<0.0001). This association remained statistically significant following a multivariable analysis (hazard ratio=1.86, 95% confidence interval 1.6-2.1, P<0.0001). Furthermore, PAD patients were less frequently treated with cardioprotective medications including statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, aspirin, and clopidogrel (P<0.001). Patients with PAD have worse outcome compared with patients with CAD, even in the specific group of patients following first vascular intervention. These findings demand more effort to improve secondary prevention guidelines in all patients with cardiovascular diseases, but especially in PAD patients.", "As both men and mice age, their immune systems lose their ability to function normally. My first objective is to find out in mice how much of that loss is intrinsically timed within lymphoid stem cell lines and lymphoid organ microenvironments; and how much immunologic activity is lost because it cannot be adequately supported in the aged mouse's deficient internal environment. To answer these questions, lymphoid stem cell lines and intact lymphoid organs are transplanted from old mice (and from young adult controls) into histocompatible young recipients. The ability of these transplants to perform immunologic functions is tested rigorously in systems where the transplants are clearly identified. My second objective is to determine whether aging of the immune response allows more cancers to develop. Cancers that develop spontaneously with increased incidences in aging mice will be tested to determine how strongly they stimulate immune responses against themselves. Cancers from older mice will tend to stimulate stronger immune responses if immunological loss with age has allowed tumors to grow that younger mice would have rejected. My third objective is to rejuvenate immune responses in old mice. Young stem cell lines and intact young lymphoid organs will be transplanted into old mice; young mice will be parabiosed to old mice by joining their skins, and chromosome markers will identify old and young cells. Immune functions and other parameters that change with age will be followed. Life span and pathology at death will be compared between the old mice that we attempt to rejuvenate, and matched untreated old controls.", "Endovascular aortic crossclamp: a novel way to reduce warm ischemia time in DCD donors.\nStrategies like donation after cardiac death (DCD) have become more widely accepted to increase potential organ supply and decrease waiting list time. Warm ischemia time (WIT) is a key prognostic factor for organ function. Any process that can decrease WIT could decrease the number of discarded organs as well as improve graft and patient survival. A novel endovascular aortic crossclamping technique in DCD donors is described. Six kidneys and two livers were recovered from three donors. Mean WIT from extubation to aortic crossclamp was 25 +/- 8 minutes. Time from initial glidewire placement to crossclamp was less than 2 minutes. All the organs were adequately flushed; back table examination confirmed clean venous effluent and no signs of thrombosis. Four kidneys were transplanted. Two kidneys were discarded after DCD was prolonged and WIT was 60 minutes. The two livers were not allocated. The WIT can be manipulated after cardiac activity has stopped. The endovascular crossclamp is a novel and feasible technique that can decrease WIT after cardiac death by reducing the surgical time to aortic crossclamp.", "Risk of suicide among persons with AIDS. A national assessment.\nWe sought to describe the rate, risk, trends, methods, and distribution of suicide among persons with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States. We used National Center for Health Statistics multiple-cause mortality data from 1987 through 1989 to identify suicides among persons with AIDS (PWAs) and public-access AIDS surveillance data to determine person-years of observation of PWAs. Residents of the United States with death certificates indicating suicide. Death certificates indicating both AIDS and suicide. In 1987 through 1989, a total of 165 suicides among PWAs occurred in 45 states and the District of Columbia. All but one case were male. Among males the rate was 165 per 100,000 person-years of observation, 7.4-fold higher than among demographically similar men in the general population. Self-poisoning with drugs was both the most common method (35%) and the method with the highest standardized mortality ratio (35). Suicide risk for PWAs decreased significantly (P < .05) from 1987 to 1989. Persons with AIDS have an increased risk of suicide, and assessment of such risk should be a standard practice in their care. These assessments should be carefully considered when potentially lethal medications are prescribed. The declining trend in suicide rates between 1987 and 1989 is encouraging; possible causes include emerging therapies for human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS, better psychiatric care for these patients, and lessened social stigma against PWAs.", "Creating a continent tubeless gastrostomy.\nStandard tube feeding gastrostomy is associated with a myriad of problems among which leakage of gastric contents is the most serious. Over the years many methods of creating tubeless gastrostomy have been unsuccessful because of the extent of surgery required and the persistent leakage of gastric fluids. By using gastrointestinal staplers to create a gastric tube and by incorporating a reverse intussusception valve at its base, we created a continent tubeless feeding gastrostomy in 23 patients aged 10 to 81 years. Eight had head injuries, 12 had cerebrovascular strokes, and 3 had head and neck disorders leading to aphagopraxia. Twelve of the procedures were performed with local anesthesia and the remainder with general anesthesia. The GIA stapler was used to create a 5 cm gastric tube after which circumferential stitches were placed to intussuscept 2 cm of the tube into the stomach to create a valve. A 1 cm stoma was created at skin level. Operative time was 47 to 90 minutes and there were no operative deaths or complications. Stomal necrosis occurred in two patients so they were converted to a standard tube gastrostomy by leaving a Foley catheter in place. After 16 months of follow-up, one stricture developed at 4 months and two were electively closed under local anesthesia. None is incontinent. The tubeless continent feeding gastrostomy is convenient for both patients and nursing staff and should replace the standard feeding gastrostomy when long-term nutritional support is needed.", "Diabetic muscle infarction in end-stage renal disease.\nDiabetic muscle infarction (DMI) is an unusual disorder of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients with advanced microvascular damage including nephropathy. Few reports describe this complication among dialysis patients. We studied four patients with terminal renal failure due to diabetic nephropathy who developed isolated skeletal muscle infarction at our institution between January 1998 and January 2003, and reviewed 15 additional cases of DMI reported among dialysis patients (Medline database search). Analysis of available data for all 19 cases revealed the following features: mean age at symptom onset of 46.4 years; average duration of renal replacement 25.7 months (range 36 h to 72 months); male predominance (2.2:1); higher prevalence of type 2 vs type 1 diabetes (2.2:1); and more common use of haemodialysis than peritoneal dialysis (2.6:1). One patient developed symptoms after being immobilized during surgery and initiating dialysis. Thigh involvement was frequent (17/19). Fever, leucocytosis and elevated serum creatine kinase levels were noted inconsistently, but were seen commonly with early evaluation after symptom onset. Erythrocyte-sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels were high when checked. All 16 instances of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated increased T2-weighted signal from affected muscles. Seven patients were managed without muscle biopsy. Histological features included myofibre necrosis (8/12), inflammatory infiltrates (8/12) and microvasculopathy (6/12). Symptoms resolved with conservative therapy, but patients were at high risk for subsequent infarctions of other muscles (14/19). DMI should be suspected in any diabetic dialysis patient who develops a painful, swollen muscle. A conservative MRI-based diagnostic approach may lead to satisfactory outcomes. The pathogenesis of the disorder is controversial, but the clinical sequence of one of our cases suggests precipitation by immobilization, direct pressure and/or haemoconcentration.", "Feeding and pecking behaviour in ostrich (Struthio camelus) chicks in captivity.\n1. Three sets of experiments were performed on two batches of ostrich chicks to investigate the factors affecting the pecking and feeding behaviour of grouped individuals. 2. Chicks showed no significant alteration of their feeding behaviour in response to raising pen walls in the rearing facility from 30 to 60 cm. 3. Further analysis on a different set of birds revealed consistent short term individual differences in the frequency of feeding and non-feeding pecks. 4. There were significant pen effects on behaviour suggesting the possible development of a pen 'culture' of pecking behaviour. 5. Pecking behaviours in 26 to 33 d-old chicks, with the exception of drinking, were generally negatively correlated, so any non-food pecking by a chick was generally associated with fewer pecks targeted at food. 6. By the age of two months chicks were pecking at food on the floor to a far greater extent than at any food presented in food trays.", "Comparison of measured and calculated dose rates in water near I-125 and Ir-192 seeds.\nRecent theoretical and experimental work indicates that currently accepted 125I dosimetry data may overestimate dose in water at 1 cm by 10%-24%. Among the most comprehensive measurements are those of the NCI-sponsored brachytherapy contract participants. Absolute dose rates in water calculated by the Monte Carlo method have been compared with the NCI dose measurements about 125I and 192Ir seeds embedded in solid-water phantoms. The photon transport code allows realistic geometric simulation of the complex internal seed structure, the National Institute of Standards and Technology air-kerma strength standardization geometry, and the dose measurement setup. When the appropriate measurement medium and geometry are assumed, agreement between theory and measurement is excellent, within 3% at 1 cm and averaging 3% at larger distances. However, the data do not support the water equivalence of solid water at 125I energies indicating that solid-water measurements underestimate 125I specific dose-rate constants in water by 4.3%. Because of its higher ratio of absorption to scatter, 125I dose distributions measured in solid water are less penetrating (by 35% at 10 cm) than those measured in liquid water. For model 6711, model 6702, and steel-clad 192Ir seeds, Monte Carlo calculations yielded specific dose-rate constants (assuming liquid water medium) of 0.877, 0.932, and 1.122 cGy cm2 h-1 per unit air-kerma strength, respectively. For 125I, currently accepted values are 18% and 11% larger for the two seed models.", "Chaperonopathies by defect, excess, or mistake.\nThe stress response, stress proteins, heat-shock genes and proteins, molecular chaperone genes and proteins, and a number of closely related molecules and cellular processes have been studied over the last few decades. A huge amount of information has accumulated that is scattered in printed and electronic literature and databases. Most of this information constitutes the subject matter of the science of chaperonology. More recently, the concept of chaperone pathology, sick chaperones, has evolved since various pathological conditions have been identified in which defective chaperones play an etiologic role. These conditions are the chaperonopathies. Recent findings on chaperonopathies are briefly discussed in this article. Chaperonopathies occur at all ages; as a rule the genetic cases have an early clinical onset while the acquired chaperonopathies become manifest in the elderly and/or in association with other diseases. Other fields of chaperonology, which will most likely be expanded in the near future, are the study of extracellular chaperones, chaperone networks, the therapeutic use of chaperones (i.e., chaperonotherapy) to manage chaperonopathies and to improve cell performance in the face of stress, the evaluation of chaperones as diagnostic markers and as prognostic indicators, and the development of antichaperone agents to suppress chaperone-gene expression or inhibit chaperone function when chaperones contribute to disease rather than the opposite.", "WASP-ASSOCIATED FACTORS ACT IN INTERSPECIES COMPETITION DURING MULTIPARASITISM.\nCoexistence or displacement of parasitoids in hosts during intrinsic competitive interactions between different parasitoid species (multiparasitism) may depend on their life history traits and behavior. Intense competition for possession of hosts may lead to the elimination of the inferior competitor through physical attack and/or physiological suppression. However, the mechanisms of physiological suppression during multiparasitism remain unclear. Previous work has shown that first instar larvae of the solitary endoparasitoid Meteorus pulchricornis possess well-developed mandibles that are used to kill competitors. Two gregarious endoparasitoids, Cotesia kariyai and C. rufricus, share host resources especially when the time gap of oviposition is short. Here, we investigated the physiological influence of wasp-regulatory factors of the three endoparasitoids, M. pulchricornis, C. kariyai, and C. ruficrus, in their common host Mythimna separata. We found that MpVLP alone (or with venom) deleteriously affected the development of the two gregarious species. Similarly, CkPDV plus venom had toxic effect on M. pulchricornis eggs and immature larvae, although they were not harmful to immature stages of C. ruficrus. Cotesia kariyai and C. ruficrus were able to coexist mainly through the expression of regulatory factors and both could successfully emerge from a multiparasitized host. The injection of CkPDV plus venom after oviposition in L5 host larvae facilitated C. ruficrus development and increased the rate of successful parasitism from 9% to 62%. This suggests that the two gregarious parasitoid wasps exhibit strong phylogenetic affinity, favoring their coexistence and success in multiparasitized hosts.", "Fast immunopurification of small amounts of specific antibodies on peptides bound to ELISA plates.\nELISA is widely used as a means to detect antibodies, but the potential of ELISA plates as an immunosorbent for the purification of specific antibodies does not seem to have been evaluated. In this study, ELISA plates coated with peptides representing short sequences of various antigens from Plasmodium falciparum, the etiologic agent of human malaria, have been successfully used as a means to purify small amounts of the corresponding antibodies. ELISA plates, identical to those used for antibody detection, also permitted the evaluation of various elution conditions for each pairing of peptide and serum; we tested four eluting buffers (0.2 M glycine, pH 2.5; 0.2 M lysine, pH 11.5; 3.0 M MgCl2, 0.075 M Hepes, 25% ethylene glycol, pH 7.1-7.2 and 4 M NH4SCN in 0.1 M NaH2PO4, pH 6.0) with four pairs of peptides and sera. The ELISA plates could also be used to estimate the affinity of the eluted antibodies by the technique of Pullen et al. (1986). The eluted antibodies were compared to those obtained by immunopurification on recombinant proteins adsorbed on nitrocellulose filters. In contrast to the latter, they were not contaminated by antibodies directed against the carrier moiety of the recombinant protein. When used in immunofluorescence assays with various stages of the parasite the antibodies immunopurified on peptides bound to ELISA plates were able to react with the native antigens in the parasite.", "The concept of mesenchymal stem cells.\nIn this chapter we examine whether criteria usually defining adult tissue stem cells apply to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that give rise to cells of the skeletal connective tissues. MSCs appear to constitute a heterogeneous population of undifferentiated and committed, lineage-primed cells, capable of: homing upon engraftment to a number of growth microenvironments, extensive proliferation, producing large numbers of differentiated progeny, and functional tissue repair after injury. In addition, MSCs are extensively distributed throughout tissues, and bone marrow MSCs provide the stromal component of the niche of hematopoietic stem cells. The capacity of apparently differentiated mesenchymal cells to shift their differentiation pathway with changing microenvironmental conditions (known as differentiation plasticity) may be due to de-differentiation and reprogramming in MSCs. Because they present several features setting them apart from other stem cells, MSCs may constitute another paradigm for stem cell systems, where self-renewal and hierarchy are no longer essential, but where plasticity is the major characteristic.", "A new type of transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction.\nExamination of spontaneous miniature endplate potentials (MEPPs) in murine skeletal muscle has revealed that in conditions such as botulinum poisoning, during nerve terminal regeneration or in the presence of the drug 4-aminoquinoline, two types of acetylcholine release are responsible for the MEPPs. In addition to the MEPPs which correspond to the quantal component of a nerve impulse-evoked endplate potential a second type of acetylcholine release occurs. The latter type of transmitter release gives rise to MEPPs with a more prolonged time-to-peak and frequently a larger than normal amplitude. It is unaffected by nerve terminal depolarization and transmembrane Ca2+ fluxes. The relationship between MEPP frequency and temperature has a Q10 of about 12 compared to 2-3 for normal MEPPs. In botulinum-poisoned muscles this secretory type of transmitter release dominates, being exclusively present in muscles where nerve stimulation fails to release transmitter. In normal muscle such a release is induced by 4-aminoquinoline which may cause up to 45% of all the spontaneous MEPPs to be of that kind. It is suggested that the described spontaneous secretion of acetylcholine serves in inductory and neurotrophic function.", "Optimizing the dose of intrathecal morphine in older patients undergoing hip arthroplasty.\nIntrathecal (IT) morphine provides excellent postoperative analgesia but may result in many side effects, including postoperative nausea and vomiting, pruritus, and respiratory depression, particularly at larger doses. Older patients may be at particular risk. The optimal dose of spinal morphine in older patients undergoing hip arthroplasty is not known. We designed this prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded study to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and side effect profile of 50-200 microg of IT morphine in older patients undergoing elective hip arthroplasty. Sixty patients older than 65 years undergoing elective hip arthroplasty were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive spinal anesthesia with 15 mg of bupivacaine and IT morphine in four groups: 1). 0 microg, 2). 50 microg, 3). 100 microg, and 4). 200 microg. IT morphine 100 and 200 microg produced effective pain relief and decreased the postoperative requirement for morphine compared with control. IT morphine 50 microg did not provide effective pain relief. Both 100 and 200 microg of IT morphine provided comparable levels of postoperative analgesia. There were no between-group differences in postoperative nausea and vomiting, sedation, respiratory depression, or urinary retention. Pruritus was significantly more frequent with 200 microg of IT morphine. In conclusion, 100 microg of IT morphine provided the best balance between analgesic efficacy and side effect profile in older patients undergoing hip arthroplasty. The dosage of intrathecal morphine that provides the best balance between analgesic efficacy and side effect profile in the older patient undergoing hip arthroplasty is not known. This prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded clinical trial demonstrates that a dose of 100 microg of intrathecal morphine provides the best balance between efficacy and side effects, compared with doses of 0, 50, and 200 microg of morphine, in this patient population.", "Transplant immunosuppression increases and prolongs transgene expression following adenoviral-mediated transfection of rat lungs.\nGene therapy provides the potential to modify donor organs to better withstand transplantation, but this has yet to be realized. In vivo gene transfer using adenoviral vectors has had limited success because of host immune response that induces inflammation and limits the amount and duration of transgene expression. We hypothesize that transplantation immunosuppression can attenuate the post-transfection host-immune response to allow for improved gene transfer following adenoviral-mediated transfection. We intratracheally transfected with adenovirus containing the beta-galactosidase gene and randomized the rats to either the immunosuppression group, receiving daily cyclosporine, azathioprine, and methylprednisolone, or the control group, receiving no immunosuppression. We evaluated transgene expression and post-transfection inflammation at time points ranging from 1 day to 5 weeks. Following transfection, control rats showed relatively low levels of transgene expression, which rapidly decreased to non-detectable levels. In contrast, immunosuppressed rats demonstrated significantly higher levels of transgene expression overall (p < 0.00005), peaking at almost 3 times that of the control group (p < 0.02), and showing prolonged and elevated transgene expression at 5 weeks (p < 0.02). On histologic sections of the lungs, immunosuppressed rats exhibited overall lesser grades of post-transfection inflammation. Transplant immunosuppression provides the means to attenuate the severe immune response to adenoviral-mediated gene transfection and thereby increase and prolong transgene expression.", "A brief update on physical and optical disector applications and sectioning-staining methods in neuroscience.\nA quantitative description of a three-dimensional (3D) object based on two-dimensional images can be made using stereological methods These methods involve unbiased approaches and provide reliable results with quantitative data. The quantitative morphology of the nervous system has been thoroughly researched in this context. In particular, various novel methods such as design-based stereological approaches have been applied in neuoromorphological studies. The main foundations of these methods are systematic random sampling and a 3D approach to structures such as tissues and organs. One key point in these methods is that selected samples should represent the entire structure. Quantification of neurons, i.e. particles, is important for revealing degrees of neurodegeneration and regeneration in an organ or system. One of the most crucial morphometric parameters in biological studies is thus the \"number\". The disector counting method introduced by Sterio in 1984 is an efficient and reliable solution for particle number estimation. In order to obtain precise results by means of stereological analysis, counting items should be seen clearly in the tissue. If an item in the tissue cannot be seen, these cannot be analyzed even using unbiased stereological techniques. Staining and sectioning processes therefore play a critical role in stereological analysis. The purpose of this review is to evaluate current neuroscientific studies using optical and physical disector counting methods and to discuss their definitions and methodological characteristics. Although the efficiency of the optical disector method in light microscopic studies has been revealed in recent years, the physical disector method is more easily performed in electron microscopic studies. Also, we offered to readers summaries of some common basic staining and sectioning methods, which can be used for stereological techniques in this review.", "[AFLP analysis on genetic diversity of Haloxylon ammodendron in China].\nTo determine the genetic diversity of Haloxylon ammodendron collected from 14 sites in 5 provinces, 103 H. ammodendron samples of 12 wild populations and 2 cultivated which collected from 14 sites in 5 provinces were analyzed by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) DNA markers. PopGen32 and NTSYSpc2.1 was applied to evaluate genetic diversity of H. ammodendron populations. The average percentage of polymorphic loci (PPL) of total H. ammodendron populations was 94.13%, the average Nei's gene diversity index (H(e)) from 14 populations was 0.308 0, and the Shannon's genetic diversity index (I) was 0.467 6. The results indicated that the genetic diversity of H. ammodendron populations was high. Genetic differentiation index (G(st)) was 0.313 8, and the gene flow (N(m)) was 1.093 5 at the population level. The level of gene flow of H. ammodendron showed it possessed the feature of wind-pollinated outcrossing plants. AMOVA analysis indicated that genetic variation of H. ammodendron was much higher within groups (89.34%) than that among groups (10.66%), moreover genetic variation within groups mainly occurred among populations in different producing areas (84.80%). Cluster analysis (UPGMA) was applied to generate dendrogram based on Nei's genetic distances of 14 populations. Samples from Xinjiang and Qinghai were clustered respectively as a clade for their distant genetic relationship, while Samples from Gansu, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia were clustered together for their close genetic relationship. Genetic diversity of H. ammodendron populations is high in China, and genetic differentiation among regions is small, thus abundance within this specie is high at this stage. Therefore, wild nursery and artificial cultivating in different areas are effective measures for the conservation and sustainable utilization of H. ammodendron resources.", "Waveform complexity: A new metric for EEG analysis.\nEEG represents a cost-effective mechanism to evaluate brain function. To realize its potential, it is essential to identify aspects of the signal that provide insight into differences in cognitive, emotional and behavioral outcomes and can therefore aid in diagnostic measurement. Here we define a new metric of the EEG signal that assesses the diversity of waveform shapes in the signal. The metric, which we term waveform complexity, abbreviated as Cw, compares the similarity of the shape of waveforms of long durations by computing the correlation (r) of segments. A distribution of waveform diversity is computed as 1-|r|x100, from which Cw is obtained as the median. We identify the length parameter that provides the maximal variance in Cw across the sample population and therefore greatest potential discriminatory power. We also provide insight into the impact of various manipulations of the signal such as sampling rate, filtering, phase shuffling and signal duration. Finally, as a test of potential application, we demonstrate that when applied to eyes closed EEG recordings in subjects taken immediately prior to taking a Raven's progressive matrix test, this measure had a high correlation to participant's scores. Cw, while correlated with other similar measures such as spectral entropy, sample entropy and Lempel-Ziv complexity, significantly outperformed these measures in its correlation to participants' task scores. This waveform complexity measure warrants further investigation as a potential measure of cognitive and other brain states.", "The use of 13C nuclear magnetic resonance of aromatic amino acid residues to determine the midpoint oxidation-reduction potential of each iron-sulfur cluster of Clostridium acidi-urici and Clostridium pasteurianum ferredoxins.\n13C NMR of the aromatic residues of Clostridium acidi-urici [Phe2]ferredoxin (a chemically modified ferredoxin in which a phenylalanyl residue replaces a tyrosyl residue) and Clostridium pasteurianum ferredoxin permits one to distinguish and probe each iron-sulfur (Fe7S7) cluster neighboring the aromatic residues within each protein. This is because the ring carbon resonance shifts of the phenylalanyl and tyrosyl residues can be distinguished. The 13C NMR results suggest that the midpoint oxidation-reduction potentials of the two Fe4S4 clusters in C. pasteurianum and C. acidi-urici ferredoxin differ by 10 plus or minus 5 mv and smaller than mv, respectively. 13C NMR of an equilibrium mixture of methyl viologen-reduced C. acidi-urici and C. pasteurianum ferredoxin shows that the protein midpoint oxidation-reduction potential of C. acidi-urici ferredoxin is 47 plus or minus 10 mv lower than that of C. pasteurianum ferredoxin. We attribute the differences in cluster and protein midpoint oxidation-reduction potentials to differences in protein structure.", "Regulation of heterogeneity in D2 dopamine receptor gene expression among individual melanotropes in the rat pituitary intermediate lobe.\nThe regulation of D2 dopamine receptor binding, immunoreactivity, and mRNA was studied in melanotropes of the intermediate lobe of the rat pituitary. D2 dopamine receptor-binding experiments showed that chronic haloperidol treatment (2 mg/kg for 14 days) significantly increased the Bmax but not Kd of [3H]spiperone binding, whereas bromocriptine treatment (2 mg/kg for 14 days) produced no change in either parameter. Immunohistochemical experiments revealed that all melanotropes contained D2 receptor immunoreactivity but the D2long receptor isoform was intensely expressed by comparatively few melanotropes scattered among cells that contained substantially lower staining intensities. Chronic haloperidol treatment increased the overall intensity of total D2 receptor staining and concurrently increased both the number and staining intensity of melanotropes immunoreactive for the D2long isoform. Bromocriptine treatment produced no change in overall staining intensity; however, the number of melanotropes staining for the D2long isoform increased significantly. Nonradioactive in situ hybridization histochemistry further revealed that individual melanotropes contained differing amounts of both total D2 receptor and D2long mRNAs; the heterogeneity in D2long receptor expression was particularly striking. Following haloperidol treatment, D2 receptor mRNA levels increased in all melanotropes. Following bromocriptine treatment most melanotropes contained very low levels although many melanotropes retained substantial amounts of D2 receptor mRNA. The parallel increase in D2 receptor-binding densities, immunoreactivity, and mRNA levels following chronic antagonist treatment emulates the classic paradigm by which a cell increases its receptor population. Chronic agonist treatment did not follow the inverse paradigm and revealed heterogeneous regulation of a discrete subpopulation of melanotropes.", "Inherited susceptibility of cattle to high-altitude pulmonary hypertension.\nThis study examines the hypothesis that susceptibility of cattle to high-altitude pulmonary hypertension and heart failure (high mountain disease) is genetically transmitted. Eight offspring of cattle recovered from high mountain disease were considered \"susceptible.\" Eleven offspring of healthy cattle residing at high altitude were considered \"resistant.\" At the resident altitude of 1,524 m, 10-day-old susceptible calves had higher pulmonary arterial pressures than did resistant calves (34 vs.21 mmHg), but at 90 days of age the pressures for the two groups were similar (26 vs. 24 mmHg). After 64 days of exposure to an altitude of 3,048 m, the susceptible calves (87 +/- 7 (SE) vs. 40 +/- 3 mmHg). By 124 days at 3,048 m, all susceptible but none of the resistant calves had developed heart failure. The results indicated that susceptibility to pulmonary hypertension at high altitude was inherited. Susceptible cattle may provide a useful model of human hypoxic pulmonary hypertension.", "Suppression of hepatitis B virus core promoter by the nuclear orphan receptor TR4.\nThe TR4 orphan receptor is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that modulates gene expression via binding to the AGGTCA direct repeat hormone response element. Here we report a functional study of TR4 interaction with the core promoter of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay shows that TR4 can bind to the direct repeat 1 sequence element (AGGTTAAAGGTCT, nucleotide coordinates 1757-1769, TR4RE-HBV) on the HBV core promoter. TR4 also can enhance the activity of a synthetic luciferase reporter linked with four copies of TR4RE-HBV in either liver HepG2 or non-liver H1299 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, TR4 represses the activity of a luciferase reporter containing the entire HBV genome sequences. Moreover, mutation of this TR4RE-HBV site in the HBV core promoter diminishes the TR4 suppression effect. This TR4-induced suppression of HBV core promoter activity is further confirmed by primer extension analysis of the HBV core RNAs, showing that TR4 represses both pre-core and core mRNAs. Further dissection of this repressive mechanism indicates that TR4 may suppress the HBV core promoter activity via repressing HNF4alpha-mediated transactivation by protein-protein interactions without inhibition of HNF4alpha DNA binding. Furthermore, our results indicate that the N- and C-terminal regions of TR4 protein are required for TR4-HNF4alpha interaction. It is possible that TR4-HNF4alpha interaction may block the HNF4alpha function that results in the suppression of HBV gene expression. Together, these results demonstrate that TR4 can serve as a negative modulator in the transcriptional regulation of HBV core gene expression.", "[Surveillance of arteriovenous fistula: new answers to an old problem].\nArteriovenous fistula (AVF) surveillance is pivotal to early detection of stenosis, in order to avoid subsequent thrombosis. Access flow measurement is the method recommended by the available guidelines. With respect to grafts, in native AVF the best thresholds of access flow intervention, optimal timing of monitoring and cost-effectiveness are still debated. In fact, monthly measurement of access flow is difficult to obtain in most modern hemodialysis units. Moreover, in native AVF it is not always possible to perform the gold-standard surveillance methods. Finally, clinical evaluation is not enough to identify the small number of patients at risk of stenosis. The QB stress test (QBST) is a new and simple screening test that was created to identify inflow stenosis and thereby malfunctioning AVF. QBST shows a good correlation with access flow measurements obtained by the ultrasound dilution technique. Moreover, the test can be performed in every type of native AVF. Patients with a positive QBST result had a lower access flow than patients with a negative QBST result (433+-203 vs 1168+-681 mL/min, p<0.0001). The positive predictive value for inflow stenosis was 76.3%. During a 22-month followup, we were able to achieve a low thrombosis rate (1.5 instances of thrombosis per 100 patient-years). In conclusion, adding QBST to the clinical evaluation could offer a new solution for the long-standing AVF surveillance problem.", "Role of particle beam therapy in a trimodality approach to locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.\nLung cancer accounts for nearly one-fifth of all cancer deaths worldwide and is the most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Outcomes for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer remain extremely poor with regards to both local control and overall survival. Modest gains in local control were obtained with the incorporation of multimodality treatment, including preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgical resection; combination chemoradiotherapy also improved survival, secondary to improved local control. While the natural progression to trimodality therapy resulted in superior local control, it did not translate to improved overall survival, secondary to increased toxicity. The additional morbidity is likely from radiation toxicity, the minimization of which will be crucial to the future success of trimodality therapy. One strategy to decrease toxicity is to utilize charged particles, such as protons, which deposit a high dose at the Bragg peak with a minimal dose beyond the peak, thereby reducing the dose to distal normal tissues. Trimodality therapy incorporating preoperative proton radiation therapy and chemotherapy, followed by surgery, is currently being evaluated as a potential strategy to achieve improved local control and overall survival in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.", "Oxidative stress levels are correlated with P15 and P16 gene promoter methylation in myelodysplastic syndrome patients.\nOxidative stress and abnormal DNA methylation have been implicated in some types of cancer, namely in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Since both mechanisms are observed in MDS patients, we analyzed the correlation of intracellular levels of peroxides, superoxide anion, and glutathione (GSH), as well as ratios of peroxides/GSH and superoxide/GSH, with the methylation status of P15 and P16 gene promoters in bone marrow leukocytes from MDS patients. Compared to controls, these patients had lower GSH content, higher peroxide levels, peroxides/GSH and superoxide/GSH ratios, as well as higher methylation frequency of P15 and P16 gene promoters. Moreover, patients with methylated P15 gene had higher oxidative stress levels than patients without methylation (peroxides: 460 \u00b1 42 MIF vs 229 \u00b1 25 MIF, p = 0.001; superoxide: 383 \u00b1 48 MIF vs 243 \u00b1 17 MIF, p = 0.022; peroxides/GSH: 2.50 \u00b1 0.08 vs 1.04 \u00b1 0.34, p < 0.001; superoxide/GSH: 1.76 \u00b1 0.21 vs 1.31 \u00b1 0.10, p = 0.007). Patients with methylated P16 and at least one methylated gene had higher peroxide levels as well as peroxides/GSH ratio than patients without methylation. Interestingly, oxidative stress levels allow the discrimination of patients without methylation from ones with methylated P15, methylated P16, or at least one methylated (P15 or P16) promoter. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that oxidative stress is correlated with P15 and P16 hypermethylation.", "Synthesis, chemical characterization, computational studies and biological activity of new DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) specific inhibitor. Epigenetic regulation as a new and potential approach to cancer therapy.\nThis work deals with the synthesis, the chemical characterization of dibutyltin(IV) complex of caffeic acid (Bu2Sn(IV)HCAF, caf1) and its cytotoxic action on tumor cells. The coordination environment at the tin center was investigated by FTIR, (119)Sn{(1)H} cross polarization magic angle spinning, electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy in the solid state and UV-vis, fluorescence and (1)H, (13)C and (119)Sn NMR spectroscopy in solution phases. Density functional theory study confirmed the proposed structures in solution phase and indicated the most probably stable conformation. The effects on viability of breast cancer MDA-MB231, colorectal cancer HCT116, hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 and Chang liver cells, an immortalized non-tumor hepatic cell line, have been investigated. The effect of a variation in structure of caf1 was found to lead to a change in the respective antiproliferative properties: caf1 induces loss of viability in HCT116, MDA-MB-231, and HepG2; the complex shows only moderate effects in non-tumor Chang liver cells. caf1 exerts lower cytotoxic activity than Bu2SnCl2, suggesting that the binding with H3CAF modulates the marked cytotoxic activity exerted by Bu2SnCl2; caf1 displays a considerably more pronounced antitumoural effect towards cell lines than caffeic acid. It is known that caffeic acid can modulate DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases 1 (DNMT1) mediated DNA methylation. In this paper we demonstrate that caf1 treatment was able to induce a time-dependent reduction of global DNA methylated status. This effect was also confirmed by a concomitant reduction DNMT1 expression level. The effect induced by caf1 was more evident not only with respect to untreated cells but also compared to H3CAF treated cells.", "Monitoring the concentrations of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclooxygenase-inhibiting activities in the surface waters of the Tone Canal and Edo River Basin.\nEnvironmental pollution by pharmaceuticals has become a major problem in many countries worldwide. However, little is known about the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in water sources in Japan. The objective of this study was to clarify variations in the concentrations of seven nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and in cyclooxygenase(COX)-inhibiting activities in river water and domestic wastewater collected from the Tone Canal and the Edo River Basin in Japan. Total NSAID concentrations were higher in the Tone Canal than in the Edo River, and the highest concentration was observed at the domestic wastewater inflow point located in the Tone Canal (concentration averages of salicylic acid, ibuprofen, felbinac, naproxen, mefenamic acid, diclofenac, and ketoprofen in wastewater samples were 55.3, 162.9, 39.7, 11.8, 30.8, 259.7, and 48.3 ng L(-1), respectively). Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry showed that wastewater samples collected during cooler seasons contained higher levels of COX-inhibiting activity. COX-inhibiting activities were highly correlated with NSAID concentrations (particularly for ketoprofen and diclofenac); however, other COX inhibitors, such as NSAIDs that were not examined in this study and/or other chemicals with COX-inhibiting activity, could exist in the water samples because the concentrations of NSAIDs obtained from the water samples did not account for the total COX-inhibiting activities observed. Therefore, COX inhibition assays may be helpful for evaluating the aquatic toxicity of COX inhibitors. In this study, we demonstrated that COX inhibitors in surface water may influence aquatic organisms more than was expected based on NSAID concentrations. Thus, further studies examining other COX inhibitors in the aquatic environment are necessary.", "Anorexia nervosa and bulimia: a prevalence study.\nWe determined the prevalence of anorexia nervosa and bulimia in a large sample of students attending a secondary school on the island of S\u00e3o Miguel (Azores) using the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents, which enabled us to collect the information necessary to make DSM-III diagnoses. Although the prevalence of anorectic and bulimic behaviour was rather high, the partial syndrome of anorexia nervosa was found in only 0.48% of the students (0.76% for girls and 0.17% for boys) and the syndrome of bulimia in only 0.16% (0.30% of the girls; there were no boys with bulimia). The overall prevalence of eating disorders, including partial syndromes, was rather low (0.64%). These results stand in sharp contrast to reports that eating disorders are common and probably getting more common. The low prevalence found in the present survey is probably due to the absence of sociocultural pressures to control eating and weight.", "What are adolescents' experiences of body dissatisfaction and dieting, and what do they recommend for prevention? A qualitative study.\nBody dissatisfaction and dieting are risk factors for eating disorders. Understanding young people's views about factors underlying body dissatisfaction and dieting may be helpful for those designing preventative interventions. This study explored adolescents' views on causes of body dissatisfaction and dieting and recommendations for prevention. Four 1-h focus groups were conducted with 22 female adolescents (aged 13-15 years). Transcripts were explored using thematic analysis. Body dissatisfaction and dieting was explained by four themes: peer acceptance; social comparison online; pressure from family; and pressure from the media and fashion industries. There were seven areas of recommendation for prevention: building sources of support; learning to be critical of the media; monitoring the school gym; working with parents; educating about signs and symptoms of eating disorders; working with people who have suffered from eating disorders; and providing help from professionals. Implications of these findings for the development of prevention programmes are discussed.", "Lyophilization of protein formulations in vials: investigation of the relationship between resistance to vapor flow during primary drying and small-scale product collapse.\nDuring the lyophilization process, formulations containing protein, bulking agent, or lyoprotectant form a dry product layer that can affect the transport of sublimed water vapor. We carried out an investigation of the primary drying segment of lyophilization to evaluate the relationship between the resistance to water vapor flow through the dried layer and the microstructure of the dried cake. Recombinant humanized antibody HER2 (rhuMAb HER2) formulated in trehalose was studied, as were protein-free formulations containing trehalose and sucrose. Sublimation rate and product temperature data were used to compute the resistance to mass transfer. Dried cake structure was examined by scanning electron microscopy and a novel fluorescence microscopy method. Collapse temperatures were determined by freeze-drying microscopy. Mass transfer resistance was found to decrease with increases in temperature for each material. Resistance also depended on composition, decreasing in the formulation series, rhuMAb HER2, trehalose, sucrose. The lyophilized material consisted of porous cakes, with a distinct denser region at the top. Formulation and temperature affected the microstructure of the dried cakes. The formulated trehalose and sucrose were seen, by both microscopy techniques, to possess small (2-20 microm) holes in their platelike structures after lyophilization. The quantity of holes was higher for material dried at higher temperature. The collapse temperature (Tc) of a material appeared to play a role in the process, as lower Tc was correlated with lower resistance and a greater extent of holes. Our results are consistent with the theory that lower resistance to water vapor flow in the primary drying stage of lyophilization may be due to small-scale product collapse.", "In vitro evaluation of the ovistatic and ovicidal effect of the cosmopolitan filamentous fungi isolated from soil on Ascaris suum eggs.\nThe ovicidal activity of seven fungal strains: Acremonium alabamense, Alternaria chlamydospora, Cladosporium herbarum, Fusarium solani, Paecilomyces variotii, Paecilomyces viridis and Penicillium verruculosum isolated from urban soil samples from Poland was determined in vitro. The fungal mycelium was co-cultured with Ascaris suum eggs on plates with 2% water-agar for 28 days. Eggs exposed and unexposed (control) to fungal mycelium were observed weekly by light microscopy and the percentage of malformed eggs were determined. The eggs were classified according to following parameters: type 1 - biochemical and physiological effect without morphological damage to the eggshell; type 2 - lytic effect with morphological alteration of the eggshell and embryo; type 3 - lytic effect with morphological alteration of eggshell and embryo with hyphal penetration and internal egg colonization. All examined species of fungi extended embryogenesis, but the retardation of embryonic development was varied and depended on the species. A. alabamense, A. chlamydospora and P. verruculosum exhibited very high inhibitory activity on A. suum egg development. The fungus-exposed eggs revealed morphological alternations in all stages of embryogenesis. Isolates of F. solani, P. variotii and P. viridis showed hyphal penetration and internal colonization of A. suum eggs (type 3 effect). No appressoria were produced and simple hyphal penetrations were most commonly observed. A. alabamense and P. verruculosum demonstrated morphological destruction, with eggshell destruction. The remaining fungi showed type 1 effect. The results demonstrated that examined strains of F. solani, P. variotii and P. viridis may be considered to be potential limiting factors of parasitic geohelminth populations.", "Investigating the stability of neuropsychiatric sub-syndromes with progression of dementia: a 2-year prospective study.\nPrevious studies have identified sub-syndromes of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. But because of their cross-sectional design, the stability of these sub-syndromes over time remains unknown. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia of 84 participants (out of an original sample of 144 patients) with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia were assessed by using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory every six months for two years. Principal component factor analysis with Varimax rotation was used to detect neuropsychiatric sub-syndromes at each time point. The 12 symptoms were reduced to four factors at baseline, 12, 18, and 24 months and three factors at six months. None of the factor structures matched the four sub-syndromes previously identified by studies. The most stable group of symptoms were a combination of \"psychosis\" and \"hyperactivity\" symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, irritability, agitation), which became stable at 18 months. The pattern of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia sub-syndromes over time has not been studied before, and this research suggests that some stability is evident particularly during the later stages of the disease process. These findings have implications for patients and their caregiver.", "Three and four dimensional ultrasound: a novel method for evaluating fetal cardiac anomalies.\nTo evaluate the role of various new models of 3- and 4-dimensional (3D and 4D) ultrasound (US) applications in prenatal assessment of fetal cardiac anomalies. Volume data sets of 81 fetuses with fetal cardiac anomalies, as previously diagnosed by 2D US, were acquired by 3D and cine 4D using spatiotemporal image correlation (STIC) software. Various additional rendering tools were applied. Color, power, high definition Doppler and B-flow were added to the volumes acquired. A retrospective offline analysis of the cardiac defects was performed. The mean gestational age at diagnosis was 24 weeks (range 13-38); 128 anomalies were detected and were classified into the following categories: I, Situs anomalies in 8 cases; II, abnormal four-chamber view in 63 cases; III, outflows tract anomalies in 27 cases; IV, arches anomalies in 21 cases; and V, veins anomalies in 9 cases. Rendering tools differed in each groups of anomalies. Fetal cardiac anomalies can be evaluated adequately by the information gained by 3D and 4D volumes obtained by STIC. Since no single module is sufficiently accurate for the diagnosis of all cardiac anomalies, each of the cardiac anomaly categories requires different and appropriate module of visualization.", "Relationship between asthma and high blood pressure among adolescents in Aracaju, Brazil.\nAsthma has been linked to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and related risk factors such as hypertension in adults. It is unclear whether the relationship between asthma and hypertension found among adults is also observed in adolescents. Hence, the authors examined asthma and its association with prehypertension and hypertension among adolescents in Aracaju, Brazil. Data on asthma and blood pressure were collected among 1002 adolescents age 12 to 17 years old in 15 public schools, 5 municipal schools, and 10 private schools. Asthma data were ascertained by the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) written questionnaire. Sex-, age-, and height-specific percentile levels were used to define prehypertension (90-94th percentile) and hypertension (>or=95th percentile). The prevalence of asthma was 20.6% in boys and 27.7% in girls. Among boys, the prevalence rates of prehypertension and hypertension were 26.7% and 17.0%, respectively. Among girls, the rates of prehypertension and hypertension were 14.3% and 12.9%, respectively. There were no statistically significant associations between asthma and prehypertension, and hypertension, even after adjusting for age, social economic status, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI) in both boys (prehypertension: odds ratio [OR] = 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80-2.27; hypertension: OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.29-1.23) and girls (prehypertension: OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.40-1.28; hypertension: OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.60-1.94). These results suggest no association between asthma and high blood pressure in adolescents. More prospective studies are needed to establish whether hypertension becomes more pronounced at a specific age in asthmatics, and if so, the possible factors that may contribute to this.", "Capacity to support young low-progress readers at school: experiences of speech-language pathologists.\nThere is a complex interplay between expectations for speech-language pathologists based in primary schools to work with low-progress readers and various factors that may preclude this from actually occurring. This qualitative study investigated experiences and perspectives of nine Australian speech-language pathologists based in primary schools about their capacity to work with low-progress readers. Building on previous quantitative research, this study supported a relatively even split of those who do and do not work with such children. Moreover, thematic analysis revealed that speech-language pathologists face many more barriers than facilitators when attempting to become a member of written language support teams within schools. Facilitators included having a personal interest in reading difficulty as well as working in an environment supportive of speech-language pathology input for low-progress readers. Barriers to working with or participating in teams to support low-progress readers involved factors such as time constraints, resistance from educational colleagues, and a theoretical divide about reading difficulty between educators and speech-language pathologists. Suggested strategies to enhance school-based speech-language pathologists' capacity to operate as key supports for struggling readers are discussed. These include approaches such as aiming to create a more transparent role definition, professional advocacy, and increasing interdisciplinary collaborations at schools.", "1. Two studies begun this year utilize the noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging methodology (MRI) to examine structural details of the living brain. One study, in collaboration with the LDRR, involves the high-resolution imaging on the brain of adult common marmosets, as part of the construction of a brain atlas for this species. A second study, in collaboration with investigators at the Medical University of South Carolina, has used functional MRI (fMRI) to map activity changes in the brains of mothers listening to infant cries. This study is still in progress, but initial results indicate that the anterior cingulate gyrus and adjacent orbital frontal cortex are differentially activated, when compared to control stimuli consisting of noise bursts with similar temporal structure to the infant cry stimuli. 2. Analysis of the vocal behavior of infant rhesus macaques following neonatal ablation of the infero-temporal cortex (area TE) showed a number of abnormalities in the acoustic structure of their calls. Involvement of a neocortical structure in primate phonation has not previously been reported.", "pH Responsive Doxorubicin Delivery by Fluorous Polymers for Cancer Treatment.\nPolymeric nanoparticles have emerged as valuable drug delivery vehicles as they improve solubility of hydrophobic drugs, enhance circulation lifetime, and can improve the biodistribution profile of small-molecule therapeutics. These nanoparticles can take on a host of polymer architectures including polymersomes, hyperbranched nanoparticles, and dendrimers. We have recently reported that simple low molecular weight fluorous copolymers can self-assemble into nanoparticles and show exceptional passive targeting into multiple tumor models. Given the favorable biodistribution of these particles, we sought to develop systems that enable selective delivery in acidic environments, such as the tumor microenvironment or the lysosomal compartment. In this report, we describe the synthesis and in vitro biological studies of a pH-responsive doxorubicin (DOX) fluorous polymer conjugate. A propargyl DOX hydrazone was synthesized and covalently attached to a water-dispersible fluorous polymer composed of trifluoroethyl methacrylate (TFEMA) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (OEGMEMA) using the ligand-accelerated copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition. Driven by the high fluorine content of the copolymer carrier, the DOX-copolymer formed stable micelles under aqueous conditions with a hydrodynamic diameter of 250 nm. The DOX-copolymer showed internalization into multiple in vitro models for breast and ovarian cancer. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated efficacy in both breast and ovarian cancer with overall efficacy being highly dependent on the cell line chosen. Taken together, these results present a platform for the pH-triggered delivery of DOX from a fluorous micelle carrier effective against multiple cancer models in vitro.", "Regulatory volume increase after hypertonicity- or vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-induced cell-volume decrease in small-intestinal crypts is dependent on Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransport.\nThe volume of intact crypts isolated from guinea-pig small intestine has been measured to assess the capacity of the cells to regulate their volume after hypertonic shock or vasoactive-intestinal-peptide (VIP)-induced shrinkage. Crypts exposed to anisotonic medium initially behave as perfect osmometers. Continued exposure to a hypertonic (400 mosmol/l) medium was followed by regulatory volume increase (RVI), which led to complete volume recovery in about 20 min. VIP produced a volume reduction, attributed to KCl loss through channels activated by the secretagogue, without any recovery during exposure to the polypeptide. Removal of VIP led to an increase of cellular volume towards control levels. This volume recovery after secretagogue-induced shrinkage is termed SVI. Both RVI and SVI were abolished by removal of Na+ or Cl- from the bathing solution, by addition of the loop diuretic bumetanide (1 microM), but not by addition of ethylisopropylamiloride (10 microM) or amiloride (1 mM). Cell shrinkage was also observed when tonicity was increased by addition of 100 mM NaCl or 200 mM D-mannitol, but RVI was seen only when NaCl was the added osmolyte. The ion dependence, pharmacological sensitivity and thermodynamic considerations of these effects are consistent with the operation of a Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransport mechanism activated by cell shrinkage and the secretagogue action of VIP.", "Epitopes recognized by neutralizing therapy-induced human anti-interferon-alpha antibodies are localized within the N-terminal functional domain of recombinant interferon-alpha 2.\nDuring prolonged recombinant interferon (rIFN)-alpha 2 therapy, a minority of patients develop high-titer neutralizing IFN-alpha antibodies. Sera from nine IFN-alpha antibody-positive patients were studied to characterize the specificity of anti-IFN-alpha neutralizing antibodies by their ability to inhibit the antiviral and antiproliferative activity of different rIFN-alpha subtypes and rIFN-alpha 1/alpha 2 hybrids. These therapy-induced antibodies (Tab) were compared with IFN-alpha-specific autoantibodies (Aab) from two patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who had never received any exogenous IFN-alpha. Although IFN-alpha subtypes are closely related in structure, Tab inhibited the antiviral activity of only recombinant (r)IFN-alpha 2 and rIFN-alpha 6, but not or slightly that of rIFN-alpha 1, -alpha 7, -alpha 8 and -alpha 14. Furthermore, of four different rIFN-alpha 1/alpha 2 hybrids tested, Tab inhibited only those which contained the N-terminal residues 17-64 of rIFN-alpha 2. Comparison of the primary sequences of neutralized and not neutralized subtypes suggests an epitope involving the residues 22-31 of IFN-alpha 2 is recognized. Thus, Tab block rIFN-alpha 2 by reacting with only one of two functional domains. In contrast, Aab possessed a broad specificity and neutralized both the antiviral and antiproliferative activity of rIFN-alpha 2, -alpha 6, -alpha 7, -alpha 8, and -alpha 14. They also neutralized all four rIFN-alpha 1/alpha 2 hybrids tested. These data demonstrate that Tab are highly specific for the therapeutic IFN-alpha subtype and specifically neutralize rIFN-alpha 2 by binding to its N-terminal functional domain.", "Effects of patient education and therapeutic suggestions on cataract surgery patients: a randomized controlled clinical trial.\nThis paper describes a randomized controlled single blind study testing the effects of a patient education intervention combined with positive therapeutic suggestions on anxiety for cataract surgery patients. 84 patients participated in the study. Physiological and behavioral indicators of anxiety were compared between a regularly treated control and an intervention group receiving an audio CD containing information, relaxation, and positive imagery. We found that the intervention group was calmer throughout the four measurement points of the study (p=.004; d=0.71) and they were more cooperative (p=.01; d=0.60) during the operation. The groups did not differ in sleep quality before the day of the operation, heart rate during the procedure, and subjective Well-being. Findings indicate that preoperative information combined with positive suggestions and anxiety management techniques might reduce patient anxiety in the perioperative period of cataract surgery, but further research is needed to investigate the benefits of such interventions and to uncover the underlying mechanisms. Patient education interventions providing additional anxiety management techniques are recommended for use prior to cataract surgery.", "Characterization of the inhibition of glutathione reductase and the recovery of enzyme activity in exponentially growing murine leukemia (L1210) cells treated with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea.\nThe inactivation of the enzyme glutathione reductase by 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) was studied in exponentially growing murine leukemia cells. A 1-hr incubation with 1.6 +/- 0.2 microM BCNU resulted in a 50% inhibition of glutathione reductase, while 10 microM BCNU caused total inhibition of the enzyme. The time required for 50% inhibition of glutathione reductase by 10 microM BCNU was 7 min. The recovery of glutathione reductase activity was studied by incubating cells with 10 microM BCNU for 30 min to inhibit all glutathione reductase activity, washing the cells free of drug, and continuing the incubation in fresh medium. Fifty percent of the activity returned within 12 hr. Glutathione reductase activity recovered normally when cell growth and DNA synthesis were inhibited in the cells, but it failed to recover when protein synthesis was inhibited. Therefore, the inactivation of glutathione reductase appears irreversible, and the recovery of enzymatic activity is dependent on the synthesis of new protein. Continuous incubation with 19.8 +/- 0.4 microM BCNU resulted in a 50% inhibition of cell growth. A 1-hr incubation with 7.3 +/- 0.8 microM BCNU resulted in a 50% loss of viability as measured by a soft agar clonogenic assay. These experiments quantify the inhibition of glutathione reductase by BCNU and the recovery of enzyme activity in the context of the toxic effects of the compound. A clinically useful inhibitor of glutathione reductase will require a wider difference between the concentrations required for enzyme inhibition and cytotoxicity than BCNU provides.", "Chemometric modeling and prediction of trihalomethane formation in Barcelona's water works plant.\nFormation and occurrence of trihalomethanes (CHCl3, CHBr3, CHCl2Br, and CHBr2Cl) are investigated in water chlorination disinfection processes in the Barcelona's water works plant (WWP). Twenty-three WWP variables were measured and investigated for correlation with trihalomethane formation. Multivariate statistical methods including principal component analysis (PCA), multilinear regression (MLR), stepwise MLR (SWR), principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) have been used and compared to model and predict the complex behavior observed for the measured trihalomethane concentrations. The results, obtained by PCA as well as the evaluation of the statistical significance of the coefficients in the linear regression vectors, revealed that the most important WWP variables for trihalomethane formation were: water temperature, total organic carbon, added chlorine concentrations, UV absorbance and turbidity at different sites of the WWP, as well as other variables like wells supply flow levels and carbon filters age. Overall, MLR and PLSR methods performed the best and gave similar good predictive properties. Best results were obtained for the total sum of trihalomethane concentrations, TTHM, with average modeling and prediction relative errors of 12% and 16%, respectively. Among the individual trihalomethanes, the concentrations of CHBr3 were the worst predicted ones with average modeling and prediction relative errors between 21-25% and 29-31%, respectively, followed by CHCl2Br with 23-26% and 25-27%. Better predictions were obtained for the concentrations of CHBr2Cl with relative modeling and prediction errors varying between 14-17% and 21%, and for the concentrations of CHCl3 with 21-24% and 23-25% errors, respectively.", "End-of-life healthcare decision-making: the intermediary role of the ethicist in supporting family caregivers and health professionals.\nFamily support in end-of-life decision-making is critical, yet this issue receives little attention. The purpose of this research is to provide insight into how the clinical ethicist can effectively support family caregivers when making end-of-life healthcare decisions. It further suggests how the clinical ethicist can provide support to other healthcare professionals who work with family caregivers in making end-of-life healthcare decisions. Using a grounded theory approach, a theoretical sampling of 20 family caregivers previously involved in end-of-life decision-making were interviewed. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were audiotaped, and transcribed. Interviews were analyzed using a constant comparative approach. The analysis resulted in the identification of three categories related to the experience of decision-making: the impact of healthcare decision-making on individual and family well-being, the effectiveness of healthcare professionals in supporting families, and the role of the ethicist. The results demonstrated the challenges that family members encounter when faced with end-of-life decision-making. The participants identified the importance of having access to a clinical ethicist who, with objectivity and specific training, can better meet the needs of family caregivers and improve the process of decision-making at the end-of-life.", "Advanced trans-tibial socket fabrication using selective laser sintering.\nThere have been a variety of efforts demonstrating the use of solid freeform fabrication (SFF) for prosthetic socket fabrication though there has been little effort in leveraging the strengths of the technology. SFF encompasses a class of technologies that can create three dimensional objects directly from a geometric database without specific tooling or human intervention. A real strength of SFF is that cost of fabrication is related to the volume of the part, not the part's complexity. For prosthetic socket fabrication this means that a sophisticated socket can be fabricated at essentially the same cost as a simple socket. Adding new features to a socket design becomes a function of software. The work at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA) and University of Texas at Austin (UTA) has concentrated on developing advanced sockets that incorporate structural features to increase comfort as well as built in fixtures to accommodate industry standard hardware. Selective laser sintering (SLS) was chosen as the SFF technology to use for socket fabrication as it was capable of fabricating sockets using materials appropriate for prosthetics. This paper details the development of SLS prosthetic socket fabrication techniques at UTHSCSA/UTA over a six-year period.", "Activation of hepatocyte growth factor by two homologous proteases, blood-coagulation factor XIIa and hepatocyte growth factor activator.\nHepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is secreted as an inactive single-chain precursor from the producing cells, and normally remains in this form associated with the extracellular matrix. In response to tissue injury, the single-chain precursor is converted to a biologically active heterodimer by a serine protease, the activity of which is induced in the injured tissue. We have previously identified HGF activator, a serum serine protease that activates single-chain HGF. The sequence of HGF activator cDNA revealed that the HGF activator is homologous to blood-coagulation factor XIIa. In this study, we found that coagulation factor XIIa has an ability to activate single-chain HGF. Factor XIIa exhibited a significant level of HGF-converting activity in the presence of dextran sulfate, although the specific activity of factor XIIa was slightly lower than that of the HGF activator. Since factor XIIa is activated during the initiation of contact activation induced by tissue injury, factor XIIa may function as an HGF-converting enzyme together with HGF activator in the injured tissue. C1-inhibitor, antithrombin III and alpha 2-antiplasmin, that regulate the blood-clotting activity of factor XIIa, were also effective against the HGF-converting activity of factor XIIa. Furthermore, factor XIIa was not active in the HGF-converting activity in serum. Thus, the HGF-converting activity of factor XIIa may be regulated by these serum inhibitors.", "Contamination with explosives in analytical laboratory procedure.\nThe philosophy underlying the procedure with the trace from the moment of the securing of the evidence up to its ultimate inspection is of significance for the result achieved. Hands of the people who conduct investigative action or of the experts involved in examinations contaminated with explosives may adversely affect results of the analyses. The contamination effect is one of the most dangerous consequences of non-observance of the strict rules in handling the traces secured on the crime scene. The aim of this research work was to examine whether at all, and if so, with what an ease and at which stage of the analytical procedure there occurs a likely contamination of the evidence material with explosives such as TNT, RDX, PETN, NG. The analytical procedure employed consisted of the sampling stage, extraction from gauze swab, transfer of the extract and execution of an instrumental analysis based on gas chromatography with electron capture detector (ECD). The most significant contamination effect was observed during the analytical procedure for TNT, followed by a similar, yet less pronounced, for RDX and PETN. Contaminating the research material with nitroglycerin, known to be liquid under normal conditions, proved unsuccessful.", "Studies are proposed on axonal transport and transneuronal transfer to further understanding of the development and maintenance of synaptic connections. Axonal transport, the process by which macromolecules synthesized in the nerve cell body are conveyed to other regions of the cell, is especially important during axonal elongation and synaptic development when protein demand is high and composition changing. Furthermore, speculation abounds that the fraction of transported material that is transferred transneuronally may subserve a trophic or informational role in the receiving cell. A retrogradely transported component is thought to carry information about the changing environment of the nerve ending. Experimental approaches in this proposal are centered on analysis of axonally transported proteins and on quantitation of transport rates and transneuronal transfer, both before and after the onset of functional visual activity. Particular attention will be given to synaptosomal membrane proteins, including the (Na ion plus K ion)-dependent ATPase, and to fibrillar neuronal proteins. The plasticity of both retrograde transport and transneuronal transfer in response to neonatal visual system trauma will be evaluated. The proposed study has significance for understanding development and repair mechanisms in the nervous system and forms a basis for future work on rehabilitation of severe visual impairments, such as glaucoma.", "Biosorption of a reactive dye (Rhodamine-B) from an aqueous solution using dried biomass of activated sludge.\nLow cost, locally available biomaterial was tested for its ability to remove reactive dyes from aqueous solution. Granules prepared from dried activated sludge (DAS) were utilized as a sorbent for the uptake of Rhodamine-B (Rh-B) dye. The effects of various experimental parameters (dye concentration, sludge concentrations, swelling, pretreatment and other factors) were investigated and optimal experimental conditions were ascertained. Nearly 15min was required for the equilibrium adsorption, and Rh-B dyes could be removed effectively. Dye removal performance of Rh-B and DAS increased with increasing concentrations. The acid pretreated biomass exhibited a slightly better biosorption capacity than alkali pretreated or non-pretreated biomass. The optimum swelling time for dye adsorption of the DAS within the swelling time range studied was 12h. Both the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models could describe the adsorption equilibrium of the reactive dye onto the activated sludge with the Langmuir isotherm showing the better agreement of the two. Second-order kinetic models confirmed the agreement.", "Effect of ABVD therapeutic protocol on oncogene and tumor suppressor gene expression in CBA/Ca mice.\nThe in vivo investigation of onco/suppressor gene effects may provide new information on chemical-environmental carcinogenesis. We previously described the elevation of onco/suppressor gene expression due to CHOP and COPP chemotherapeutical protocols in a CBA/Ca mouse model. Below we describe the results of the onco/suppressor gene expression studies after treatment with ABVD, a non-cyclophosphamide containing protocol. Expression of c-myc, Ha-ras, and p53 genes was investigated 1/2, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 hours, 2 6 30 days, 6, and 12 months after treatment with a single dose of ABVD protocol. RNA was isolated from the thymus, spleen, liver, bone marrow, kidneys, and hybridzed with chemiluminescently labelled probes of Ha-ras, c-myc, and p53 genes. Significant changes of gene expression was found in the spleen and thymus, even after 30 minutes. The female spleen seemed to be more sensitive than the male one, but no sex difference was observed in the thymus. No significant alteration was detected in the other investigated organs.", "Two good reasons for an angiotensin-II type 1 receptor blockade with losartan after cardiac transplantation: reduction of incidence and severity of transplant vasculopathy.\nDespite considerable progress in immunosuppressive therapy, the incidence and severity of transplant vasculopathy (TVP) after cardiac transplantation have not declined. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contributing to TVP. We compared the effects of an angiotensin-II blocker, losartan (AT(1) blocker), and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, on the incidence of diseased vessels and the severity of experimental TVP in the Lewis-to-Fischer rat heterotopic heart transplantation model. Recipients were randomly divided into six groups, group 1: no therapy, group 2: 3 mg/kg per day cyclosporine (CyA) s.c., group 3: CyA and 10 mg/kg per day losartan p.o., group 4: CyA and 40 mg/kg per day enalapril p.o., and groups 5 and 6: as groups 3 and 4, but additionally pre-treated with losartan or enalapril 7 days prior to transplantation. Eighty days after grafting, we assessed the incidence and severity of TVP, expressed as percentage of diseased vessels and mean vessel occlusion (MVO), by digitizing morphometry. CyA and CyA/enalapril post-treatment significantly reduced MVO, compared with controls, but not the incidence. Additional reduction of MVO was achieved in CyA/enalapril pre-treatment and both CyA/losartan pre- and post-treatment groups when compared with CyA and untreated controls. However, only losartan post-treatment in combination with CyA reduced both incidence and MVO. Our results validate the important role of the RAS in neointimal proliferation after cardiac transplantation. Losartan appears to be superior to enalapril in preventing TVP after experimental cardiac transplantation. Therefore, AT(1) blockade with losartan might be a therapeutic option for the prevention of TVP in human heart recipients.", "Bone sarcoma characteristics and distribution in beagles fed strontium-90.\nA total of 66 primary bone sarcomas were diagnosed in 47 beagles; 43 of these dogs were part of the 403 beagles fed 90Sr and 4 were part of the 162 controls. Multiple primary bone sarcomas were found in 15 of the 47 beagles (32%). The incidence of multiple primary bone sarcoma was restricted to the two highest dose groups, except for a single control dog which developed two bone sarcomas. A threshold-like radiation dose response was observed; no sarcomas were observed in the lowest three dose groups, but the number of primary bone sarcomas increased rapidly in the higher dose groups. Of the 66 primary sarcomas, 49 were osteosarcomas (74%). As the dose increased, the proportion of osteosarcomas increased sharply, 4/10 (40%), 26/29 (90%), and 16/18 (89%), in the three highest dose groups. Thirteen of the bone sarcomas of other types occurred in males, and 4 in females, whereas 21 osteosarcomas occurred in males, and 28 in females. The ratio of bone sarcomas of the appendicular skeleton to those in the axial skeleton was 40:26, with osteosarcomas occurring more often in the appendicular than the axial skeleton (32:17), whereas nonosteogenic tumors showed no predilection (8:9). A statistical study of the distribution of bone sarcomas among 16 separate bone groups showed a correlation only with the distribution of cancellous bone volume-to-surface ratio and not with either skeletal mass distribution or dose distribution. The highest occurrence of sarcomas was in the humeri, femora, and mandible, and no occurrence in the coccygeal vertebrae, paws, or sternum. It is postulated that the distribution of bone sarcomas reflects a critical combination of the osteosarcoma precursor cell population, their cell division rate, and the radiation dose absorbed by these cells.", "A comparison of parietal and iliac crest bone grafts for orbital reconstruction.\nThis study evaluated the results of cranial (membranous) versus iliac crest (endochondral) bone grafts as implants to correct post-traumatic globe malposition and/or diplopia. Twenty-two patients underwent 25 orbital reconstructions with bone for enophthalmos, hypophthalmos, and diplopia after trauma to the orbit. Inclusion criteria consisted of at least 4 months postsurgical follow-up, pre- and postsurgical quantitative orbital measurements, photographic documentation, and complete medical records regarding inpatient and outpatient data. Nine cranial bone grafts and 16 iliac crest grafts were placed. Ages were similar in both groups. The average follow-up was 24 months for the cranial graft group (range, 4 to 54 months) and 18 months for the iliac crest graft group (range, 4 to 51 months). Preoperative enophthalmos averaged 4.11 and 5.06 mm in the cranial and iliac crest groups, respectively, and postoperatively the measurements were 1.78 and 1.37 mm, respectively. Changes in hypophthalmos generally reflected changes in the enophthalmos correction. In 10 patients diplopia was corrected by the procedure. There was a statistically significant change in the enophthalmos of patients when comparing pre- and postoperative status, but no statistically significant difference between the results of the cranial and iliac crest graft groups. There is no difference in the ability of cranial and iliac crest bone grafts to correct post-traumatic enophthalmos.", "South Florida has a motorcycle problem, and lawmakers are introducing legislation to show bikers that they'll go a long way to punish those who break the rules. Stunt riding (including wheelies), excessive speeding , and concealable license plates will get you a 10 year ban on your motorcycle license, mandatory jail time, and an impounded bike. If the punishment sounds like the medieval practice of cutting off the hand of a man for stealing, that's exactly how State Representative Carlos Lopez-Cantera wants it.Lopez-Cantera witnessed firsthand a variety of incidents during which reckless behavior was on display, including bikers flying down the highway at 120 mph, high speed wheelies, and more. Police officers can't even run plates since bikers will often flip them up to avoid detection, and it's very difficult to catch a motorcycle on the open road with a squad car. We like motorcycles , even though our focus is on cars, and it's disappointing to see that things have apparently gotten so out of hand in South Florida that draconian enforcement policies are being seriously discussed.[Source: Visor Down via Paultan", "Ventriculo-vascular interaction in the normal development of the fetal circulation.\nTo examine cardiovascular physiology in the healthy fetus during normal development. Twenty normal fetuses were studied longitudinally from 20 weeks to term. Serial echocardiography was performed, and arterial and venous diameter pulse wave characteristics and aortic pulse wave propagation velocity (PWV) were examined in the thoracic descending aorta (AoD) and inferior caval vein (IVC) using an ultrasonic phase-locked echo-tracking system. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, paired t-test and logistic regression where appropriate. Aortic PWV, maximum incremental and late decremental velocities increased with gestation while the relative pulse amplitude decreased, reflecting falling distal impedance. There was a linear increase in cardiac preload and relative pulse amplitude in the IVC with gestation that correlated significantly with the presence of end-diastolic flow in the pulmonary artery and improvement in right ventricular diastolic function. Non-invasive concurrent assessment of preload, ventricular function and impedance are possible in the fetus and may prove useful in the longitudinal study of fetal adaptation to pathophysiological changes.", "Functional equality in the absence of structural similarity: an added dimension to molecular mimicry.\nThe crystal structure of meso-tetrasulfonatophenylporphyrin complexed with concanavalin A (ConA) was determined at 1.9 A resolution. Comparison of this structure with that of ConA bound to methyl alpha-d-mannopyranoside provided direct structural evidence of molecular mimicry in the context of ligand receptor binding. The sulfonatophenyl group of meso-tetrasulfonatophenylporphyrin occupies the same binding site on ConA as that of methyl alpha-d-mannopyranoside, a natural ligand. A pair of stacked porphyrin molecules stabilizes the crystal structure by end-to-end cross-linking with ConA resulting in a network similar to that observed upon agglutination of cells by lectins. The porphyrin binds to ConA predominantly through hydrogen bonds and water-mediated interactions. The sandwiched water molecules in the complex play a cementing role, facilitating favorable binding of porphyrin. Seven of the eight hydrogen bonds observed between methyl alpha-d-mannopyranoside and ConA are mimicked by the sulfonatophenyl group of porphyrin after incorporating two water molecules. Thus, the similarity in chemical interactions was manifested in terms of functional mimicry despite the obvious structural dissimilarity between the sugar and the porphyrin.", "Validity and reliability of the 'Ten Questions' questionnaire for detecting moderate to severe neurological impairment in children aged 6-9 years in rural Kenya.\nThe 'Ten Questions' Questionnaire (TQQ) is used to detect severe neurological impairment in children living in resource-poor countries. Its usefulness has been established in Asia and the Caribbean, but there are a few published studies from Africa. We evaluated the TQQ as part of a larger study of neurological impairment in a rural community, on the coast of Kenya. The study was conducted in two phases from June 2001 to May 2002; in phase one, a community household screening of 10,218 children aged 6-9 years using the TQQ was performed. Phase two involved a comprehensive clinical and psychological assessment of all children testing positive on the TQQ (n = 810) and an equivalent number of those testing negative (n = 766). Data were interpreted using the impairment-specific approach. Overall, the sensitivity rates for screening the different impairments were: cognitive (70.0%), motor (71.4%), epilepsy (100%), hearing (87.4%) and visual (77.8%). All the specificity rates were greater than 96%. However, the positive predictive values were low, and ranged from 11 to 33%. These results are similar to those from other continents and provide evidence that the TQQ can be used to compare the epidemiology of moderate/severe impairment in different parts of the world. Furthermore, the TQQ can be used to screen for moderately/severely impaired children in resource-poor countries; however, the low positive predictive values mean that other assessments are required for confirmation.", "Cadmium in human lung tissue.\nIn 101 unselected autopsies, cadmium (Cd) in lung tissue was analyzed by means of flameless atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The subjects originated from Bochum (BO), Dortmund (DO), and neighbouring cities in the Ruhr District (BO/DO) as well as from Muenster (MS) and vicinity. The sample included eight persons who had died from bronchial carcinoma. The Cd concentration in lung tissue (CdL) did not show a significant age-dependency. There was only a slight increase of CdL in the age around 50. For males, the median CdL value was found to be 1.32 micrograms/g dry wt in the age group from 20-45, 1.48 micrograms/g dry wt from 45-65, and 0.64 micrograms/g dry wt greater than 65 (the corresponding means and standard deviations were 1.48 +/- 1.22, 1.73 +/- 1.42, and 1.18 +/- 1.27 micrograms/g dry wt). CdL in men was twice that in women. There were no differences between the two regions (BO/DO:MS) examined. CdL of the bronchial carcinoma cases were mostly clearly above the expected level, often similar to the Cr and Ni concentration of the same specimens. Besides the amount of inhaled metal aerosols, insufficient lung clearance may play a leading role for their retention in lung parenchyma. However, with regard to the determination of causality between uptake and disease the data are difficult to interpret, in our study due to a lack of enough consistent and reliable data on occupation, environment, and smoking habits, and in general due to a lot of variables which, until now, cannot be sufficiently quantified.", "Peterman, the 171st overall pick this past April, is a classic pocket passer with C+ arm talent. Although he lacks the cannon to push the ball to every area of the field, he is a rhythm passer adept at getting the ball \"out and up\" quickly on deep throws. As a \"connect the dots\" passer from the pocket, Peterman is at his best working the short and intermediate areas of the field. Peterman's ability to rapidly work through progressions -- and get to his second or third option -- made him an effective passer at Pitt. He completed 61.1 percent of his passes and posted a 47:15 TD-to-INT ratio while averaging 8.3 yards per attempt during his two-year stint as a starter. Those numbers were complemented by the 518 rushing yards and three rushing scores Peterman amassed while directing Panthers' unique pro-style offense, which featured a lot of misdirection action (jet sweep) and option plays in the backfield. Although he isn't an A-level athlete or an explosive dual-threat playmaker, Peterman has enough mobility and movement skills to be a competent runner on zone-read plays and some designed quarterback runs.", "Occupationally related hydrogen sulfide deaths in the United States from 1984 to 1994.\nAlice Hamilton described fatal work injuries from acute hydrogen sulfide poisonings in 1925 in her book Industrial Poisons in the United States. There is no unique code for H2S poisoning in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision; therefore, these deaths cannot be identified easily from vital records. We reviewed US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) investigation records for the period 1984 to 1994 for mention of hazardous substance 1480 (hydrogen sulfide). There were 80 fatalities from hydrogen sulfide in 57 incidents, with 19 fatalities and 36 injuries among coworkers attempting to rescue fallen workers. Only 17% of the deaths were at workplaces covered by collective bargaining agreements. OSHA issued citations for violation of respiratory protection and confined space standards in 60% of the fatalities. The use of hydrogen sulfide detection equipment, air-supplied respirators, and confined space safety training would have prevented most of the fatalities.", "Effects of agents which interact with central benzodiazepine binding sites on stress-induced ultrasounds in rat pups.\nCompounds of different chemical classes, with affinity for central benzodiazepine receptors, were investigated for effects on handling-induced ultrasonic cries in rat pups. Diazepam and clobazam inhibited ultrasounds and impaired motor performance at higher doses. Suriclone showed a similar profile to diazepam but premazepam clearly separated ultrasound inhibition from motor impairment. ZK 91296, CGS 9896, RU 39419 and RU 43028 inhibited ultrasounds with a lower maximal response but induced little or no motor incoordination. CL 218872 inconsistently inhibited sounds with no motor impairment and PK 8165 and PK 9084 had no consistent effects. Benzodiazepine antagonists weakly inhibited (RU 40410) or did not affect (Ro 15-1788 or CGS 8216) ultrasounds alone but fully (Ro 15-1788 or CGS 8216) or partially (RU 40410) antagonised the effects of benzodiazepines. Inverse agonists FG 7142, methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (BCM) and DMCM tended to increase ultrasounds alone, particularly when less stressful handling stimuli were used, and antagonised benzodiazepines. This procedure detects the differing behavioural effects of benzodiazepines receptor ligands and is proposed as a simple model of anxiety.", "Paresthesia and sensory disturbances associated with 2009 pandemic vaccine receipt: Clinical features and risk factors.\nParesthesia was the third-most-common adverse event following immunization (AEFI) with 2009 monovalent AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine in Quebec, Canada and was also frequently reported in Europe. This study assessed clinical features and risk factors associated with this unexpected AEFI. Reports to the passive surveillance system were summarized. A case-control study was conducted to assess risk factors and additional investigations were undertaken among cases with symptoms persisting \u226512 months. There were 328 reports of paresthesia affecting the vaccinated arm (58%), but also face (45%), lower limbs (40%) and back/thorax (23%) with numbness but also muscle weakness (61%), motor impairment (61%), generalized myalgia (37%), visual (14%) and/or speech effects (15%). Reporting rate was highest in women of reproductive age, peaking at 30-39 years-old (28/100,000 doses administered) and exceeding that of men of the same age (7/100,000 doses) by 4-fold. Median time to onset was 2h. Symptoms subsided within one week in 37% but lasted \u22656 months in 26%. No consistent or objective neurological findings were identified. Risk was increased with allergy history, respiratory illness the day of vaccination, depressive symptoms and family history of pulmonary disease, but decreased with physical activity the day of vaccination, and regular weekly alcohol consumption. Paresthesia following 2009 pandemic vaccine receipt lasted several weeks and included other motor-sensory disturbances in an important subset of patients. Although it does not correspond with known neurological disease, and causality remains uncertain, further investigation is warranted to understand the nature and frequency of paresthesia as a possible AEFI with influenza vaccines.", "Role of differential expression of interferon receptor isoforms on the response of multiple sclerosis patients to therapy with interferon beta.\nThe cytokine interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 is successfully used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. However, some patients fail to respond to therapy, probably due to different biological patterns that are of importance in influencing clinical response. A common mechanism involved in the modulation of responsiveness to cytokine is represented by regulation of their receptor expression through autocrine-ligand-mediated loops. Mechanistically, IFN-\u03b2 exerts its biological effects through interaction with the IFN-\u03b1/-\u03b2-receptor (IFNAR), which then activates several transcription factors. IFNAR is composed of 2 chains, IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2, which associate with IFN-\u03b2 to form a ternary complex. The major ligand-binding subunit is IFNAR-2 and it exists in 3 mRNA splice variants, resulting in 2 transmembrane (IFNAR-2b and IFNAR-2c) isoforms and a soluble (IFNAR-2a) one. On the contrary, from normal cells only one IFNAR-1 isoform, with transcriptional capacity, was identified. In the past decades, considerable information has accumulated pertaining to the downregulation of the IFNAR complex in IFN-treated patients, but only a few studies have investigated the molecular events involved in this phenomenon. The intent of the present review is to place this receptor downregulation in the context of IFN-\u03b2 therapy and of its clinical and biological outcomes in IFN-\u03b2-treated patients.", "Management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\nInitial management of acute upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding depends on the clinical status of the patient. Symptoms of reduced blood volume or shock are clear indications for blood transfusion; oxygen therapy also may be needed. A brief history and physical examination, gastric aspiration, and gastric lavage help in ascertaining if bleeding is in the UGI tract; endoscopy, barium x-ray studies, and angiography help to identify the exact site. Bleeding from the most common causes of UGI tract hemorrhage--duodenal and gastric ulcers, esophagitis, and Mallory-Weiss tears--stops spontaneously or with gastric lavage in about 85% of patients. Patients with variceal hemorrhage have a worse prognosis and require intensive care. Vasopressin (Pitressin) infusion, either intravenous or intraarterial, is the first treatment to try. If it is not effective, balloon tamponade, sclerotherapy if available, or surgery may be necessary. Advances in medical, endoscopic, and surgical therapy may reduce morbidity and mortality in the future.", "Partitioning of tryptophan side-chain analogs between water and cyclohexane.\nWe have measured the partitioning of the tryptophan side-chain analogs 3-methylindole and N-methylindole between water and cyclohexane over the temperature range 8-55 degrees C to investigate the relative contribution of the imine-NH- to the free energy of transfer. We take advantage of the fact that the indole imine nitrogen is blocked by a methyl group in N-methylindole. Unlike previous studies, we take into account the water present in the cyclohexane phase. Free energies of partitioning were calculated using mole-fraction, volume-fraction, and Flory-Huggins-corrected volume-fraction partition coefficients [De Young, L. R., & Dill, K. A. (1990) J. Phys. Chem. 94, 801-809; Sharp, K. A., Nicholls, A., Friedman, R., & Honig, B. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 9686-9697]. These approaches account for configurational entropy changes in different ways and thus lead to different values for the calculated free energies of transfer. There is a 2-3-fold difference in the free energies calculated from our measurements, using the different units. Independent of units, the partitioning of both compounds involves identical entropy changes. However, 3-methylindole has an additional unfavorable enthalpic contribution to partitioning into cyclohexane of +1.6 kcal/mol (independent of units) which is presumably the cost of removing the indole -NH- group from water and transferring it to cyclohexane. In cyclohexane, 3-methylindole forms hydrogen bonds with water that cause water to copartition into cyclohexane with the solute. A method is described which allows the partitioning process to be examined independent of subsequent interactions with water in the solvent.", "Determination of pharmacologically active ingredients in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) by capillary electrophoresis with electrochemical detection.\nSweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.), in which vitamin C, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, quercetin, and rutin are abundant, is one of the functional food products aimed at introducing human dietary ingredients that aid specific body functions in addition to being nutritious. A method based on capillary electrophoresis with electrochemical detection (CE-ED) to qualitatively and quantitatively determine the pharmacologically active ingredients in sweet potato has been developed by our group. The effects of working electrode potential, pH and concentration of running buffer, separation voltage, applied potential, and injection time on CE-ED were investigated. Under the optimum conditions, the analytes could be well-separated within 20 min at the separation voltage of 18 kV in a 60 mmol L(-1) Borax running buffer (pH 9.0). A good linear relationship was established between peak current and concentration of analytes over 2 orders of magnitude with detection limits (S/N = 3) ranging from 7.14 x 10(-7) to 2.88 x 10(-7) g mL(-1) for all target ingredients. The satisfactory results show that this method is very successful and effective for the analysis of real samples.", "Physiological responses to fitness activities: a comparison between land-based and water aerobics exercise.\nThis study compared the heart rate (HR) and blood lactate (BL) responses in young healthy women performing the same routine of aerobics exercise in 3 different conditions: on land, in shallow water (0.8 m), and in deep water (1.4 m). The average age and body mass index (BMI) of the group were 27.4 years and 22.6 kg.m(-2), respectively. The highest HR and BL values were reached during land aerobics (median HR values were 138.0 and 161.5 b.min(-1), and lactate values were 3.10 and 5.65 mmol.L(-1) at slow and at faster pace, respectively). These parameters were progressively reduced going from shallow water (121.5 and 154.0 b.min(-1), 1.75 and 3.15 mmol.L(-1)) to deep water (97.5 and 113.5 b.min(-1), 1.70 and 1.75 mmol.L(-1)). The HR measured as percentage of maximum HR varied from 48.43% to 77.53% depending on the water depth and the pace. These data indicate that exercise in water significantly reduces HR and BL production compared with the same exercise performed on land.", "Poor adherence to influenza vaccination guidelines in spinal cord injury: results from a community-based survey in Switzerland.\nCross-sectional survey. To evaluate the annual influenza vaccination coverage rate (IVCR) among community-dwelling individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI community in Switzerland. Participants were responders to the influenza vaccination question (n = 492) in the 2012 community survey of the Swiss Spinal Cord Injury (SwiSCI) cohort study. IVCR of SwiSCI participants were compared to the normative Swiss population, sampled in the Swiss Health Survey of 2012 using direct standardization, logistic regression standardization, and a genetic matching approach to control for differences in age, sex, and quarterly period of survey response. Individuals with SCI showed higher crude (26%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 22-30%) and age- and sex-standardized (24%, CI: 23-24%) IVCR than observed in the general population (15% CI, 14-15%). The adjustment for age and sex as well as quarterly period of survey response showed that the standardized IVCR of individuals with SCI (17%; CI: 12-23%) approached that of the general population. Low IVCR of about 10% were found among individuals with SCI younger than 45 years. IVCR were similar between men and women and between individuals with incomplete and complete paraplegia and tetraplegia. The IVCR in individuals with chronic SCI was not higher than in the general population and much lower than guidelines recommend. The improvement of the IVCR is an important target of health policy in SCI in Switzerland as to reduce the evidenced excess burden in respiratory-disease related morbidity and mortality.", "Rapid increase in grip force after start of pamidronate therapy in children and adolescents with severe osteogenesis imperfecta.\nTo examine changes in grip force during pamidronate therapy in children and adolescents with severe osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Maximal isometric grip force of the nondominant hand was prospectively determined in 42 patients (age at the start of the study: 7.3-15.9 years; 18 girls) with severe forms of OI. Patients were treated with intravenous pamidronate infusions given in 4 monthly cycles, each cycle consisting of 3 infusions (1 mg pamidronate/kg body wt) on 3 successive days. At the start of pamidronate therapy, grip force was low compared with age-specific reference data (age z score mean +/- standard deviation: -2.7 +/- 2.1) but was normal for weight (weight z score: -0.1 +/- 1.8). Four months after the first pamidronate infusion cycle, grip force had increased significantly, whether related to age (age z score: -2.0 +/- 1.8) or to weight (weight z score: 0.6 +/- 1.5). At 2 years after the start of therapy, grip force z scores were not significantly different from the 4-month results. Maximal isometric grip force markedly increases after a single cycle of intravenous pamidronate in children with severe forms of OI, and this gain in grip force is maintained for at least 2 years.", "Endometrial cancer risk in estrogen users after switching to estrogen-progestin therapy.\nIt is unknown whether postmenopausal unopposed estrogen users are better off, in terms of endometrial cancer risk, switching to a combined estrogen-progestin regimen or stopping hormone use altogether. We analyzed data from a series of three population-based case-control studies in western Washington state during 1985-1999, comparing proportions of \"switchers\" and \"stoppers\" in cases and controls. We also assessed whether the risk of endometrial cancer in either group of former unopposed estrogen users returned to that of never users. After multivariate adjustment using unconditional logistic regression, women who switched to a combined regimen with a progestin added for at least ten days/month (37 cases, 47 controls) had half the risk of endometrial cancer of women who stopped hormone use altogether (86 cases, 78 controls) (adjusted odds ratio = 0.5, 95% confidence interval: 0.3-1.1). Most subgroups of former users, whether they switched or stopped, had some increased risk of endometrial cancer compared to never users. Results from this study suggest that unopposed estrogen users may reduce their risk of endometrial cancer more by switching to a combined regimen with progestin added for at least ten days/month than by stopping hormone use altogether.", "Role of insulin in growth hormone-stimulated 3T3 cell adipogenesis.\nThe role of insulin during GH-stimulated adipogenesis of 3T3-F442A fibroblasts was investigated. Adipogenesis in defined medium (DM), as quantified by the level of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, revealed that there existed a strict requirement for both insulin and GH during adipogenesis. The concentration of insulin required to elicit half-maximal adipogenesis was approximately 20 nM. Insulin-like growth factor I was less effective than insulin in promoting adipogenesis, indicating that insulin action during differentiation was most likely mediated through the insulin receptor. Cellular viability was not compromised by the absence of insulin, as judged by colony-forming efficiency or trypan blue exclusion. Deletion of insulin from DM supplemented with 1 nM recombinant human GH reduced glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity to uninduced levels. Removal of other individual DM constituents did not have this effect. The growth factors fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and bombesin did not substitute for insulin during GH-stimulated adipogenesis. The characteristic increase in cell number observed during serum-based differentiation, reflecting clonal expansion of young adipocytes, did not occur in DM supplemented with insulin, and insulin-like growth factor I were necessary for this event. These results suggest that insulin functions in concert with GH as a coinducer of the differentiating signals.", "Neuroendocrine and immune interactions with airway macrophages.\nImmune cells, including macrophages, are sources of many cytokines as well as a number of peptide hormones such as corticotropic releasing hormone and the endorphins. These mediators are involved in local immune regulation and may also function in an endocrine manner to influence the systemic hormonal response to stress. In turn, the major effectors of the systemic stress response, namely the glucocorticoids and the catecholamines, have been shown to modulate macrophage function. This review highlights some of what is known about neuroendocrine interactions with macrophages, and in particular, with airway macrophages, as modulation of airway macrophage function by neuroendocrine peptides is likely critical for the maintenance of lung homeostasis. The production of neuromediators (acetylcholine, catecholamines, sensory neuropeptides) and neuropeptide hormones (i.e. adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and beta-endorphin), from airway macrophages is also discussed. We have defined airway macrophages as those cells that reside in the airway compartment (i.e. versus the interstitium) and provide the first line of defence to inhaled particles.", "WEBVTT BRANDI: AND KETV NEWSWATCH 7'S ANDREW OZAKI HAS THE BIG STORY FROM THE STATE CAPITOL.

ANDREW: IN LINCOLN, ANDREW", "Reconstruction of full-thickness cheek defects with using free osseocutaneous radial forearm flap.\nThe aim of the present clinical study was to evaluate the feasibility of free osseocutaneous radial forearm flap in the reconstruction of full-thickness cheek defect after ablative cancer surgery. A retrospective review of data was obtained from consecutive patients requiring free osseocutaneous radial forearm flap to recover both the cutaneous and bone deficit in major full-thickness cheek defect after oncologic resection. Two patients had advanced cheek squamous cell carcinoma. All patients had combined bone and extensive soft-tissue defects. The free osseocutaneous radial forearm flap measuring 10 \u00d7 8 cm to 14 \u00d7 10 cm was used to reconstruct the major through-and-through cheek defects. No major complications occurred in any patient. The patients were followed up for 6 to 20 months; 1 patient was living with no evidence of disease, and 1 had died of local recurrence. The free osseocutaneous radial forearm flap to reconstruct major through-and-through cheek soft tissue and bone defects is reliable and an excellent alternative to other options for patients who have full-thickness defect of cheek.", "Advances in semiconductor processing and logic design have permitted an increase in the amount of logic that may be present on integrated circuit devices. As a result, computer system configurations have evolved from a single or multiple integrated circuits in a system to multiple hardware threads, multiple cores, multiple devices, and/or complete systems on individual integrated circuits. Additionally, as the density of integrated circuits has grown, the power requirements for computing systems (from embedded systems to servers) have also escalated. Furthermore, software inefficiencies, and its requirements of hardware, have also caused an increase in computing device energy consumption. In fact, some studies indicate that computing devices consume a sizeable percentage of the entire electricity supply for a country, such as the United States of America. As a result, there is a vital need for energy efficiency and conservation associated with integrated circuits. These needs will increase as servers, desktop computers, notebooks, Ultrabooks\u2122, tablets, mobile phones, processors, embedded systems, etc. become even more prevalent (from inclusion in the typical computer, automobiles, and televisions to biotechnology).\nIt is known that power consumption is reduced by lowering an operating frequency at which a core runs. However, not only does reduced frequency reduce power consumption, it further reduces performance. Furthermore, very complicated procedures are involved in changing frequencies in a processor.", "The impact of anxiety sensitivity on suicidality in adolescents with major depressive disorder.\nFew studies have examined the link between anxiety sensitivity (AS) and suicidality among adolescents with major depressive disorder; thus, there is a need to explore this relationship in order to fill the research gap. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the association among AS and suicidal behaviour while taking into account the effects of potential third variables such as the presence of anxiety disorders and hopelessness in adolescents with major depressive disorder. Participants (n=101) completed self-report measures of depressive symptoms, AS, hopelessness and suicidal ideation severity. The presence of anxiety disorders and suicide attempt history were determined with psychiatric interviews. The association between psychiatric variables was evaluated using structural equation modelling. Results showed that AS cognitive concerns had a positive effect on suicidal ideation mediated by the severity of depression. AS physical concerns had a negative direct effect on suicidal ideation, but there was also a positive relationship among these variables through hopelessness, thus, the total effect of AS physical concerns was not significant. There were also positive relationships between hopelessness and suicidal ideation, and the presence of anxiety disorders to suicide attempt history. The results of this study suggest that higher AS cognitive concerns may be a risk factor for suicidality through the severity of depression in adolescents who are diagnosed with major depressive disorder.", "Frequent users of pornography. A population based epidemiological study of Swedish male adolescents.\nFrequent use of pornography has not been sufficiently studied before. In a Swedish survey 2015 male students aged 18 years participated. A group of frequent users of pornography (N = 200, 10.5%) were studied with respect to background and psychosocial correlates. The frequent users had a more positive attitude to pornography, were more often \"turned on\" viewing pornography and viewed more often advanced forms of pornography. Frequent use was also associated with many problem behaviours. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that frequent users of pornography were more likely to be living in a large city, consuming alcohol more often, having greater sexual desire and had more often sold sex than other boys of the same age. High frequent viewing of pornography may be seen as a problematic behaviour that needs more attention from both parents and teachers and also to be addressed in clinical interviews.", "Promoter competition assay for analyzing gene regulation in joint tissue engineering.\nWe describe a new biochemical technique, \"promoter competition assay,\" for examining the role of cis-acting DNA elements in tissue cultures. Recent advances in tissue engineering permit the culture of a variety of cells. Many tissues are engineered, however, without an appropriate understanding of molecular machinery that regulates gene expression and cellular growth. For elucidating the role of cis-acting regulatory elements in cellular differentiation and growth, we developed the promoter competition assay. This assay uses a transient transfer into cells of double-stranded DNA fragments consisting of cis-acting regulatory elements. The transferred DNA fragments act as a competitor and titrate the function of their genomic counterparts. Using synovial cells derived from a rheumatoid arthritis patient, we examined a role of NF-kappa B binding sites in the regulation of the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes. The results support a stimulatory role of NF-kappa B in transcriptional regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-13.", "Older workers: an opportunity to expand the long-term care/direct care labor force.\nThis study examined issues related to using older workers in frontline jobs in long-term care from employers' and prospective employees' perspectives. Telephone surveys were conducted with employers representing 615 nursing homes and 410 home health agencies, and 1,091 low-income participants aged 40+ in Operation ABLE employment and training organizations. A total of 696 of these participants were 55 years or older. Low-income older workers were interested in paraprofessional careers in long-term care. More were interested in home health care jobs than working in nursing homes. Job titles that most interested these workers were infrequent in nursing homes. Many workers perceived their health status as sufficient for frontline work. The majority was interested in career advancement opportunities and went to senior centers and places of worship to seek employment. Industry employers had many positive perceptions of older direct care workers, but there were real and perceived deterrents to hiring older workers. The most prominent deterrents were employers' perceptions that older workers have higher health care costs and are less willing to use technology. Policy makers should target Title V funds toward training low-income older workers for long-term care jobs, particularly in using mechanical devices and long-term care technologies. Employment and training organizations should add coursework in long-term care technologies, learn about legal issues in targeting advertising to low-income older workers, and educate employers about ways to reach these prospective employees. Older workers can use information about employers' perceptions when seeking employment.", "Programs, rates, terms and conditions may vary and are subject to change without notice and may be withdrawn at any time.

Those cases due to head injury or brain tumours are excluded from this study. 763 (58.24%) were males and 547 (41.76%) were females. 48.24% were above the age of 60, and there was almost an equal distribution of left and right hemiplegics (642 left hemiplegics and 615 right hemiplegics), with 53 having bilateral stroke. 77.25% of the cases were caused by cerebral thrombosis. 808 (61.68%) cases had hypertension, and 298 (22.75%) cases suffered from diabetes mellitus. After rehabilitation, 89.01% of the cases were ambulant with or without aids or appliances, and 91.91% were either fully independent or partially independent in self-care activities. 95.8% of the patients stayed less than three months in hospital, and 48.09% were able to go home within the first month of hospitalisation. Out of 668 cases who were working before the onset of stroke, 338 (50.60%) could return to gainful employment after their discharge from the hospital.", "Quantitative trait loci mapping of floral and leaf morphology traits in Arabidopsis thaliana: evidence for modular genetic architecture.\nSummary Morphological variation within organisms is integrated and often modular in nature. That is to say, the size and shape of traits tend to vary in a coordinated and structured manner across sets of organs or parts of an organism. The genetic basis of this morphological integration is largely unknown. Here, we report on quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of leaf and floral organ size in Arabidopsis thaliana. We evaluate patterns of genetic correlations among traits and perform whole-genome scans using QTL mapping methods. We detected significant genetic variation for the size and shape of each floral and leaf trait in our study. Moreover, we found large positive genetic correlations among sets of either flower or leaf traits, but low and generally nonsignificant genetic correlations between flower and leaf traits. These results support the hypothesis of independent floral and vegetative modules. We consider co-localization of QTL for different traits as support for a pleiotropic basis of morphological integration and modularity. A total of eight QTL affecting flower and three QTL affecting leaf traits were identified. Most QTL affected either floral or leaf traits, providing a general explanation for high correlations within and low correlations between modules. Only two genomic locations affected both flower and leaf growth. These results are discussed in the context of the evolution of modules, pleiotropy, and the putative homologous relationship between leaves and flowers.", "The effectiveness of Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) training for teachers of children with autism: a pragmatic, group randomised controlled trial.\nTo assess the effectiveness of expert training and consultancy for teachers of children with autism spectrum disorder in the use of the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). Group randomised, controlled trial (3 groups: immediate treatment, delayed treatment, no treatment). 84 elementary school children, mean age 6.8 years. A 2-day PECS workshop for teachers plus 6 half-day, school-based training sessions with expert consultants over 5 months. Rates of: communicative initiations, use of PECS, and speech in the classroom; Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) domain scores for Communication and Reciprocal Social Interaction; scores on formal language tests. Controlling for baseline age, developmental quotient (DQ) and language; rates of initiations and PECS usage increased significantly immediately post-treatment (Odds Ratio (OR) of being in a higher ordinal rate category 2.72, 95% confidence interval 1.22-6.09, p < .05 and OR 3.90 (95%CI 1.75-8.68), p < .001, respectively). There were no increases in frequency of speech, or improvements in ADOS-G ratings or language test scores. The results indicate modest effectiveness of PECS teacher training/consultancy. Rates of pupils' initiations and use of symbols in the classroom increased, although there was no evidence of improvement in other areas of communication. TREATMENT effects were not maintained once active intervention ceased.", "Structure of recombinant Haemophilus influenzae e (P4) acid phosphatase reveals a new member of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily.\nLipoprotein e (P4) from Haemophilus influenzae belongs to the \"DDDD\" superfamily of phosphohydrolases and is the prototype of class C nonspecific acid phosphatases. P4 is also a component of a H. influenzae vaccine. We report the crystal structures of recombinant P4 in the ligand-free and tungstate-inhibited forms, which are the first structures of a class C phosphatase. P4 has a two-domain architecture consisting of a core alpha/beta domain and a smaller alpha domain. The core domain features a five-stranded beta-sheet flanked by helices on both sides that is reminiscent of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily. The alpha domain appears to be unique and plays roles in substrate binding and dimerization. The active site is solvent accessible and located in a cleft between the two domains. The structure shows that P4 is a metalloenzyme and that magnesium is the most likely metal ion in the crystalline recombinant enzyme. The ligands of the metal ion are the carboxyl groups of the first and third Asp residues of the DDDD motif, the backbone carbonyl of the second Asp of the DDDD motif, and two water molecules. The structure of the tungstate-bound enzyme suggests that Asp64 is the nucleophile that attacks the substrate P atom. Dimerization appears to be important for catalysis because intersubunit contacts stabilize the active site. Analysis of the structural context of mutations engineered for vaccine studies shows that the most promising mutations are located in the dimer interface. This observation suggests a structure-based vaccine design strategy in which the dimer interface is disrupted in order to expose epitopes that are buried in dimeric P4.", "Intraoperative prereconstruction arteriography.\nIntraoperative arteriography was performed in 57 patients undergoing arterial reconstructive surgery of the lower extremity prior to selection of the site for the distal anastomosis. In 42 patients (74%), this procedure proved to be of significant benefit. Prereconstructive intraoperative arteriography influenced surgery for seven patients in the following ways: (1) two patients had visualization of vessels not demonstrated on the preoperative arteriogram; and (2) five patients had demonstration of occlusive disease that favored selection of a more distal site of anastomosis. In the remaining 35 patients, the tibial vessels and arch were visualized more clearly, so that the degree and extent of disease were better appreciated. This may have important prognostic significance. On postreconstructive arteriography, an additional five patients were shown to have an anastomotic defect that was corrected in the operating room. Intraoperative arteriography is a rapid, safe, and simple procedure that should be considered as an adjunct in reconstructive surgery of the lower extremity.", "Parental self-efficacy and the management of childhood atopic eczema: development and testing of a new clinical outcome measure.\nEffective parental management of childhood eczema requires education and support to reduce disease severity and improve the child's quality of life. Self-efficacy is a key factor influencing effective chronic disease management, yet there are no published scales to measure parental self-efficacy in managing childhood eczema. The Parental Self-Efficacy with Eczema Care Index (PASECI) was designed to measure parental self-efficacy in managing childhood eczema as a pre- and postintervention tool in the evaluation of a structured Eczema Education Programme (EEP). To develop and test the validity, reliability and sensitivity of a new outcome measure (PASECI) designed to assess parental self-efficacy in managing their child's eczema to determine pre- vs. postintervention changes in educational intervention evaluation studies. PASECI was developed from the literature, expert consultation and piloting of a 40-item prototype. The final 29-item scale is arranged in four subscales. Parents of children with eczema aged 0-16 years (n = 242) attending the EEP were assessed at 1 week pre-EEP and 4 weeks postintervention. Cronbach's \u03b1 and factor analyses were undertaken. PASECI has face, content and construct validity. It is reliable, with high item internal consistency (\u03b1 > 0\u00b787 in all domains). Factor analysis revealed four viable domains. It was sensitive to change for postintervention measures using sign tests (P < 0\u00b7001). PASECI is a useful, valid, reliable and sensitive evaluative outcome measure of self-efficacy in parents managing childhood eczema.", "Quality assurance audit in an Australasian phase III trial of accelerated radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (TROG 91.01). Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group.\nThe Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) initiated a randomized trial, testing accelerated (twice daily) radiotherapy against conventional radiotherapy for stage III and stage IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in 1991. In 1996, the Trial Management Committee arranged for a technical audit of 76 cases from 11 institutions, conducted by investigators from interstate institutions. A 10% unacceptable protocol violation rate was detected, which compares favourably with initial Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) experience in the late 1970s. Infrastructural deficits with poor quality of documentation, incomplete retrieval of films and document return have been demonstrated in some cases. The Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group is actively pursuing procedural and resourcing issues in order to redress this and is actively expanding its Quality Assurance (QA) Programme with an intercentre dosimetry study. Ultimately, comprehensive clinical and technical QA site visits are planned.", "Relationship between inpatient alcoholism treatment and longitudinal changes in health care utilization.\nThe purpose of the study was to evaluate changes in health care utilization associated with inpatient alcoholism treatment in alcoholics of low socioeconomic status with different histories of treatment relapse. The sample consisted of more than 85,000 male alcoholics using inpatient care in Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers in fiscal year 1987. Five treatment groups were identified to represent a continuum of length and intensity of alcoholism treatment, including formal inpatient alcoholism treatment, short detoxification and hospitalizations for primary diagnoses other than alcoholism. All inpatient and outpatient health services for 3 years before and 3 years after the index hospitalization were examined for differential changes in utilization associated with the five treatment groups after controlling for patient predisposing, enabling and need characteristics. Both total inpatient days and outpatient visits increased significantly for all treatment groups, with the greatest increases occurring in the group completing inpatient alcoholism treatment (both p < .0001). However, use of inpatient medical care decreased and substance abuse inpatient care increased significantly for most groups, with the largest increases in substance abuse care found for the completed treatment group. In a hospital system that does not deny care on the basis of ability to pay, certain groups of chronic alcoholics who cannot sustain prolonged remission will continue to be heavy utilizers of services. Alcoholism treatment may be associated with higher short-term costs but it remains to be seen whether provision of more focused treatment services is able to achieve longer term better outcomes and, ultimately, lower costs.", "Effect of Saraca asoca (Asoka) on estradiol-induced keratinizing metaplasia in rat uterus.\nEstrogen-mediated uterus endometrium instability is considered as one of the etiological factors in dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) and uterine cancer. Saraca asoca (Family: Fabaceae) and its fermented preparation, Asokarishta, are extensively used as uterine tonic to treat gynecological disorders in Ayurveda. The present study evaluated the effect of S. asoca (Asoka) on estrogen-induced endometrial thickening of rat uterus. Endometrial thickening was induced by intraperitoneal injection of estradiol (20 \u03bcg/kg b.wt) to 8-day-old immature rats for alternate 5 days. Methanolic extract (200 mg/kg b. wt) from S. asoca bark was given orally along with estradiol. Uterus endometrial thickening was analyzed histopathologically and serum estrogen level by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Cyclooxygenase (COX-2) expression in rat uterus was also estimated by Western blot. Anti-inflammatory activity of the extract was analyzed by formalin- and carrageenan-elicited paw edema models in mouse. Uterus endometrium proliferation and keratinized metaplasia with seven to eight stratified epithelial layers on day 16 was observed in rats administered with estradiol. Treatment with S. asoca reduced the thickening to two to four layers and the serum estrogen level diminished significantly to 82.9\u00b112.87 pg/mL compared to rats administered with estrogen alone (111.2\u00b110.68 pg/mL). A reduction of formalin- and carrageenan-induced paw edema in mouse by S. asoca extract was observed. Lower level of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced COX-2 enzyme in rat uterus by the extract further confirms its anti-inflammatory activity. Present study reveals the antiproliferative and antikeratinizing effects of S. asoca in uterus endometrium possibly through its anti-estrogenic and anti-inflammatory properties.", "The distribution of lead within ancient and modern human teeth: implications for long-term and historical exposure monitoring.\nThe preservation of lead within human tissue makes it possible to monitor long-term exposure to the element and to model changing sources of lead pollution throughout the lifetime of an individual. Dental tissues have recently been shown to be particularly useful for this purpose. Enamel, for instance, forms at known stages of life and is chemically stable in vivo whereas dentine is remodelled in a predictable fashion. The relative stability of enamel is reflected in its excellent post-mortem preservation. This raises the possibility of using historical or archaeological material to reconstruct long-term trends and establish baseline data relating to exposure among pre-industrial or even prehistoric populations. The use of archaeological material is currently problematic, however, because of the site-specific nature of diagenesis and incomplete understanding of its chemistry, particularly in respect of lead uptake into dental tissue from the burial environment. A detailed study of lead distribution within both ancient and modern human teeth is presented. Conclusions are drawn on the pattern of lead distribution resulting from tissue formation and the manner of its alteration in the burial environment. In particular, attention is drawn to a consistent enrichment of lead within the outer 30 microns of the enamel of both ancient and modern teeth which appears to be unrelated to diagenesis. The implications for current approaches to long-term monitoring and for the reconstruction of historical and archaeological exposure patterns are discussed.", "Particle size modeling and morphology study of chitosan/gelatin/nanohydroxyapatite nanocomposite microspheres for bone tissue engineering.\nIn this study, nanocomposite microspheres based on chitosan/gelatin/nanohydroxyapatite were fabricated, and effects of the nanohydroxyapatite/biopolymer (chitosan/gelatin) weight ratio (nHA/P), stirring rate, chitosan concentration and biopolymer concentration on the particle size, and morphology of nanocomposite microspheres were investigated. Particle size of microspheres was modeled by design of experiments using the surface response method. Particle size, morphology of microspheres, and distribution of nanoparticles within the composite microspheres were evaluated using an optical microscope, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were applied to study the physical and chemical characteristics of microspheres. Results showed that by modulating the nHA/P ratio, chitosan concentration, polymer concentration, and stirring rate, it is possible to fabricate microspheres in wide rages of particle size (5-150 \u03bcm). Analysis of variance confirmed that the modified quadratic model can be used to predict the particle size of nanocomposite microspheres within the design space. SEM studies showed that microspheres with different compositions had totally different morphologies from dense morphologies to porous ones. TEM images demonstrated that nanoparticles were distributed uniformly within the polymeric matrix. MTT assay and cell culture studies showed that microspheres with different compositions possessed good biocompatibility. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A, 2013.", "Culture of autopsy-derived fibroblasts as a tool to study systemic alterations in human neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease--methodological investigations.\nThe present study was undertaken in order to analyse the possibility of culturing post mortem derived human fibroblasts. The combination of post mortem fibroblasts with the autopsy proven and histopathologically staged brain will allow the correlative investigation of dynamic biochemical processes which are systemically underlying or accompanying a neurological and/or psychiatric disorder. These studies are limited in autopsy brain or are uncertain when the neuropathological status is lacking, i.e. when fibroblasts were obtained from living patients. Our examinations of human autopsy fibroblast and those under experimentally controlled post mortem conditions with rats clearly demonstrate that autopsy-derived fibroblasts can be reliably cultured. The cells grown displayed typical morphological and staining characteristics as well as pharmacological responsiveness. Even cells obtained from a 99 years old individual or an individual with a post mortem delay of 48 hours grew in our culture system.", "site-toolshttp://pregame.com/site-tools/default.aspxHow to use special features on pregame.comen-US7.x ProductionPage: More Site Toolshttp://pregame.com/site-tools/p/more-site-tools.aspxMon, 17 Feb 2014 02:02:00 GMTb99575bc-4fda-4d0b-a780-474f53a1f57e:9dbae744-0002-420e-b031-9eff138676e7Unknown Pregame.com Instructions for setting Us as your homepage For most browsers: Just drag and drop this link onto the Home icon in your browser.

Subscales of autonomy, control over the practice setting, nurse-physician relationship and organizational support were incorporated into the analysis to determine which aspects of work environment directly affect the intent to leave the profession. An explanatory cross-sectional survey was distributed to 259 direct care bedside RNs employed at a rural system-affiliated hospital in Central Florida between February 2007 and June 2007. Anonymity was assured. A questionnaire containing demographic questions, the Nursing Work Index-Revised and Blau's intent to leave scale was distributed to all direct care nurses. A 32.8% response rate was achieved for a total of 85 complete and usable surveys. Data analysis shows that the work environment in general is negatively related to intent to leave. In addition, each of the four subscales was also negatively related to the intent to leave the profession. The results of this study support several recommendations for practice and education, including the promotion of professional practice environments, fostering inter-departmental relationships, and increasing the managerial training of RN managers.", "Identification of MHC class II-restricted peptide ligands, including a glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 sequence, that stimulate diabetogenic T cells from transgenic BDC2.5 nonobese diabetic mice.\nNonobese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop insulitis and destruction of pancreatic islet beta cells similar to type 1 diabetes mellitis in humans. Insulitis also occurs in the BDC2.5 TCR transgenic line of NOD mice that express the rearranged TCR alpha- and beta-chain genes of a diabetogenic NOD CD4 T cell clone. When activated with syngeneic islet cells in culture, BDC2.5 T cells adoptively transfer disease to NOD recipients, but the identity of the islet cell Ag responsible for pathogenicity is not known. To characterize the autoantigen(s) involved, BDC2.5 T cells were used to screen a combinatorial peptide library arranged in a positional scanning format. We identified more than 100 decapeptides that stimulate these T cells at nanomolar concentrations; they are then capable of transferring disease to NOD-scid mice. Surprisingly, some of the peptides include sequences similar (8 of 10 residues) to those found within the 528-539 fragment of glutamic acid decarboxylase 65. Although this 12-mer glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 fragment is only slightly stimulatory for BDC2.5 T cells (EC(50) > 100 microM), a larger 16-mer fragment, 526-541, shows activity in the low micromolar range (EC(50) = 2.3 microM). Finally, T cells from prediabetic NOD mice respond spontaneously to these peptide analogs in culture; this finding validates them as being related to a critical autoantigen involved in the etiology of spontaneous diabetes and indicates that their further characterization is important for a better understanding of underlying disease mechanisms.", "Alternative complement pathway-dependent ingestion of fluolite particles by human granulocytes.\nFluorescent particles (Fluolite) with an average size of 0.1 micrometers were ingested by human granulocytes after incubation in fresh normal human serum (NHS). Ingestion was assessed by visual counting in a fluorescent microscope of cells containing particles. Ingestion required fresh normal serum and did not occur when serum was heated for 30 min at 50 degrees C or in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). It did not occur in serum genetically deficient in C3b inactivator or in C3. Phagocytic activity was restored to C3-deficient serum by purified human C3 and to heat inactivated serum by purified factor B. Opsonic activity was present in NHS containing 5 mM Mg++ and 10 mM ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid (EGTA) and in human serum genetically deficient in human C components C2 and C5. Agammaglobulinemic sera had normal opsonic activity. Opsonization of particles in this system is mediated through the alternative pathway of C activation, and its measurement serves as a simple quantitative functional assay for this system.", "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the safety of the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in pregnancy. We carried out a retrospective cohort study of 972 pregnant women who had been given at least 1 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor prescription in the year before delivery and 3878 pregnant women who did not receive selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and who were matched by the year of the infant's birth, the type of institute at birth, and the mother's postal code from 1990 to 2000 in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The risks of low birth weight (adjusted odds ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.19, 2.11), preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.28, 1.92), fetal death (adjusted odds ratio, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.01, 4.93), and seizures (adjusted odds ratio, 3.87; 95% CI, 1.00, 14.99) were increased in infants who were born to mothers who had received selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor therapy. The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in pregnancy may increase the risks of low birth weight, preterm birth, fetal death, and seizures.", "Delayed vaccination does not improve antibody responses in splenectomized rats experiencing hypovolemic shock.\nDelayed vaccination after splenectomy has been shown to increase the antibody response in normotensive rats. The purpose of this experiment was to study the effect of timing of vaccination on antibody responses in rats undergoing splenectomy and experiencing hypovolemic shock. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250 to 400 g underwent either a sham abdominal surgery or splenectomy after a 30-minute period of controlled hypovolemic shock. All rats then received pneumococcal vaccinations one day, 7 days, or 28 days postoperatively. Antibody levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3 weeks after vaccination. Results were compared by analysis of variance. Animals vaccinated one day postoperatively had similar or higher antibody responses than did rats receiving delayed vaccinations after 7 or 28 days. These results were similar for immunoglobulins G and M and more importantly were consistent for animals undergoing splenectomy and sham operations. Delayed vaccinations failed to improve antibody responses when hypovolemic shock preceded splenectomy. We propose that this is the result of complex cytokine responses to hypovolemic shock. These responses have been studied extensively in the setting of septic shock but not in the setting of hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock.", "Dynamics of light-induced activation in the PAS domain proteins LOV2 and PYP probed by time-resolved tryptophan fluorescence.\nLight-induced activation of the LOV2-J\u03b1 domain of the photoreceptor phototropin from oat is believed to involve the detachment of the J\u03b1 helix from the central \u03b2-sheet and its subsequent unfolding. The dynamics of these conformational changes were monitored by time-resolved emission spectroscopy with 100 ns time resolution. Three transitions were detected during the LOV2-J\u03b1 photocycle with time constants of 3.4 \u03bcs, 500 \u03bcs, and 4.3 ms. The fastest transition is due to the decay of the flavin phosphorescence in the transition of the triplet LOV(L)(660) state to the singlet LOV(S)(390) signaling state. The 500 \u03bcs and 4.3 ms transitions are due to changes in tryptophan fluorescence and may be associated with the dissociation and unfolding of the J\u03b1 helix, respectively. They are absent in the transient absorption signal of the flavin chromophore. The tryptophan fluorescence signal monitors structural changes outside the chromophore binding pocket and indicates that there are at least three LOV(S)(390) intermediates. Since the 500 \u03bcs and 4.3 ms components are absent in a construct without the J\u03b1 helix and in the mutant W557S, the fluorescence signal is mainly due to tryptophan 557. The kinetics of the main 500 \u03bcs component is strongly temperature dependent with activation energy of 18.2 kcal/mol suggesting its association with a major structural change. In the structurally related PAS domain protein PYP the N-terminal cap dissociates from the central \u03b2-sheet and unfolds upon signaling state formation with a similar time constant of \u223c1 ms. Using transient fluorescence we obtained a nearly identical activation energy of 18.5 kcal/mol for this transition.", "Comparing the interobserver reproducibility of different regions of interest on multi-parametric renal magnetic resonance imaging in healthy volunteers, patients with heart failure and renal transplant recipients.\nTo assess interobserver reproducibility of different regions of interest (ROIs) on multi-parametric renal MRI using commercially available software. Healthy volunteers (HV), patients with heart failure (HF) and renal transplant recipients (Tx) were recruited. Localiser scans, T1 mapping and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling (pCASL) were performed. HV and Tx also underwent diffusion-weighted imaging to allow calculation of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). For T1, pCASL and ADC, ROIs were drawn for whole kidney (WK), cortex (Cx), user-defined representative cortex (rep-Cx) and medulla. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CoV) were assessed. Forty participants were included (10 HV, 10 HF and 20 Tx). The ICC for renal volume was 0.97 and CoV 6.5%. For T1 and ADC, WK, Cx, and rep-Cx were highly reproducible with ICC \u2265 0.76 and CoV < 5%. However, cortical pCASL results were more variable (ICC > 0.86, but CoV up to 14.2%). While reproducible, WK values were derived from a wide spread of data (ROI standard deviation 17% to 55% of the mean value for ADC and pCASL, respectively). Renal volume differed between groups (p < 0.001), while mean cortical T1 values were greater in Tx compared to HV (p = 0.009) and HF (p = 0.02). Medullary T1 values were also higher in Tx than HV (p = 0.03), while medullary pCASL values were significantly lower in Tx compared to HV and HF (p = 0.03 for both). Kidney volume calculated by manually contouring a localiser scan was highly reproducible between observers and detected significant differences across patient groups. For T1, pCASL and ADC, Cx and rep-Cx ROIs are generally reproducible with advantages over WK values.", "Diphenylamine-Substituted Osmanaphthalyne Complexes: Structural, Bonding, and Redox Properties of Unusual Donor-Bridge-Acceptor Systems.\nDiarylamine-substituted osmanaphthalyne complexes that feature two redox centers linked by the rigid skeleton of the metallacycle (C^C+ ), specifically, [OsCl2 (PPh3 )2 {(C^C+ )NAr2 }][BF4 - ] (Ar=Ph (1 a), p-MeOPh (1 b)) and their open-ring precursors [OsHCl2 (PPh3 )2 {(\u2261C-C(PPh3 + )=CHPh)NR2 }][BF4 - ] (Ar=Ph (2 a), p-MeOPh (2 b)), were successfully synthesized and characterized by 1 H, 13 C, and 31 P NMR spectroscopy, ESI-MS, and elemental analysis. The solid-state molecular structures of complexes 1 a and 2 a were ascertained by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The Os\u2261C bond length in both complexes 1 a and 2 a fell within the range reported for similar osmanaphthalynes and osmium carbyne complexes, respectively. The structural parameters determined for complex 1 a, which were successfully reproduced by theoretical calculations, point to a \u03c0-delocalized metallacycle structure. The purple color of compounds 1 a and b was explained by the diarylamine\u2192Os(metallacycle) charge-transfer absorption in the visible region. The neutral, one-electron-oxidized and one-electron-reduced states of compounds 1 a, b, and a reference complex that lacked the diarylamine substituent, [OsCl2 (PPh3 )2 {(C^C+ )}][BF4 - ] (1'), were investigated by cyclic and square-wave voltammetry, UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemistry, and DFT calculations. The spin density in singly oxidized complexes [1 a]+ and [1 b]+ predominantly resided on the aminyl segment, with osmium involvement controlled by the diphenylamine substitution. Spin density in stable, singly-reduced [1']- was distributed mainly over the osmanaphthalyne metallacycle.", "Cost-effective management of acute atrial fibrillation: role of rate control, spontaneous conversion, medical and direct current cardioversion, transesophageal echocardiography, and antiembolic therapy.\nManagement strategies for the acute treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) include: (1) the use of intravenous drugs for rate control, (2) drug termination, or (3) direct current (DC) cardioversion. Delays in cardioversion can promote atrial remodeling and add thromboembolic risk. Rate control awaiting spontaneous or pharmacologic conversion may be a cost-effective strategy in patients presenting with recent onset of symptoms. Early DC cardioversion can be cost-effective and minimize antiembolic therapy issues in the acute setting. In patients presenting with AF of unknown or >48 hours' duration, rate control and therapeutic warfarin for 3-4 weeks followed by medical or DC cardioversion is standard practice. However, delays in conversion promote atrial remodeling that makes restoration of sinus rhythm more difficult and increases the likelihood of postcardioversion AF recurrence. Transesophageal echocardiography can identify patients at low risk for a cardioversion-related embolic event and allows cardioversion to be performed earlier, thereby minimizing atrial remodeling.", "Analysis of the contributing factors to airway hyperresponsiveness by a forced oscillation technique in patients with asthma.\nForced oscillation technique (FOT) is increasingly used to obtain much information on the state of the respiratory system. However, there are little data about FOT parameters on methacholine provocation test in adult asthma. This study was designed to determine the physiological implications of FOT parameters during methacholine provocation and analyze the major contributing factors to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in asthma. Spirometry and FOT were performed in 22 asthmatic patients and 21 normal control subjects before and after provocation with a maximal dose of methacholine. In asthmatic patients, the percent increase in resistance at 5 Hz (R5) and resistance at 20 Hz (R20) after the methacholine provocation was 70 [45-93] % and 16 [5-23] %. The percent change in R20 was not significantly correlated with the percent change in FVC or FEV1. Similarly, the percent change in R5 was not significantly correlated with the percent change in FEV1, but was significantly correlated with the percent change in FVC. Moreover, the percent change in R5 was significantly correlated with the closing index (r = 0.55, p = 0.01). In addition, AHR to methacholine was closely correlated with the percent change in R5 (r = -0.71, p = 0.001). Simultaneous measurement of FOT and bronchial challenge test provide meaningful information, and greater change in R5 may represent exaggerated response of small airways in asthmatic patients. This study will provide new insights into the physiological implications of each FOT parameter in asthmatic patients.", "Barriers to postoperative pain management in hip fracture patients with dementia as evaluated by nursing staff.\nThis paper reports a study of the perceptions of nursing staff regarding barriers to postoperative pain management in hip fracture patients with dementia, their expectations, and facilitators offered by their employers to overcome these barriers. Patients with dementia are at high risk for insufficient postoperative pain treatment, mainly owing to inability to articulate or convey their pain experience. Nursing staff have an essential role in the treatment and care of patients who are vulnerable, and therefore unable to advocate for their own pain treatment. Questionnaires with both structured and open-ended questions were used to collect data from nursing staff members in seven university hospitals and ten city-center hospitals from March to May 2011. The response rate was 52% (n = 331). According to nursing staff, the biggest barrier in pain management was the difficulty in assessing pain owing to a patient's cognitive impairment (86%). Resisting care and restlessness among patients with dementia can lead to use of restraints, although these kinds of behavioral changes can point to the occurrence of pain. There were statistically significant differences between the sufficiency of pain management and barriers. Those who expected pain management to be insufficient identified more barriers than those who expected pain management to be sufficient (p < .001). Further updating education for nursing staff in pain detection and management is needed so that nursing staff are also able to recognize behavioral symptoms as potential signs of pain and provide appropriate pain management.", "Properties of glutamatergic synapses in immature layer Vb pyramidal neurons: coupling of pre- and postsynaptic maturational states.\nFollowing initial contact formation, glutamatergic synapses in cortical neurons undergo pronounced functional maturation. These maturational events, occurring both pre- and postsynaptically, have been well described in the developing hippocampus. In this paper, we characterized glutamatergic synapses in immature layer Vb pyramidal neurons of the mouse somatosensory cortex during early postnatal development. At postnatal day 7, a significant subpopulation of glutamatergic synapses exhibited a low release probability that was accompanied by strong paired-pulse facilitation of AMPA EPSCs (paired-pulse ratio C > or = 2). Increasing extracellular Ca(2+) concentration increased release probability and led to paired-pulse depression. During further postnatal development, these functionally immature synapses disappeared. As shown pharmacologically,these synapses expressed postsynaptic NMDA receptors containing NR2B subunits, while NMDA receptors with NR2A subunits were lacking. Taken together, a low release probability presynaptically was coupled to postsynaptic NR2B signaling. This subpopulation of neocortical synapses thus differed from the majority of synapses in the developing hippocampus, where high release probability is coupled to NR2B signaling. The novel type of functionally immature glutamatergic synapse described here might play an important role in early developmental synapse elimination and in the activity-dependent refinement of the neocortical synaptic microcircuitry.", "Ultrastructural analysis of germinal centers in lymph nodes of patients with HIV-1-induced persistent generalized lymphadenopathy: evidence for persistence of infection.\nGerminal centers play an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1-induced lymphadenopathy. Cell-free retrovirus particles, gag proteins of HIV-1, and cells expressing viral RNA can be detected in these areas of the lymph node. In the present study, the ultrastructural changes and the interactions of virus with different cell types of the germinal centers were investigated. We compared the alterations of lymph nodes obtained shortly after seroconversion with those seen in longstanding lymphadenopathy. The results demonstrated that germinal centers were already infected in the early phase of the disease. However, the number of cell free virions was low. During the course of the disease, large amounts of cell free virions accumulated in the germinal centers. The persistence of germinal center infection for up to 2 years was demonstrated by detecting retrovirus particles in repeated biopsy specimens. In addition, the presence of numerous small, moderately electron dense structures that might represent defective particles of HIV-1 and influence the course of the disease were described. HIV-1 was found to replicate in lymphocytes, macrophages, and follicular dendritic cells. Quite possibly, a genomic shift may occur at the time of transmission of the virus to a novel target cell, thus, germinal centers may be one of the anatomic sites where HIV-1 acquires the ability to develop into a variant with preferential tropism for a given cell type.", "Adolescent immunizations and other clinical preventive services: a needle and a hook?\nAdvances in technology have led to development of new vaccines for adolescents, but these vaccines will be added to a crowded schedule of recommended adolescent clinical preventive services. We reviewed adolescent clinical preventive health care guidelines and patterns of adolescent clinical preventive service delivery and assessed how new adolescent vaccines might affect health care visits and the delivery of other clinical preventive services. Our analysis suggests that new adolescent immunization recommendations are likely to improve adolescent health, both as a \"needle\" and a \"hook.\" As a needle, the immunization will enhance an adolescent's health by preventing vaccine-preventable diseases during adolescence and adulthood. It also will likely be a hook to bring adolescents (and their parents) into the clinic for adolescent health care visits, during which other clinical preventive services can be provided. We also speculate that new adolescent immunization recommendations might increase the proportion and quality of other clinical preventive services delivered during health care visits. The factor most likely to diminish the positive influence of immunizations on delivery of other clinical preventive services is the additional visit time required for vaccine counseling and administration. Immunizations may \"crowd out\" delivery of other clinical preventive services during visits or reduce the quality of the clinical preventive service delivery. Complementary strategies to mitigate these effects might include prioritizing clinical preventive services with a strong evidence base for effectiveness, spreading clinical preventive services out over several visits, and withholding selected clinical preventive services during a visit if the prevention activity is effectively covered at the community level. Studies are needed to evaluate the effect of new immunizations on adolescent preventive health care visits, delivery of clinical preventive services, and health outcomes.", "Since the introduction of chromosomal banding techniques in the early 1970's, numerous tumors have been associated with specific chromosomal defects. Prezygotic chromosomal deletions have been causally related to two specific childhood tumors (retinoblastoma and Wilm's), while a large number of hematopoietic neoplasms have been associated with site-specific translocations or complete or partial monosomy. Less is known about the chromosome abnormalities of solid tumors because it has been technically difficult to obtain chromosome preparations from them. As a result of recent improvements in cytogenetic techniques, there is now also evidence for specific changes in solid tumors. The major role of the Cytogenetics Core will be to prepare karyotypes from the tumors provided by the Tumor Procurement Core, and to coordinate the established and distribution of explant cultures of these tumors with matched normal control tissues for the appropriate investigators. The data on the tumor karyotypes will also be provided to the Tumor Procurement/Data Management Core. These studies should add to the growing body of knowledge regarding nonrandom cytogenetic changes in pediatric solid tumors and their utility in diagnosis.", "Prevalence and risk factors of alcohol abuse among university students from eastern Croatia: questionnaire study.\nThe aim of the study was to examine the prevalence of alcohol abuse among university students in Osijek, Croatia and its possible interconnections with gender, year of study, repetition of year of study, faculty subject area, sources of financing and type of residence during study. A validated questionnaire was self-administered to cross-faculty representative student sample of \"J. J. Strossmayer\" University of Osiek in June 2006. General demographic data, as well as data on academic features and student socio-economical status were obtained. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was used for assessing the extent of alcohol consumption, with cut off value of 8 indicating possible alcohol problems. The majority of study participants 90.9% (755/831) had tried alcohol at least once in their life. Among this group, 43.8% (331/755) had an AUDIT total score of 8 or more: 69.2% (229/331) were males and 30.8% (102/331) were females. Among the study participants who screened positive, 70.4% (233/331) responded positively to simple advice focused on the reduction of hazardous drinking (AUDIT 8-15), 14.5% (48/331) needed brief counseling and continued monitoring (AUDIT 16-19), and 15.1% (50/331) clearly warranted further diagnostic evaluation for alcohol dependence (AUDIT 20 and above). Significantly different statistical data was found within the following factors: gender, repetition of year of study, faculty subject area and type of residence (chi2 = 76.232, p = 0.0000; Fisher exact test = 31.828, p = 0.0000; chi2 = 11.667, p = 0.0086 and chi2 = 6.639, p = 0.0362 respectively). Alcohol consumption resulting in risk behaviors is common among university students from eastern Croatia. These findings emphasize the need for comprehensive and effective preventative strategies directed towards student population.", "Virus elimination during the recycling of chromatographic columns used during the manufacture of coagulation factors.\nVarious chromatographic procedures are used during the purification and manufacture of plasma products such as coagulation factors. These steps contribute to the overall safety of such products by removing potential virus contamination. Virus removal by two affinity chromatography procedures, i.e. monoclonal antibody chromatography and metal chelate chromatography (immobilised metal ion affinity chromatography), used during the manufacture of the high purity factor VIII (Replenate\u00ae) and factor IX (Replenine\u00ae-VF), respectively, has been investigated. In addition, as these columns are recycled after use, the effectiveness of the sanitisation procedures for preventing possible cross-contamination, has also been investigated. Both chromatographic steps proved effective for eliminating a range of model enveloped and non-enveloped viruses by 4 to >6 and 5 to >8 log for the monoclonal and metal chelate columns, respectively. The effectiveness of the relatively mild column sanitisation conditions used, i.e. ethanol for factor IX and acetic acid for factor VIII, was confirmed using non-spiked column runs. The chemicals used contributed to virus elimination by inactivation and/or by physical removal of the virus. In summary, these studies demonstrate that potential virus contamination between chromatographic runs can be prevented when an effective column recycling and sanitisation procedure is included.", "Comparison of designed slippers splints with the splints available on the market in the treatment of hallux valgus.\nHallux valgus or the lateral deviation of the great toe is a complex disease. If it is not treated, it will cause the deviation of other toes. Hallux valgus is three times more common in females and may cause uncomfortable deformity of the foot, problems in putting on unsuitable and narrow toe box shoes, and pain on the medial side of the first metatarsophalangeal joint; therefore, patients seek medical services. Untreated hallux valgus may cause the hammer toe deformity of the second toe. In this cohort study, 30 patients referring to the Orthopedic Clinic of Shohada Ashayer Hospital of Khorramabad, Iran, with a complaint of hallux valgus were randomly divided into two groups. The splints designed by the researches (slippers splints) were given to the case group, and the splints on the market including night splints and interdigital pads were given to the control group. The patients were followed every three months for a year and every time the weight bearing anteroposterior radiography of both feet were taken and hallux valgus and inter-metatarsal angles were measured. The data was analyzed by the SPSS software using repeated measure tests. In the case group that used the designed splints regularly, hallux valgus angles decreased more dramatically than in the control group (P<0.001). This study showed that, despite controversies over the nonoperative treatment of hallux valgus, if hallux valgus angle in patient is mild to moderate, the splint can be used as a nonoperative treatment.", "Albumin-bilirubin grade may determine the outcomes of patients with very early stage hepatocellular carcinoma after radiofrequency ablation therapy.\nTo assess long-term prognoses of patients with solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) < 2 cm (the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer, BCLC stage 0) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA). We retrospectively enrolled 271 patients with BCLC stage 0 HCC who had undergone RFA at Taipei Veterans General Hospital from 2002 to 2016. Factors determining poor overall survival (OS) and recurrence after RFA were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards model. After a median follow-up duration of 43.4 months, 76 patients had died. The cumulative 5- and 10-year OS rates were 67.1% and 56.4%, respectively. Multivariate analysis disclosed age > 65 years (hazard ratio [HR] 1.608, 95% confidence interval, [CI] 1.015-2.545; p = 0.043), platelet count < 100,000/mm (HR 1.704, 95% CI 1.027-2.828; p = 0.039), and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade 2 or 3 (HR 2.191, 95% CI 1.261-3.805; p = 0.005) were the independent risk factors predicting worse OS. One-hundred twelve patients had tumor recurrence after undergoing RFA. Multivariate analysis showed that ALBI grade 2 or 3 (HR 1.825, 95% CI 1.288-2.585; p = 0.001) was the only one independent risk factor associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS) after RFA. Most of the subgroup analyses also demonstrated that patients with ALBI grade 2 or 3 had poorer OS and RFS than those with ALBI grade 1. For patients with BCLC stage 0 HCC, RFA could provide a long-term outcome with a 10-year overall survival rate of 56.4%. Moreover, the ALBI grade can discriminate prognosis in such patients.", "Levels of human cytomegalovirus miR-US25-1-5p and miR-UL112-3p in serum extracellular vesicles from infants with HCMV active infection are significantly correlated with liver damage.\nHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can incorporate miRNAs. Relationship between HCMV infection and miRNAs in EVs remains unknown. EVs were isolated from supernatants of human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HELF) cells. Profiles of miRNAs in EVs were analyzed by deep sequencing. Dynamics of candidate viral miRNAs transportation via EVs was investigated using TaqMan PCR. Levels of candidate viral miRNAs in serum EVs from infants with HCMV active infection were detected and analyzed with their clinical index levels. A total of 16 HCMV miRNAs were found in EVs from infected HELF. Levels of miR-US25-1-5p and miR-UL112-3p in EVs increased at 6 h post-infection and were correlated with those in cells (for miR-US25-1-5p: r2 = 0.9375, p value < 0.05; for miR-UL112-3p: r2 = 0.7557, p value < 0.05). Viral miRNAs were transported into recipient cells at 2 h post-incubation. Moreover, levels of miR-US25-1-5p in serum EVs showed positive correlations with serum levels of \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, direct bilirubin, and total bile acid. Levels of miR-UL112-3p in serum EVs showed a positive correlation with serum levels of direct bilirubin. HCMV miRNAs could be transported to uninfected cells via EVs. Levels of miR-US25-1-5p and miR-UL112-3p in serum EVs from infants with HCMV active infection were significantly correlated with liver damage.", "Action of ethanol low doses on heart rate variability following intravenous administration in rabbits.\nEffects of low ethanol doses on the vagosympathetic mechanisms of heart rate regulation were studied in rabbits. Analysis of heart rate variability showed that single intravenous administration of 0.5 mg/kg ethanol caused a higher probability of heart electrophysiological instability in sympathicotonics in contrast to vagotonics. This was associated with activation of the whole complex of regulatory mechanisms. In vagotonics, perturbations in power spectrum indicated on rapidly shunting of regulatory activity from lower to high levels of regulatory mechanisms to realize a \"first class\" undifferentiated response on stress induction. Sympathicotonics were unready to ethanol intravenous administration that resulted in reduction of all spectral component. Intravenous administration of ethanol caused a higher probability of heart electrophysiological instability in sympathicotonics then in vagotonics. It is important to consider these differences for therapeutic application of ethanol to some acute poisoning (methyl alcohol, ethylene glycol).", "Multimodality monitoring and telemonitoring in neurocritical care: from microdialysis to robotic telepresence.\nThis review will highlight the state-of-the-art in brain monitoring in neurointensive care and define methods of integrating this technology into patient care using telemedicine methods. Several new methods of brain monitoring have been established over the last several years including continuous EEG monitoring, brain tissue oxygenation, jugular venous oxygenation, and cerebral microdialysis. Observational research using these monitors has documented that the brain metabolism, blood flow and function are dynamic after a primary insult. The dynamic nature of the brain can predispose the brain to secondary insults that can occur in the setting of intensive care. Several variables of brain metabolism and function can be monitored and directly impact treatment decisions as well as provide diagnostic and prognostic information. General treatment guidelines for brain injury and brain hemorrhage were developed, in part, prior to implementation of use of these monitors, and there is a trend away from adoption of a one-size-fits-all approach and a trend towards monitor-guided therapy. Dealing with the data provided by multimodality monitoring can be overwhelming. Efficient use of such information requires methods to integrate diverse sets of information, and methods to access the online monitoring information remotely and at any time, day or night. Such remote access integration methods will be reviewed. Multimodality and telemedicine techniques have advanced the state of knowledge about brain function in critically ill patients, and are presently being implemented to direct therapy. Increasing complexity of care will become commonplace, but will be facilitated by computer-enhanced tools that permit the intensivist to integrate this information into an improved treatment regimen.", "Endothelin-1 as an aggravating factor of disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with malignant neoplasms.\nVascular endothelial damage may play an important role in the pathophysiology of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a frequent complication of malignant neoplasms. It may mediate a variety of triggering events to initiate DIC and platelet aggregation, which in turn leads to additional endothelial destruction. If so, endothelin-1 (ET-1), the most potent vasoconstrictor of naturally occurring pressor substances known, may leak from injured endothelial cells and aggravate the disease process. The study included 36 patients with various malignant neoplasms in whom DIC developed. The authors measured plasma levels of ET-1 and big ET-1, a precursor peptide of ET-1, in these patients and compared them with other laboratory abnormalities during the course of DIC. Plasma ET-1 and big ET-1 levels were elevated in most patients with DIC. When compared with the results of other diagnostic tests, elevated plasma big ET-1 was the most frequently found abnormality associated with DIC. Elevation of plasma ET-1 and big ET-1 levels was closely related to the initiation and progression of DIC and provided a higher degree of sensitivity and specificity than did other indicators in assessing patients with cancer and DIC. Vascular endothelial damage with the resultant increases in plasma ET-1 and big ET-1 levels is universally associated with DIC caused by malignancy. Excessive secretion or leakage of ET-1 and big ET-1 from injured endothelial cells may cause vasospasm and aggravate the DIC process by facilitating the formation of intravascular microthrombi, ultimately leading to ischemic end-organ dysfunction. Plasma ET-1 and big ET-1 are sensitive and specific markers for vascular endothelial injury in DIC.", "An antibody-free microfluidic paper-based analytical device for the determination of tear fluid lactoferrin by fluorescence sensitization of Tb3+.\nAn inkjet-printed microfluidic paper-based analytical device (\u03bcPAD) for the detection of lactoferrin has been developed. The analyte concentration dependent fluorescence emission, caused by the sensitization of pre-deposited terbium (Tb(3+)) upon complexation with lactoferrin on the paper device, is captured using a digital camera. The dynamic response range (0.5-3 mg mL(-1)) and the limit of detection (0.30 mg mL(-1)) of the \u03bcPAD are suitable for the analysis of normal human tears and the detection of eye disorders. Finally, lactoferrin concentrations in human tear samples were analyzed by the \u03bcPADs and the assay results corresponded within 6% error to those obtained by an immunoassay (ELISA). The \u03bcPADs provide a simple, rapid and accurate method for lactoferrin detection in tear fluid. Results are obtained within 15 min of a single application of 2.5 \u03bcL of sample. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a device for lactoferrin quantification relying neither on an immunoassay nor on high cost analytical instrumentation.", "Adult social attachment disturbance is related to childhood maltreatment and current symptoms in borderline personality disorder.\nWe characterized borderline personality disorder (BPD) along two fundamental dimensions of adult social attachment and evaluated attachment associations with childhood maltreatment and current symptoms using self-report measures in 40 outpatients with DSM-IV BPD. The BPD group had significantly greater dimensional attachment impairment and rate of fearful attachment type compared with a healthy control group. Among BPD subjects, dimensional attachment-anxiety was specifically associated with sexual abuse, whereas attachment-avoidance was associated with all five maltreatment types. The two attachment dimensions showed divergent associations with current interpersonal problems, impulsivity subtypes and mood symptoms. We conclude that (1) BPD is characterized by adult attachment disturbance; (2) these attachment problems are strongly related to childhood maltreatment, and to current interpersonal problems and clinical symptoms that are considered core features of BPD; and (3) the diverse problems of BPD patients may arise from two basic mechanisms, each tied to a different type of attachment disturbance, developmental history, and clinical outcome.", "Aged men experience disturbances in recovery following submaximal exercise.\nPhysiological responses to exercise of moderate intensity and duration among aged compared to young adults have yet to be clearly defined. Further, the effects of aging on the rate and effectiveness of postexercise recovery are unknown. Here, selected physiological responses during and following exercise of the same relative intensity were examined in untrained young and aged men. Generally, the two groups displayed similar responses during 30 minutes of exercise. During recovery, however, numerous age-related differences were manifested. Relative heart rate (% peak) was higher during recovery among the aged group. Postexercise lactate remained increased longer among aged men, and blood glucose regulation was impaired during recovery. This difference in circulating glucose was associated with insulin responses whereby young, but not aged men experienced a postexercise spike. Unlike that in young men, rectal temperature among aged men continued to increase through the entire recovery period. These data suggest that aged men encounter problems in recovering from submaximal exercise.", "Gender-based political harassment and violence: effects on the political work and public roles of women.\nThis article shows the significance of the problems of political harassment and violence against women in positions of political responsibility in Bolivia. This phenomenon is seen in both rural and urban areas and transcends borders. It has been shown that these attacks constitute a violation of women's civil and political rights and a threat to the physical and mental health of women leaders in Bolivia. Furthermore, there is no punishment of guilty parties, reparation, or moral or material compensation for the women who are affected. In Bolivia, gender-based harassment and violence is a fundamental barrier to women's political participation. However, this phenomenon is still not addressed by government programs and is not part of the public discourse and debate. In spite of the measures taken to promote women's political participation, several different administrations have been unable to guarantee women the capacity to occupy positions of responsibility without being threatened or harassed. The results of our research led to a bill addressing this problem. Subsequently, Ecuador took this bill as an example and replicated it in a legislative initiative. These results show the importance of research by organizations that represent women in preventing unjust situations and health problems.", "An excellent first glimpse from a promising new artist, this demo CD from Lethal Even Asleep features four solid EBM tracks in the late \u201890s style. Any of these tracks could be compared favorably with Leather Strip, and \u201cPure Energy\u201d in particular is reminiscent of Wumpscut\u2019s Eevil Young Flesh era. While a bit derivative at times, these songs also employ a more minimal approach to vocal production, leaving things a bit cleaner than most EBM artists instead of burying everything in faux robot effects. The sneering sarcasm of \u201cDarkness\u201d in particular is more reminiscent of Chemlab than Skinny Puppy. \u201cThe Dream\u201d is the most subdued piece, with lots of eerie minor-key pianos and a rattling percussion effect that sounds real rather than sampled, while \u201cSuppressing Gods\u201d is a straightforward but catchy aggressive track that would be perfect for the clubs. Lethal Even Asleep is a very new project and could use a little polish \u2013 the production values can be a little amateurish at times \u2013 but once this project accumulates a little more experience and puts together enough material for a full-length album, it\u2019s sure to receive some attention from labels.", "CCR7 Mediates TGF-\u03b21-Induced Human Malignant Glioma Invasion, Migration, and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition by Activating MMP2/9 Through the Nuclear Factor KappaB Signaling Pathway.\nChemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) has emerged as an inducer of invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer. In this research, human malignant glioma cells were stimulated with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) and siCCR7. The data show that CCR7 mediates TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT, migration, and invasion in U251 and U87 cells and that these effects of TGF-\u03b21 were reversed by treatment with siCCR7 or a CCR7 neutralizing antibody. Importantly, the TGF-\u03b21-mediated increase in nuclear factor kappaB (NF-\u03baB) activity in human glioma cells was reduced by treatment with siCCR7 or a CCR7 neutralizing antibody. Furthermore, CCR7 was shown to mediate TGF-\u03b21-induced glioma cancer cell migration by activating matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2)/9. Our results indicate that CCR7 mediates TGF-\u03b21-induced MMP2/9 expression through NF-\u03baB signaling, thus facilitating glioma cell migration, invasion, and EMT, all of which progressively increase with glioblastoma progression. These findings indicate that CCR7 is a potential therapeutic target for malignant glioma.", "The mental health consumer movement and peer providers in Israel.\nSelf-help peer-support groups in Israel emerged in the 1980s and, over time, dynamically interacted and co-developed with the statutory mental health (MH) system. In this editorial, I outline historical milestones of how the evolution of the Israeli mental health system was influenced by the consumer movement. A brief depiction of the consumer movement history. At first, consumers operated outside of the mainstream MH system. Gradually, consumer groups and institutional personnel joined efforts towards community integration and enhancement of quality of life, pushing forward a person-centered recovery orientation. In turn, some administrators and key stakeholders in rehabilitation community services grew to value the impact of knowledge-by-experience in contemporary mental health care. In this context, over the past decade, peer roles were developed in the mental health system, including consumer-providers in community services and peer specialists in inpatient psychiatric hospitals. The insertion of peer roles into the mainstream MH system is far-reaching, including the placement of a peer-project coordinator within the ministry of health. I describe the unique contribution of peers, as experts-by-experience, to mainstream professional knowledge and practice. I also highlight the potential challenges involved when peer models of care are added to traditional medical models of care. The Israeli case demonstrates how the consumer movement can play an active role in MH systems and be acknowledged and recognised as a partner for changing policy, practice and reshaping formal institutions. In addition, they play a vital role in the development of peer-support services.", "Social Information Processing Mechanisms and Victimization: A Literature Review.\nThe aim of the current literature review, which is based on 64 empirical studies, was to assess to what extent mechanisms of the Social Information Processing (SIP) model of Crick and Dodge (1994) are related to victimization. The reviewed studies have provided support for the relation between victimization and several social information processing mechanisms, especially the interpretation of cues and self-efficacy (as part of the response decision). The relationship between victimization and other mechanisms, such as the response generation, was only studied in a few articles. Until now research has often focused on just one step of the model, instead of attempting to measure the associations between multiple mechanisms and victimization in multivariate analyses. Such analyses would be interesting to gain more insight into the SIP model and its relationship with victimization. The few available longitudinal studies show that mechanisms both predict victimization (internal locus of control, negative self-evaluations and less assertive response selection) and are predicted by victimization (hostile attribution of intent and negative evaluations of others). Associations between victimization and SIP mechanisms vary across different types and severity of victimization (stronger in personal and severe victimization), and different populations (stronger among young victims). Practice could focus on these stronger associations and the interpretation of cues. More research is needed however, to investigate whether intervention programs that address SIP mechanisms are suitable for victimization and all relevant populations.", "Correction of pulmonary abnormalities in Sftpd-/- mice requires the collagenous domain of surfactant protein D.\nSurfactant protein D (SP-D) is a member of the collectin family of innate defense proteins. Members of this family share four distinct structural domains: an N-terminal cross-linking domain, a collagenous domain, a neck region, and a carbohydrate recognition domain. In this study, the function of the collagenous domain was evaluated by expressing a SP-D collagen deletion mutant protein (rSftpdCDM) in wild type and SP-D null mice (Sftpd(-/-)). rSftpdCDM formed disulfide-linked trimers that further oligomerized into higher order structures. The mutant protein effectively bound carbohydrate and aggregated bacteria in vitro. Whereas rSftpdCDM did not disrupt pulmonary morphology or surfactant phospholipid levels in wild type mice, the mutant protein failed to rescue the emphysema or enlarged foamy macrophages that are characteristic of Sftpd(-/-) mice. Moreover, rSftpdCDM partitioned with small aggregate surfactant in a manner similar to SP-D, but rSftpdCDM did not correct the abnormal surfactant ultrastructure or phospholipid levels observed in Sftpd(-/-) mice. In contrast, rSftpdCDM completely corrected viral clearance and the abnormal inflammatory response that occurs following pulmonary influenza A challenge in Sftpd(-/-) mice. Our findings indicate that the collagen domain of SP-D is not required for assembly of disulfide-stabilized oligomers or the innate immune response to viral pathogens. The collagen domain of SP-D is required for the regulation of pulmonary macrophage activation, airspace remodeling, and surfactant lipid homeostasis.", "Intramolecular Tetrylene Lewis Adducts: Synthesis and Reactivity.\nA series of benzyl(diphenylphosphino) and o-phenyl(diphenlyphosphino) substituted germylenes and plumbylenes were synthesized by nucleophilic substitution between the respective lithium reagent and tetrylene halide. The Lewis pairs were characterized by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. The reactivity of the tetrylenes was investigated with respect to azide addition. In the germylene case, the germaniumimide was formed as the kinetically controlled product, which rearranges upon heating to give the phosphinimide. The stannylene and plumbylene derivatives react with adamantylazide to give the azide adducts. 1-Pentene reacts diastereoselectively with the phosphagermirane to give a cyclic addition product. Trimethysilylacetylene shows an addition with the benzylphosphino-substituted germylene and plumbylene to give the cycloheteropentene molecules. The addition product between phenylacetylene and the four membered Ge-P adduct shows after addition at room temperature a 1,4-phenylmigration to give a cyclic phosphine. Alkylnitrene insertion into a Ge-C bond of the alkyne addition product of the phosphagermirane was found in reaction with adamantylazide.", "This research project is investigating some cortical correlates of attention during natural speech perception. Specifically, we are attempting to test the hypothesis that speech perception involves phasic, rather than continuous attention, and is characterized by bursts of cognitive activity at specificable linguistic boundaries in the stream of speech. The method involves the measurement of the average evoked response to irrelevant stimuli--light flashes--while the subject is attending to a tape-recorded dialogue. If the hypothesis is correct, the evoked response should be relatively inhibited when the stimulus is timed to occur during the postulated bursts of cognitive activity at linguistic boundaries. During the period covered by this report two studies of this phenomenon were carried out. Both were inconclusive because of unforeseen methodological problems. A third study is underway, incorporating the necessary design refinements. If future studies support the fundamental hypothesis this method will be used to investigate attentional deficits in schizophrenia with particular regard for the lateral specification of cortical function. This study has considerable potential leverage for the problem for hemispheric laterality and attention, since the left hemisphere seems clearly to be specialized for speech processing.", "Expression of transgenic FLIP on thyroid epithelial cells inhibits induction and promotes resolution of granulomatous experimental autoimmune thyroiditis in CBA/J mice.\nGranulomatous experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (G-EAT) is induced by transfer of thyroglobulin-primed in vitro activated splenocytes. Thyroid lesions reach maximal severity 20 d later, and inflammation resolves or progresses to fibrosis by d 60, depending on the extent of thyroid damage at d 20. Depletion of CD8+ T cells inhibits G-EAT resolution. We showed that expression of Fas-associated death domain-like IL-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (FLIP) transgene (Tg) on thyroid epithelial cells (TECs) of DBA/1 mice had no effect on G-EAT induction but promoted earlier resolution of G-EAT. However, when CBA/J wild-type donor cells were transferred to transgenic CBA/J mice expressing FLIP on TECs, they developed less severe G-EAT than FLIP Tg- littermates. Both strains expressed similar levels of the FLIP Tg, but endogenous FLIP was up-regulated to a greater extent on infiltrating T cells during G-EAT development in DBA/1 compared with CBA/J mice. After transient depletion of CD8+ T cells, FLIP Tg+ and Tg- CBA/J recipients both developed severe G-EAT at d 20. Thyroid lesions in CD8-depleted Tg+ recipients were resolving by d 60, whereas lesions in Tg- littermates did not resolve, and most were fibrotic. FLIP Tg+ recipients had increased apoptosis of CD3+ T cells compared with Tg- recipients. The results indicate that transgenic FLIP expressed on TECs in CBA/J mice promotes G-EAT resolution, but induction of G-EAT is inhibited unless CD8+ T cells are transiently depleted.", "As effects of catechins, there have been reported a suppressing effect on the increase of cholesterol and an inhibitory effect on \u03b1-amylase activity (see, for example, JP-A-60-156614 and JP-A-03-133928). For such physiological effects to manifest, it is necessary for an adult to drink tea as much as 4 to 5 cups a day. Accordingly, there has been a great demand for a technological method by which catechins can be added to beverages at a high concentration in order to facilitate the ingestion of a large amount of catechins. As one of the methods for this, catechins are added in a dissolved form to a beverage by using a green tea concentrate (see, for example, JP-A-59-219384, JP-A-4-20589 and JP-A-61-130285) or the like.\nWhere non-polymer catechins are extracted from tea leaves at high concentration for adding them at high concentration in a beverage, there is an inevitable drawback that compared with general beverages containing non-polymer catechins at low concentration, not only the bitterness and astringency derived from the non-polymer catechins but also the bitterness of caffeine, acridness of unidentified ingredients and the like synergistically increase, resulting in a beverage having the flavor and taste which are considerably different from those inherent to tea.", "Effect of multiple intravenous pamidronate courses in Paget's disease of bone.\nPamidronate is a bisphosphonate whose short-term biological efficacy in Paget's disease of bone was convincingly established many years ago. A less well studied area is the efficacy of pamidronate in slowing disease progression and in preventing and treating complications. We conducted an uncontrolled retrospective study of 79 Paget's disease patients given multiple intravenous pamidronate courses over a mean period of 45 +/- 19 months. The pamidronate dose per course was 180 mg, usually given over three days. The disease was severe and in some cases had proved refractory to other medications. Reasons for pamidronate therapy were pain or other subjective symptoms; established bone, joint, or nervous system complications; or prevention or these complications in patients with involvement of high-risk sites. Bone and joint pain improved under therapy, and in 78% of cases the outcome in terms of complication treatment and/or prevention was favorable. An important finding was waning of the clinical and biological effects of pamidronate as the number of courses increased. Fourteen percent of patients developed resistance to pamidronate, which seemed more closely related to disease extension than to focal lesion activity. These data suggest that a prompt return to normal of laboratory markers, most notably total alkaline phosphatase, should be sought, if needed by using higher doses than in our study.", "The postnatal development of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive nerves in rat atrium, studied with immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy.\nThe developmental pattern and distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactive nerves in the rat heart has been studied by indirect immunofluorescence. Anti-TH and monoclonal antibodies against the synaptic vesicle antigen SV2 were applied to whole-mount stretch preparations of the right atria from hearts of newborn to 40-day-old animals. Immunofluorescence was studied with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CFLM). Nerve fibres with TH-like immunoreactivity (TH-LI) were present throughout the atria already at birth, with the highest density around the sino-atrial (SA) node, colocalized in most nerve terminal arborizations with the synaptic vesicle marker SV2. Also, TH-positive ganglion cells were present around the openings of the caval veins. In comparison with TH-positive fibres, SV2-positive nerve terminal fibres were more delicate, and the number of fibres larger in all areas studied. In axon bundles, TH-LI was very prominent, while the SV2-LI was weak. A gradual increase in the density of innervation was observed up to the age of 40 days. The density of innervation decreased from the epicardium to the endocardium, confirmed in cross-sections of the cardiac wall. The relative density of TH-positive nerve terminals was estimated in the CFLM from the area around the SA node. At birth, about 600 white (strongly fluorescent) pixels were registered per scanned field, with the pixel number increasing gradually up to 20,000 pixels per frame in 18- and 40-day-old animals. The results show that TH-positive, possibly adrenergic, nerve fibres are present at birth, and that the pattern is qualitatively similar to that observed in adults, with the expression of synaptic vesicle antigen being present some days before the development of noradrenaline neuroeffector maturation, as shown in a number of physiological and pharmacological studies.", "Potentially modifiable resident characteristics that are associated with physical or verbal aggression among nursing home residents with dementia.\nPhysical aggression by nursing home residents is a burden to residents and staff. The identification of modifiable correlates would facilitate developing preventive strategies. The objectives of the study were to determine potentially modifiable resident characteristics that are associated with physical aggression and to correlate these characteristics with verbal aggression. This was a cross-sectional study of nursing home residents in 5 states who had at least 1 annual Minimum Data Set assessment completed during 2002. Case subjects were defined as nursing home residents 60 years and older with dementia who were reported to have been physically aggressive in the week before their assessment. Control subjects were all other residents 60 years and older with dementia. The main outcome measure was being physically aggressive during the past week. A total of 103 344 residents met study criteria, of whom 7120 (6.9%) had been physically aggressive in the week before their annual Minimum Data Set assessment. After adjustment for potential confounders, including age, sex, severity of cognitive impairment, and dependence in activities of daily living, physical aggression was associated with depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.3; 99% confidence interval [CI], 3.0-3.6), delusions (AOR, 2.0; 99% CI, 1.7-2.4), hallucinations (AOR, 1.4; 99% CI, 1.1-1.8), and constipation (AOR, 1.3; 99% CI, 1.2-1.5). Urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, fevers, reported pain, and participation in recreational activities were not significantly associated with physical aggression in multivariate analyses (P >.01 for all). Except for constipation, the correlates of verbal aggression were similar to those of physical aggression. If the associations we have estimated are causal, then treatment of depression, delusions, hallucinations, and constipation may reduce physical aggression among nursing home residents.", "Immune system changes after sexual abuse in adolescents.\nThe immunological changes in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis have been found to be similar to the immunological changes in adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The biological consequences of and immunological disruptions associated with psychological trauma in sexually abused adolescents were investigated in this study. Number of peripheral blood cells, intracellular cytokine level and cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells were measured on routine blood examination samples in adolescents aged 13-18 referred to the outpatient unit for forensic evaluation. Forty-three adolescents (patients with present/lifetime PTSD [PTSD-P/PTSD-L] associated with a history of childhood sexual abuse, n = 33; and 10 controls) were evaluated. Eosinophil percentage was high (P < 0.05), whereas stimulated intracellular interferon-\u03b3 was low (P < 0.05) in adolescents with PTSD-L compared with the control group. In PTSD-P patients exposed to repeated sexual abuse, CD3(+) HLA-DR(+) T-lymphocyte count was low (P < 0.05) compared with those with one-time sexual abuse. The increase in some immune system parameters and the decrease in several others, suggests a dysregulation of the immune system related to trauma in adolescents. Dysregulation of the immune system is known to cause autoimmune and chronic disease.", "Serum folate but not vitamin B-12 concentrations are positively associated with cognitive test scores in children aged 6-16 years.\nFolate and vitamin B-12 are important for nervous system functioning at all ages, with important roles in functions such as neurotransmitter synthesis. Although studies suggest a relation between folate and vitamin B-12 and cognitive function in the elderly population, there is relatively less evidence regarding these vitamins and children's cognitive function. The purpose of the study was to examine the associations of serum folate and vitamin B-12 with cognitive performance in children 6-16 y old in the NHANES III, conducted from 1988 to 1994, prior to the implementation of folic acid fortification. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data on 5365 children 6-16 y old from NHANES III. Serum folate and vitamin B-12 concentrations were measured, along with performance, on the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised. Associations of B vitamins with cognitive performance were assessed using linear regression models adjusted for various covariates. Higher serum concentrations of folate were associated with higher reading and block design scores after adjusting for various covariates. For example, compared with the lowest quartile of folate, children in the highest quartile scored 3.28 points or 0.19 SD units higher on the reading test (P < 0.05). Vitamin B-12 was not associated with any of the test scores. In the largest study to date, higher folate concentrations were associated with better reading and block design scores. These associations appear to be biologically plausible and merit further study.", "Impact of male age on the outcome of assisted reproductive technology cycles using donor oocytes.\nThis study assessed the influence of the age of the male partner on the outcome of oocyte donation cycles. A total of 408 couples participating in 519 consecutive anonymous oocyte donation cycles were examined. Main outcome measures were fertilization rate, embryo quality, clinical pregnancy, implantation, miscarriage and live birth rates, as well as the total reproductive potential, which estimates the outcome from fresh and cryopreserved-thawed embryo transfers. A total of 241 cycles resulted in clinical pregnancy (48.5% of transfers). The mean embryo score for transferred embryos (ESTE) was higher in cycles resulting in pregnancy (P=0.003). Semen volume (P<0.001), sperm motility (P<0.001) and fertilization rate (P=0.04) decreased significantly with advanced male age, which did not correlate with mean ESTE or implantation rate. Fertilization rate was the only predictor of ESTE (B=16.066, P=0.012), whereas inseminated/retrieved egg ratio was the only predictor of implantation rate (B=0.555, P=0.039). Pregnancy was only predicted by ESTE (Exp(B)=1.023, P<0.001), which also was the only predictor of live birth (Exp(B)=1.017, P=0.009). There was no predictor of miscarriage (47 cycles, 9.1%) identified. Although semen volume, sperm motility and fertilization rate decreased with advanced male age, embryo quality, clinical pregnancy, implantation, miscarriage and live birth rates were not affected.", "[The role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in recruiting inflammatory cells in the nose].\nCytokines and cell adhesion receptors play a pivotal role in the recruitment of cells from the peripheral blood into inflamed tissue. Allergic rhinitis has previously been described as an inflammatory reaction characterised by the migration of granulocytes into the nasal mucosa. Using this model, we investigated the release of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha TNF-alpha) and the expression of cell adhesion molecules (ELAM-1, ICAM-1 and LFA-1) in two studies involving biopsies as well as lavage and brush techniques. IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha can be found rapidly after allergen exposure and seem to initiate the cellular infiltration. The release of the chemokine IL-8 correlates with the continuously increasing number of granulocytes on the mucosal surface. Allergic rhinitis subjects showed significantly increased secretion levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-6 and of the chemokine IL-8. These findings correspond to a higher expression of the adhesion receptors ELAM-1, ICAM-1 and LFA-1 in allergic mucosa. We conclude that proinflammatory cytokines regulate the cell infiltration by the induction of adhesion receptor expression.", "Healthcare team training programs aimed at improving depression management in primary care: A systematic review.\nAlthough evidence from Latin America and the Caribbean suggests that depression can be effectively treated in primary care settings, depression management remains unevenly performed. This systematic review evaluates all the international evidence on healthcare team training programs aimed at improving the outcomes of patients with depression. Three databases were searched for articles in English or Spanish indexed up to November 20, 2014. Studies were included if they fulfilled the following conditions: clinical trials, meta-analyses, or systematic reviews; and if they evaluated a training or educational program intended to improve the management of depression by primary healthcare teams, and assessed change in depressive symptoms, diagnosis or response rates, referral rates, patients' satisfaction and/or quality of life, and the effectiveness of treatments. Nine studies were included in this systematic review. Five trials tested the effectiveness of multi-component interventions (training included), and the remaining studies evaluated the effectiveness of specific training programs for depression management. All the studies that implemented multi-component interventions were efficacious, and half of the training trials were shown to be effective. Contribution of training programs alone to the effectiveness of multi-component interventions is yet to be established. The lack of specificity regarding health providers' characteristics might be a confounding factor. The review conducted suggests that stand-alone training programs are less effective than multi-component interventions. In applying the evidence gathered from developed countries to Latin America and the Caribbean, these training programs must consider and address local conditions of mental health systems, and therefore multi-component interventions may be warranted.", "Enhanced genome annotation using structural profiles in the program 3D-PSSM.\nA method (three-dimensional position-specific scoring matrix, 3D-PSSM) to recognise remote protein sequence homologues is described. The method combines the power of multiple sequence profiles with knowledge of protein structure to provide enhanced recognition and thus functional assignment of newly sequenced genomes. The method uses structural alignments of homologous proteins of similar three-dimensional structure in the structural classification of proteins (SCOP) database to obtain a structural equivalence of residues. These equivalences are used to extend multiply aligned sequences obtained by standard sequence searches. The resulting large superfamily-based multiple alignment is converted into a PSSM. Combined with secondary structure matching and solvation potentials, 3D-PSSM can recognise structural and functional relationships beyond state-of-the-art sequence methods. In a cross-validated benchmark on 136 homologous relationships unambiguously undetectable by position-specific iterated basic local alignment search tool (PSI-Blast), 3D-PSSM can confidently assign 18 %. The method was applied to the remaining unassigned regions of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome and an additional 13 regions were assigned with 95 % confidence. 3D-PSSM is available to the community as a web server: http://www.bmm.icnet.uk/servers/3dpssm", "Ultrasound with topical anesthetic rapidly decreases pain of intravenous cannulation.\nPhysicians and nurses in the emergency department rarely use topical anesthesia when starting intravenous (IV) lines because of time constraints and lack of data on patients' perception of the pain associated with this procedure. Ultrasound pretreatment of skin increases permeation rates of hydrophobic topical medications, including topical lidocaine. The objective of this study was to demonstrate that ultrasound treatment followed by brief application of topical anesthetic decreases the patients' perception of the pain of IV cannulation. This was a randomized, controlled, prospective trial performed in a university hospital emergency department. Eighty-seven consecutive English-speaking, subcritically injured or ill adult patients able to give consent who were receiving an IV line as part of their care were enrolled. The intervention was a brief ultrasound treatment using the SonoPrep (Sontra Medical Corp., Franklin, MA) therapeutic ultrasound device (frequency, 53-56 kHz) followed by 5 minutes of 4% liposomal lidocaine cream and standard-care IV cannulation, or standard care alone. Participants rated their pain on a visual analog scale. Researchers assessed the site after IV insertion and 20-36 hours later. The primary outcome was participants' subjective pain score, and the secondary outcome was site skin irritation. The ultrasound group reported significantly less pain (p<0.001), with 80% of treated participants reporting pain scores </=3 versus only 37% of controls (p <0.001). The SonoPrep ultrasound device applied to skin for 15 seconds followed by 5 minutes of 4% liposomal lidocaine cream significantly reduced patients' perception of the pain of an IV start when compared with standard care. There were no adverse side effects noted in any participant during the 36 hours of the follow-up period.", ": Optical separate spatial dark and bright soliton pairs in steady-state case in one dimension, for a series circuit consisting of two-photon photorefractive (PR) crystal are investigated. Each crystal can be supported the spatial soliton, and at least one must be photovoltaic. The two solitons are known collectively as separate spatial soliton pairs with dark\u2013dark, bright\u2013dark and bright\u2013bright. Results show that when an optical wave has a spatial extent much less than the width of the crystal, only the dark soliton can effect on the other soliton by light-induced current, while the bright soliton doesn't have such an effect. In fact when a crystal supports a bright soliton, the light-induced current is so small that the crystal cannot act as a current source, whereas when a crystal supports a dark soliton, the light-induced current is strong enough to affect the other soliton in the other crystal. Numerical results confirm that the two solitary states remain invariant under propagation. We also show that these solitons are stable under a small perturbation.", "Direct isolation in eggs of influenza A (H1N1) and B viruses with haemagglutinins of different antigenic and amino acid composition.\nInfluenza A (H1N1) and influenza B viruses from clinical samples were isolated in the amniotic cavity of embryonated hens' eggs by classical techniques and propagated in the allantoic cavity. Virus progeny from different eggs which had been inoculated with virus material from the same clinical sample possessed antigenically distinguishable haemagglutinins (HAs). Virus progeny of some eggs possessed HAs which were serologically identical to those of virus isolated in parallel in mammalian (MDCK) cells. These egg-grown viruses possessing HAs with the antigenic phenotype of mammalian cell-grown viruses appeared to be antigenically related to epidemic influenza virus because post-infection human sera reacted to high titre with the virus HA. Specific nucleotide changes were detected in the HAs of the viruses isolated directly in eggs at positions 163 and 189 for influenza A (H1N1) viruses or positions 141 and 196 to 198 for influenza B viruses. Egg-isolated viruses which possessed the antigenic phenotype of mammalian cell-grown viruses retained glycosylation sites at positions 163 and 196. The viruses isolated directly in embryonated hens' eggs which possessed the HA antigenic phenotype and glycosylation sites of MDCK cell-grown virus can, unlike the latter viruses themselves, be used as candidate influenza vaccine viruses.", "Determinants of BMI category changes during middle childhood and adolescence in girls.\nThe aim of the study was to analyse the changes in BMI category between 7 and 16-18 years of age on the basis of continuous studies and evaluate which factors are related to the increase and decrease in BMI category. Data were collected from 1008 secondary school students aged 16-18 y. Body height and weight were measured and BMI was calculated. Information on height and body mass in earlier periods of life was retrieved from medical records. Age at menarche and socio-economic status was established on the basis of a questionnaire. Most girls who were underweight at 7 y. as well as those who were overweight or obese at 7 y. at the age of 16-18 y. reach correct body weight. The probability of the BMI category changing to higher one at 16-18 y. was related to short stature at 7, 9 and 14 y., low socio-economic status, living in the village and primary level of mother education. A drop in the BMI category was linked to the incidence of overweight and obesity at the age of 9 and 14 y. and tall stature at the age of 7 and 9 years. High socio-economic status was connected with a change in the category from \"correct weight\" at the age of 7 y. to \"underweight\" at 16-18 y., whereas the socio-economic status did not have a significant effect on the change of the category \"overweight & obesity\" at 7 y. to \"correct weight\" at 16-18 y.", "In vivo and in vitro characterization of overproduced colicin E9 immunity protein.\nWe report the overproduction of the immunity protein for the DNase colicin E9 and its characterization both in vivo and in vitro. The genes for colicin immunity proteins are normally co-expressed from Col plasmids with their corresponding colicins. In the context of the enzymatic colicins, the two proteins form a complex, thereby protecting the host bacterium from the antibiotic activity of the colicin. This complex is then released into the medium, whereupon the colicin alone translocates (through the appropriate receptor) into sensitive bacterial strains, resulting in bacterial cell death. The immunity protein for colicin E9 (Im9) has been overproduced in a bacterial host in the absence of its colicin, to enable sufficient material to be isolated for structural studies. As a prelude to such studies, the in-vivo and in-vitro properties of overproduced Im9 were analysed. Electrospray mass spectrometry verified the molecular mass of the purified protein and analytical ultracentrifugation indicated that the native protein approximates a symmetric monomer. Fluorescence-enhancement and gel-filtration experiments show that purified Im9 binds to colicin E9 in a 1:1 molar ratio and that this binding neutralizes the DNase activity of the colicin. These results lay the foundations for a full biophysical and structural characterization of the colicin E9 DNase inhibitor protein, Im9.", "Our research approach is to understand the virulence of Trichomonas vaginalis through the identification and biochemical characterization of membrane immunogens with important biological properties or functions. Four major areas of research are emphasized: i) immunochemical membrane analysis of numerous long-term grown and fresh isolates targeting key antigens as molecules governing heterogeneity; ii) assessment and identification of (membrane) antigens shed or secreted by pathogenic trichomonads; iii) parasite cytadsorption to host cells; and finally iv) continued examination of the interaction between specific host macromolecules and T. vaginalis. Numerous methodologies will be employed which include standard radiolabeling procedures, chromatographic and electrophoretic methods, centrifugation-gradient procedures, antibody reagents, sensitive and specific radio-immunoprecipitation assays, and fluorescence-Nemarski-electron microscopy. Our overall objective is to identify highly immunogenic membrane antigens of T. vaginalis which possess key biologic functions, such as ligands involved in host cytadherence or receptors of specific host proteins, both processes essential for infection of human hosts. Studies in our laboratory presented in the Preliminary Results section continue to show the progress and feasibility of our plan at understanding this host-parasite relationship and using the pathogenic human trichomonads as models.", "Neuropsychological signs of Alzheimer's disease 8 years prior to diagnosis.\nWe investigated the earliest neuropsychological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by comparing the baseline performance of 29 individuals who subsequently developed AD within an average of 7.91 \u00b1 2.70 years with 29 pairwise-matched individuals who remained cognitively healthy (NC). We hypothesized that subtle, qualitative changes in cognition precede clinical AD by several years, and therefore examined subjective as well as standard quantitative measures of cognition, in addition to subjective estimates of mood and medical status. Participants were selected from the 825 members of the longitudinal BASEL study (BAsel Study on the ELderly), all of whom had been ApoE-genotyped and received comprehensive bi-annual neuropsychological assessments. Within 13 years, 29 were diagnosed with probable AD. Each individual who progressed to AD (AD-P) was pairwise matched to a NC participant based on age, education, demographic status, observation period, and, importantly, ApoE genotype. A regression analysis using the lasso technique identified which of 115 neuropsychological variables best discriminated baseline NC from baseline AD-P performance. This analysis yielded eleven neuropsychological variables that optimally discriminated the two groups (correct classification rate: 60.4%): 1) Intrusions and 2) response bias in verbal learning and memory tasks; 3) delayed figure recall; 4-6) three Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Block Design subtest variables; 7-8) number of errors and repetitions on letter fluency; and 9-11) self-report of memory problems, a feeling of sadness, and cardiac problems. These results suggest that the preclinical neuropsychological cascade to AD includes subtle but identifiable qualitative impairments in verbal and visual memory, visuospatial processing, error control, and subjective neuropsychological complaints.", "Calcium polysulphide, its applications and emerging risk of environmental pollution-a review article.\nEasy availability, preparation technique, and economic value make calcium polysulphide (CaS x ) a very useful inorganic chemical for various field and industrial applications. In this article, disparate applications of CaS x solution have been reviewed to suggest potential and future consolidation. This article also encompasses the physiochemical properties and production of CaS x solution, with critical appraisal on research focusing on CaS x application in agriculture industries and removal of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) from the environment. The kinetics of CaS x , technical issues associated with optimization of its dosage and environmental fate is also discussed in detail. This study covers almost all of the peer-reviewed research that has been performed since 1914. Some of the critiques in this article include the lack of integration between the exposure effect and the efficiency of treatment method, effects of oxidizing environments on the long-term performance of CaS x solution, and kinetics of CaS x solution with the PTEs. The working model of CaS x with PTEs is still system dependent, and therefore cannot be used with other applications. The kinetics of CaS x is described in detail with various phase stoichiometric reactions. Environmental fate is discussed based on applications, government reports, peer-reviewed articles and kinetics of CaS x , which provides a clear picture of emerging contaminants in the environment in relation to the insect resistance and ecotoxicology. Real time, lab based research articles are needed to identify toxicity limits of CaS x in environment in order to describe its effective permissible limit in environmental system. This review article provides a risk assessment of environmental pollution by CaS x based on its physicochemical characteristic, stoichiometry, kinetics, field, and industrial applications.", "[Diagnosis of breast cancer by contact thermography (author's transl)].\nEpidemiological studies performed in cooperation with the Austrian National Institute for Statistic show an increase of breast cancer in the age-group of women older than 50 years. Especially in this age-group screening for breast cancer is very important and successful. Mammography in this age-group is the most useful and accurate method. In the group of women aged less than 50 years and particularly less than 45 years the use of mammography for screening is limited because of its risks for the induction of breast cancer in young women. Therefore the combination of clinical examination and contact-thermography is a very promising alternative for the detection of breast cancer. In 133 cases of histologically proved breast cancer the high accuracy of this combination of clinical examination and contact-thermography in comparison with mammography is shown. Based on this good results a recommendation for a detection-scheme for breast cancer with a reduction of radiation exposure in young women by the use of contact-thermography is presented and discussed.", "mRNA expression of genes regulating oxidative phosphorylation in the muscle of beef cattle divergently ranked on residual feed intake.\nOur objective was to evaluate the effects of phenotypic ranking on residual feed intake (RFI) on the transcription of genes 1) involved in the respiratory chain complex and 2) coding for transcriptional factors regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, across two contrasting diet types. Beef heifers (n = 86) fed a diet comprising 70:30 concentrate-corn silage [low forage (LF)] over a 82-day period were ranked on RFI. The 10 highest (feed inefficient, high-RFI) and 10 lowest (feed efficient, low-RFI) ranking animals were selected for the current study. Biopsies of the M. longissimus dorsi were harvested following initial selection (LF diet) and again following a 6 wk period while the animals were offered a high-forage (HF) grass silage-only diet. Real-time PCR was used to quantify mRNA transcripts of 17 genes associated with cellular energetic efficiency. The mRNA expression of UCP3 tended to be upregulated (2.2-fold, P = 0.06) for the high-RFI compared with the low-RFI animals. mRNA transcripts coding for the transcription factor PGC-1\u03b1 was 1.7-fold higher (P = 0.01) in low compared with high-RFI animals. A phenotype \u00d7 diet interaction was evident for the abundance of ANT1 mRNA transcript, with greater (P = 0.04) expression levels detected in the low-RFI phenotype during the HF period, but no difference (P = 0.50) between phenotypes during the LF period. A phenotype \u00d7 diet interaction was also evident for COX II with greater expression levels detected (P = 0.04) in the low compared with the high RFI phenotype while on LF but not the HF diet (P = 0.22). These data suggest an association between cellular energetic efficiency and RFI in cattle.", "Bonding state of metal-free CAD/CAM onlay restoration after cyclic loading with and without immediate dentin sealing.\nTo examine the bonding state of metal-free CAD/CAM onlay restorations made from two popular resin composite blocks and a typical glass-ceramic block after cyclic loading, with and without immediate dentin sealing (IDS). Standardized mesial-distal-occlusalbuccal (MODB) cavities in 24 extracted human molars were prepared. The intra-cavity dentin surfaces of half of the cavities were immediately sealed with all-in-one adhesive and flowable composite, while those of the other half were not. All cavities were scanned, from which CAD/CAM onlays were fabricated from three types of block and cemented with an adhesive resin cement system. The restored specimens were subjected to cyclic loading and the intra-cavity microtensile bond strength was measured. IDS improves not only the internal bond strength, but also the bond reliability of metal-free CAD/CAM onlay restorations. The resin composite block seems to be more effective than a typical glass-ceramic block for achieving both high bond strength and excellent bond reliability.", "Spirituality and spiritual care perspectives among baccalaureate nursing students in Saudi Arabia: A cross-sectional study.\nNo study has been undertaken to understand how spirituality and spiritual care is perceived and implemented by Saudi nursing students undergoing training for their future professional roles as nurses. This study was conducted to investigate the perception of Baccalaureate nursing students toward spirituality and spiritual care. A descriptive, cross-sectional design was employed. A convenience sample of 338 baccalaureate nursing students in two government-run universities in Saudi Arabia was included in this study. A self-administered questionnaire, consisting of a demographic and spiritual care background information sheet and the Spiritual Care-Giving Scale Arabic version (SCGS-A), was used for data collection. A multivariate multiple regression analysis and multiple linear regression analyses were performed accordingly. The mean value on the SCGS-A was 3.84\u00b11.26. Spiritual perspective received the highest mean (4.14\u00b11.45), followed by attribute for spiritual care (3.96\u00b11.48), spiritual care attitude (3.81\u00b11.47), defining spiritual care (3.71\u00b11.51) and spiritual care values (3.57\u00b11.47). Gender, academic level and learning spiritual care from classroom or clinical discussions showed a statistically significant multivariate effect on the five factors of SCGS-A. Efforts should be done to formally integrate holistic concept including all the facets of spirituality and spiritual care in the nursing curriculum. The current findings can be used to inform the development and testing of holistic nursing conceptual framework in nursing education in Saudi Arabia and other Arab Muslim countries.", "People have tried to harness wind energy for thousands of years. Lately, with fossil fuels running out, techniques for converting energy in the wind to other forms of energy and, in particular, electrical energy have become more popular. It is known to use wind turbines to extract the energy from the wind. It is also known to use kites to extract energy from the wind. Kites can fly at high altitudes where wind speeds are more reliable than the wind speed at the height of the hub of a wind turbine. The hub height of a wind turbine may be at 80 or 100 m whereas kites can be flown at a typical height of 400 to 700 m or even higher. With kite-based power generating systems, the majority of the mass is kept near to ground or water level at a base station, thereby minimising bending moments and reducing the mass of the airborne equipment considerably. Repair and service of the equipment is easier since the bulk of the equipment is at low-level. At sea, the ground based equipment can be mounted on towable barges or buoys allowing retrieval to harbour for major repair or service.\nA system for the extraction of energy from the wind using a kite typically includes a kite connected to a base station using a tether. The tethers used in kite-based power generating systems undergo considerable stress during operation due to the relatively high forces involved. It is necessary to replace exhausted tethers once they have deteriorated. The maintenance thus required has a cost in terms of time when the system is not in use as well as a financial cost. The invention was devised in this context.", "Nutritional status and nutrient intake of preschool children in northern Ghana.\nTo determine the nutritional status and nutrient intake of preschool children in a sub-Sahelian setting so as to ascertain whether they meet the acceptable standards. Prospective/investigative study. The study was carried out in Saboba, a rural sub-Sahelian village in northern Ghana. Five hundred and eighteen preschool children (2.5-6 years) drawn from three kindergartens and five other localities were used. Anthropometric measures of age, weight, and height were assessed. Blood and stool samples were taken for analyses. The nutritional status was generally poor, with 27% (140/519) stunted, 4.4% (23/519) wasted and 1.9% (10/519) wasted and stunted. Majority of the children (92%) were anaemic and 16.3% had deficient level of vitamin A (< 10 micrograms/dL). Total caloric intake was low (only 26.5% met RDA values) and apart from protein and iron whose RDA were met by the majority of the children (> 90%), the intake of other nutrients-calcium, vitamin C, vitamin A and provitamin A, were low and unacceptable, compared to their respective RDA values. In the case of iron, even though intake was adequate, the high anaemic rate of 92% was due to high incidence of malaria (32%), hookworm infestation, low intake of vitamin C and low bioavailability of iron from the mainly cereal diet. The poor nutritional status of the children was largely due to the low intake of essential nutrients.", "Child Car Safety: A Parental Survey at a Tertiary Care Emergency Treatment Center in Greece.\nThis study aimed to assess parental behavior in terms of child restraint systems (CRS) use under emergency conditions while driving to the hospital's outpatient settings as well as their routine child car safety (CCS) practices. A cross-sectional survey of parents/caregivers transporting children 13 years or younger was conducted at the Emergency Treatment Center of a pediatric tertiary care center in Athens, Greece. Participants completed a questionnaire inquiring about the possession of CRS, and type and use of appropriate CRS while driving to the Emergency Treatment Center and under routine conditions. In addition, presence and type of parental education with regard to CCS and the use of seat belts among drivers were assessed. Of 444 participants, 51.4% children were carried restrained, although 48.6% were fastened in an improper seat for their age, in contrast with 23.7% who travel unrestrained on a daily basis. Forward-facing restraint seats were most popular, with 53.9% total use even in children younger than 2 years or older than 4 years, whereas booster seats (9.4%) and rear-facing restraint seats (18.2%) were inappropriately disfavored. Children younger than 4 years, male drivers, and drivers who had received information on CCS had higher odds of using CRS. The proportion of those had never been provided any CCS education was 38.5%. Child restraint systems use was inappropriately low under routine conditions and declined even further under emergency circumstances. Most children younger than 2 years and older than 4 years traveled inappropriately restrained in a forward-facing restraint seat. Parents should be more intensively educated on child car safety seat and the proper CRS use.", "Asthma and internalizing behavior problems in adolescence: a longitudinal study.\nClinical studies of asthmatic children have found an association between lung disease and internalizing behavior problems. The causal direction of this association is, however, unclear. This article examines the nature of the relationship between behavior and asthma problems in childhood and adolescence. Data were analyzed on 5135 children from the Mater University Study of Pregnancy and its outcomes (MUSP), a large birth cohort of mothers and children started in Brisbane, Australia, in 1981. Lung disease was measured from maternal reports of asthma/bronchitis when the children were aged 5 and maternal reports of asthma symptoms when the children were aged 14. Symptoms of internalizing behaviors were obtained by maternal reports (Child Behavior Checklist) at 5 years and by maternal and children's reports at 14 years (Child Behavior Checklist and Youth Self Report). Although there was no association between prevalence of asthma and externalizing symptoms, asthma and internalizing symptoms were significantly associated in cross-sectional analyses at 5 and 14 years. In prospective analyses, after excluding children with asthma at 5 years, internalizing symptoms at age 5 were not associated with the development of asthma symptoms at age 14. After excluding children with internalizing symptoms at 5 years, those who had asthma at 5 years had greater odds of developing internalizing symptoms at age 14. Children who have asthma/bronchitis by the age of 5 are at greater risk of having internalizing behavior problems in adolescence.", "January 29, 2017. Awesome the Kitchen Table toronto Photo.

A majority of such equipment is proximate to or incorporated with a steering column assembly and is electrically activated. Typically, a 48-way column connector is utilized to connect the downlead wires associated with the steering column electronics to a steering column bulkhead. Furthermore, control circuits within a vehicle may incorporate various optional or standard equipment, such as a remote keyless entry system (RKE) that may also incorporate a burglar-proof device, a remote control starting device, a vehicle condition displaying system, a global positioning system (GPS), and a telephone remote control burglar-proof system, etc. Such equipment, however, is increasingly and typically provided as standard equipment. As a result, an increase in wiring cable and antennas is necessary for local and remote operation of the equipment, which makes it difficult to tidily manage and arrange the increased variety of sensor and control electronics within a limited amount of packaging room available to a vehicle.\nAn electrical system mounted high on a steering column subassembly for a vehicle comprising a column electronics control assembly having a plurality of interconnectable components plugged together. A method for integrating a vehicle wireless communication device is also disclosed comprising: modifying a steering column subassembly to include a circuit assembly modularly depending from a steering column subassembly and further including a communications interface for data exchange between the circuit assembly and vehicle systems, wherein the communications interface, and circuit assembly comprise a sense and control module; and positioning, adapting and configuring said sense and control module for modular communication with a plurality of interconnectable components.", "Attachment styles and sexual dysfunctions: a case-control study of female and male sexuality.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate attachment styles in a group of women and men with sexual dysfunction. We recruited 44 subjects (21 women and 23 men) with sexual dysfunction and 41 subjects (21 women and 20 men) with healthy sexual function as the control group. Validated instruments for the evaluation of male and female sexual dysfunctions (M/F SD) and a psychometric tool specifically designed to investigate attachment style were administered. In women, significant differences were found between subjects with sexual dysfunction and healthy controls. The scales indicating an insecure attachment showed: discomfort with closeness (FSD = 42.85 \u00b1 11.55 vs CTRL = 37.38 \u00b1 8.54; P < 0.01), relationship as secondary (FSD = 26.76 \u00b1 2.60 vs CTRL = 18.42 \u00b1 7.99; P < 0.01), and need for approval (FSD=26.38 \u00b1 3.61 vs CTRL = 20.76 \u00b1 7.36; P < 0.01). Healthy women also had significantly higher scores in secure attachment (confidence: FSD = 24.57 \u00b1 3.89 vs CTRL = 33.42 \u00b1 5.74; P < 0.01). Men with sexual dysfunctions differed from healthy men in confidence (MSD = 30 \u00b1 6.33 vs CTRL = 36.05 \u00b1 5.26; P < 0.01) and in discomfort with closeness (MSD = 39.08 \u00b1 8 vs CTRL = 34.25 \u00b1 7.54; P < 0.05). These results suggest that particular aspects related to insecure attachment have a determinant role in people with sexual dysfunctions. It is therefore fundamental to identify the attachment styles and relational patterns in patients receiving counselling and psychological treatments focussed on sexual problems.", "Mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase subfamily.\nThe mammalian 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is related to a growing family of protein kinases in yeast and plants that are regulated by nutritional stress. We find the most prominent expressed form of the hepatic AMPK catalytic subunit (alpha 1) is distinct from the previously cloned kinase subunit (alpha 2). The alpha 1 (548 residues) and alpha 2 (552 residues) isoforms have 90% amino acid sequence identity within the catalytic core but only 61% identity elsewhere. The tissue distribution of the AMPK activity most closely parallels the low abundance 6-kilobase alpha 1 mRNA distribution and the alpha 1 immunoreactivity rather than alpha 2, with substantial amounts in kidney, liver, lung, heart, and brain. Both alpha 1 and alpha 2 isoforms are stimulated by AMP and contain noncatalytic beta and gamma subunits. The liver alpha 1 isoform accounts for approximately 94% of the enzyme activity measured using the SAMS peptide substrate. The tissue distribution of the alpha 2 immunoreactivity parallels the alpha 2 8.5-kilobase mRNA and is most prominent in skeletal muscle, heart, and liver. Isoforms of the beta and gamma subunits present in the human genome sequence reveal that the AMPK consists of a family of isoenzymes.", "Automated Comparative Metabolite Profiling of Large LC-ESIMS Data Sets in an ACD/MS Workbook Suite Add-in, and Data Clustering on a New Open-Source Web Platform FreeClust.\nThe technological development of LC-MS instrumentation has led to significant improvements of performance and sensitivity, enabling high-throughput analysis of complex samples, such as plant extracts. Most software suites allow preprocessing of LC-MS chromatograms to obtain comprehensive information on single constituents. However, more advanced processing needs, such as the systematic and unbiased comparative metabolite profiling of large numbers of complex LC-MS chromatograms remains a challenge. Currently, users have to rely on different tools to perform such data analyses. We developed a two-step protocol comprising a comparative metabolite profiling tool integrated in ACD/MS Workbook Suite, and a web platform developed in R language designed for clustering and visualization of chromatographic data. Initially, all relevant chromatographic and spectroscopic data (retention time, molecular ions with the respective ion abundance, and sample names) are automatically extracted and assembled in an Excel spreadsheet. The file is then loaded into an online web application that includes various statistical algorithms and provides the user with tools to compare and visualize the results in intuitive 2D heatmaps. We applied this workflow to LC-ESIMS profiles obtained from 69 honey samples. Within few hours of calculation with a standard PC, honey samples were preprocessed and organized in clusters based on their metabolite profile similarities, thereby highlighting the common metabolite patterns and distributions among samples. Implementation in the ACD/Laboratories software package enables ulterior integration of other analytical data, and in silico prediction tools for modern drug discovery.", "Polyethylenimine-coated SPIONs trigger macrophage activation through TLR-4 signaling and ROS production and modulate podosome dynamics.\nPolyethylenimine (PEI) is widely used as transfection agent in preclinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo. Due to their unique chemical and physical properties, SPIONs (superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles) have been thoroughly studied as nanocarriers. PEI appears to activate different immune cells to an inflammatory response (M1/TH1), whereas the SPION-induced response seems to be context-dependent; the immunogenicity of the combination of these components has not been studied. Here we show that PEI-coated SPIONs (PMag) activate macrophages, as determined by measuring IL-12 secretion into culture medium and upregulation of several genes linked to the M1 phenotype. PMag-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, p44/p42 MAPK and JNK, and upregulation of CD40, CD80, CD86 and I-A/I-E activation markers. PMag-induced macrophage activation depended partially on TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) and ROS (reactive oxygen species) signaling. Comparison of these responses with the LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced phenotype showed differences in gene expression profiling. PMag positively modulated podosome formation in murine macrophages, but hampered gelatin degradation by these cells. In conclusion, PMag induced an M1-like phenotype that was partially dependent on both TLR4 and ROS. These results show the adjuvant potential of PMag and suggest their use in vaccination schedules.", "Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome: three additional cases with CSB mutations, new diagnostic criteria and an approach to investigation.\nThe cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome (COFS syndrome) is an autosomal recessive disorder which was initially described in a specific aboriginal population from Manitoba. In recent years, COFS syndrome has been linked in this original population to a defective DNA repair pathway and to a homozygous mutation in the major gene underlying Cockayne syndrome (CSB). However, most reports of suspected COFS syndrome outside this population have not been confirmed at the molecular level, leading to considerable heterogeneity within the syndrome and confusing overlaps between COFS syndrome and other eye and brain disorders. To refine the delineation of the syndrome on genetically proven COFS cases. We report the exhaustive clinical, cellular and molecular data of three unrelated COFS patients with mutations in the CSB gene. All three patients present the cardinal features of COFS syndrome including extreme microcephaly, congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism and arthrogryposis. They also exhibit a predominantly postnatal growth failure, a severe psychomotor retardation, with axial hypotonia and peripheral hypertonia and neonatal feeding difficulties. Fibroblasts from the patients show the same DNA repair defect which can be complemented by transfection of the CSB wild-type cDNA. Five new mutations in the CSB gene have been identified in these patients. Our data indicate that COFS syndrome represents the most severe end of the Cockayne spectrum. New diagnostic criteria for COFS syndrome are proposed, based on our findings and on the few genetically proven COFS cases from the literature.", "The association between autism spectrum disorder and psychotic experiences in the Avon longitudinal study of parents and children (ALSPAC) birth cohort.\nStudies report overlap between autism spectrum disorders and psychosis. This may indicate a relationship between the 2 disorders or an artificial overlap due to similarity of symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate whether autism spectrum disorder and autistic traits predict psychotic experiences in early adolescence. This study analyzes prospective data from a cohort. A dataset was analyzed of 5,359 cohort members who had provided data on autistic traits and/or a diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder and psychotic experiences at age 12 years. A diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder (odds ratio = 2.81, 95% confidence interval = 1.07, 7.34 p = .035) and childhood autistic traits (odds ratio = 1.15, 95% confidence interval = 1.05, 1.26 p = .0018) were associated with psychotic experiences after adjustment for confounders. These findings suggest a shared neurodevelopmental origin for autism and psychosis.", "A sensitive immunoassay for the detection of bacterial contamination of platelets is proposed for development under this Phase I grant. No commercial assay of this type is currently available. However, transfusion-associated sepsis resulting from the use of contaminated platelets is estimated to cause over 20 fatalities per year in the United States, the majority due to gram-negative bacteria. The frequency of non- fatal cases of clinical sepsis is 10-100 times greater. Recent studies have shown that about 1 in 3,000 platelet units is contaminated with bacteria. Because of the potential for such contamination, the FDA has established a five day expiration date for platelet units stored at room temperature. As a result, about 15% of platelet units are discarded every week. The proposed immunoassay will rely on the capture and detection of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), with emphasis on the selection of reagents with broad specificity for gram-negative bacterial species. The assay will combine the affinity of anti-LPS antibodies or LPS-binding peptides with immunofiltration and electrochemical detection, approaches which have been demonstrated to significantly enhance the sensitivity of detection of bacteria. The aim is to develop a cost-effective, technically robust assay capable of automation within the blood bank or hospital environment. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Approximately 5-8 million platelet units are generated each year in the United States, none of which are currently screened for bacterial contamination due to lack of an available commercial assay. The proposed assay will be the first to address this urgent need. The technically simple, relatively inexpensive assay to be developed will ultimately be made available in automated format to every blood bank and hospital in the United States, a significant market estimated to be over $100 million per year.", "MRI metrics as surrogate markers for clinical relapse rate in relapsing-remitting MS patients.\nTo formally validate metrics derived from conventional MRI as surrogate endpoints for relapse rate in MS. Although metrics derived from MRI are used widely in clinical trials of MS, a formal statistical validation of MRI metrics as surrogate endpoints for clinical outcome in MS is lacking. A validation procedure was applied to clinical and MRI data collected in the context of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of glatiramer acetate in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. The four Prentice operational criteria were applied to assess surrogacy for the number of new enhancing lesions, the percentage change of T2 lesion volume, and a composite MRI score based on these two metrics. The results of this analysis show that all three MRI measures considered by the authors had a behavior compatible with the Prentice criteria for valid surrogates. The composite MRI score correlated with relapses and accounted for much of the treatment effect on relapse rate. This preliminary study suggests that conventional MRI metrics might serve as valid surrogate endpoints in MS trials with glatiramer acetate or treatments thought to have a similar mode of action.", "Production of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-like particles from cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying the gag gene of HIV.\nWe constructed a recombinant vaccinia virus carrying the entire gag and pol genes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The main gene product detected in the lysates of infected CV-1 and SW480 cells was the gag precursor protein. However, in the culture fluid of infected SW480 cells, but not of infected CV-1 cells, reverse transcriptase (RT) activity was detected. The highest RT activity was found at a density of 1.15 g/ml and this fraction contained many round particles with diameters of 100-150 nm. In contrast to the infected cell lysates, the particles contained the processed gag and pol proteins, suggesting that particle formation may be a prerequisite for efficient processing of the gag precursor by the HIV protease encoded in the pol gene. Particles were also recovered from the culture fluid of SW480 cells infected with another recombinant vaccinia virus carrying only the gag gene. These particles contained the unprocessed gag precursor, indicating that the gag precursor alone was sufficient for particle production.", "Endogenous parathyroid hormone-related peptide enhances proliferation and inhibits differentiation in the osteoblast-like cell line ROS 17/2.8.\nTo investigate potential effects of endogenous parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) on osteoblast function, ROS 17/2.8 cells were transfected with full-length PTHrP cDNA in a sense or antisense orientation to alter PTHrP production. Compared with vector-transfected control cells, PTHrP-overproducing (sense-transfected) cells showed increased DNA synthesis ([(3)H]-thymidine incorporation) and increased growth (cell number). The extent of apoptosis was compared for the different clones using the terminal deoxynucleotide-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling assay (TUNEL) and Hoechst staining. No differences in percentages of apoptotic cells were found under basal culture conditions or after 3 days of serum deprivation, which, itself, markedly increased numbers of apoptotic cells. The effect of PTHrP on osteoblast differentiation was assessed by examining two protein markers of differentiation, alkaline phosphatase, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2. Alkaline phosphatase activity was decreased in sense-transfected cells and increased in antisense-transfected cells, compared with cells transfected with empty vector. PTHrP-overproducing cells also showed decreased numbers of BMP-2-positive cells, whereas antisense-transfected cells showed no difference compared with vector control. The results indicate that: (a) endogenously produced PTHrP can increase growth of these osteoblastic cells by stimulating proliferation while not affecting apoptosis; and (b) the increased cell proliferation produced by PTHrP was accompanied by a reduction in activity or amount of two proteins normally expressed by differentiated osteoblasts.", "In vitro chemosensitivity testing in acute non lymphocytic leukemia using the bioluminescence ATP assay.\nThe ATP assay is a short term in vitro chemosensitivity assay where the amount of viable cells are determined by their content of ATP. The aim of the study was to compare the in vitro results of six cytostatic drugs to the clinical outcome in 83 acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) patients. The secondary ANLL at diagnosis showed an in vitro resistance to daunorubicin that was significantly higher compared to de novo ANLL at diagnosis (P<0.003). De novo ANLL at diagnosis that achieved complete remission (CR) were significantly more sensitive to daunorubicin compared to those who didn't achieve CR (P<0.05). There was an vitro correlation between topoisomerase II active drugs but not between these drugs and ara-C. In vitro ara-C sensitivity (< or = the median of the de novo ANLL at diagnosis) was correlated to poor overall survival (P = 0.02). In vitro sensitivity to daunorubicin and mitoxantrone was associated with prolonged disease free survival (P = 0.03 and P = 0.04). We conclude that despite significant correlation to clinical parameters for daunorubicin and mitoxantrone the predictive value of the ATP assay in this material was insufficient for directing therapy.", "Ovarian cancer tumor infiltrating T-regulatory (T(reg)) cells are associated with a metastatic phenotype.\nThe objective of this study was to examine the clinicopathologic correlates of T-regulatory (T(reg)) cell infiltration in serous ovarian cancers and to define gene signatures associated with high T(reg)s. Tumor infiltrating T(reg) and cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) were quantitated in 232 primary serous ovarian cancers by immunostaining for FOXP3 and CD8. Expression microarray analysis was performed in a subset of 48 advanced cancers with the highest and lowest numbers of infiltrating T(reg)s and a genomic signature was developed using binary regression. ANOVA analysis was performed to assess the most differentially expressed genes and these genes were further assessed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. High T(reg) infiltration in ovarian cancers was associated with high grade (p<0.0001), advanced stage (p=0.004) and suboptimal debulking (p<0.04), but not with survival. In contrast, high tumor infiltrating CD8 CTL infiltration was associated with favorable survival (median survival 48.7 vs. 34.6 months, p=0.01). A microarray-based genomic signature for high tumor-infiltrating T(reg) cells had a 77% predictive accuracy using leave-one-out cross-validation. ANOVA of microarray data revealed the antigen presentation pathway as the most differentially expressed canonical pathway (p<0.00001) between cancers with high and low T(reg) cells. These data suggest that there may be an association between increased T(reg) cell infiltration in ovarian cancers and advanced stage. Increased T(reg) infiltration is characterized by a genomic signature enriched with several immunologic pathway genes. Therapeutic strategies that reduce tumor infiltrating T(reg) cells are under investigation and may prove useful in ovarian cancers with high numbers of these cells.", "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common chronic arrhythmia and affects an estimated 2.2 million people in the United States. This arrhythmia is associated with a significant degree of morbidity, accounting for approximately 75,000 strokes each year and is independently associated with a 1.5 to 1.9 fold risk of death. Despite the impact of AF, it is ironically one of the least well understood arrhythmias. The causative genes of lone AF are being studied extensively, but lone AF accounts for only 5% of all AF. The much more common acquired form of AF is likely due to a complex interaction between multiple environmental and genetic factors. To further identify these factors, one can begin by studying the contribution of family to the risk of acquired AF. Family case-control studies have been used extensively to more accurately quantify the familial aggregation of complex diseases. We hypothesize that presence of AF in first degree relatives is a risk factor for developing AF. In this study, we propose a family case-control study to help further quantify this risk. After correcting for established risk factors of AF, part of this risk will be accounted for by yet unidentified environmental risk factors associated within families. However, this will also provide a measure of the potential contribution of genetic risk and will highlight the need for further genomic studies of acquired AF.

Fourteen dental students were assigned a random ordering of the chewing gum products and received professional tooth cleaning at the start of trial periods. For each trial period, subjects were instructed to use 5 pieces of the unlabeled chewing gum daily (containing 5.0 mg CHX acetate/piece; 0.8 xylitol/piece; or 1.0 g sorbitol/piece). Two pieces of chewing gum were used following each morning and evening meal and one piece following the noon meal. The subjects were instructed to use the products for 20 minutes at each occasion. A 7-day washout-period between trial periods was used. The Turesky modification of the Quigley and Hein index was used to assess plaque formation. Differences between treatments were evaluated using a repeated measures ANOVA with Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons. The CHX-containing chewing gum showed significantly reduced plaque values (0.7 +/- 0.4) compared to the sorbitol-(2.7 +/- 0.4; P < 0.01) and xylitol-product (1.7 +/- 0.3; P < 0.01). Furthermore, the CHX-product significantly reduced plaque levels compared to the study subjects' regular plaque control routines (1.3 +/- 0.04; P < 0.05). The xylitol-product exhibited significantly lower plaque-values than the sorbitol-product (P < 0.01). Our results suggest that regular use of CHX-containing chewing gum appears useful to control dental plaque formation.", "Biosurfactant/s from Lactobacilli species: Properties, challenges and potential biomedical applications.\nLactic acid bacteria are generally believed to have positive roles in maintaining good health and immune system in humans. A number of Lactobacilli spp. are known to produce important metabolites, among which biosurfactants in particular have shown antimicrobial activity against several pathogens in the intestinal tract and female urogenital tract partly through interfering with biofilm formation and adhesion to the epithelial cells surfaces. Around 46 reports are documented on biosurfactant production from Lactobacillus spp. of which six can be broadly classified as cell free biosurfactant and 40 as cell associated biosurfactants and only approximately 50% of those have reported on the structural composition which, in order of occurrence were mainly proteinaceous, glycolipidic, glycoproteins, or glycolipopeptides in nature. Due to the proteinaceous nature, most biosurfactant produced by strains of Lactobacillus are generally believed to be surlactin type with high potential toward impeding pathogens adherence. Researchers have recently focused on the anti-adhesive and antibiofilm properties of Lactobacilli-derived biosurfactants. This review briefly discusses the significance of Lactobacilli-derived biosurfactants and their potential applications in various fields. In addition, we highlight the exceptional prospects and challenges in fermentation economics of Lactobacillus spp.-derived biosurfactants' production processes.", "Medical management of thoracic aortic aneurysm disease.\nThe patient with thoracic aortic aneurysm disease requires careful evaluation and management over his or her lifetime. This includes assessment for the presence of an underlying genetic disorder, such as Marfan syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve disease, or a familial aortic aneurysm syndrome. Screening family members is necessary, inasmuch as up to 20% of first-degree relatives of the patient with a thoracic aortic aneurysm will also have aneurysm disease. Medical therapy is often prescribed, and beta-blocker therapy to reduce the stress on the aortic wall is usually recommended. However, very few clinical trials of pharmacologic therapy in humans with thoracic aortic aneurysm disease have been conducted. Mouse models have led to important discoveries and insight into the pathogenesis of aneurysm syndromes, and there is hope these may lead to effective therapy in people. Several studies are ongoing that examine the role of angiotensin receptor blockers in Marfan syndrome. Lifestyle modification is also important for patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm, including restrictions on physical activity, weight lifting, and recommendations about the management of pregnancy. Long-term surveillance of the aorta, even after successful surgery, is necessary for timing of prophylactic surgery and to evaluate for late complications.", "Metabolic flux analysis of CHO cell metabolism in the late non-growth phase.\nChinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell cultures are commonly used for production of recombinant human therapeutic proteins. Often the goal of such a process is to separate the growth phase of the cells, from the non-growth phase where ideally the cells are diverting resources to produce the protein of interest. Characterizing the way that the cells use nutrients in terms of metabolic fluxes as a function of culture conditions can provide a deeper understanding of the cell biology offering guidance for process improvements. To evaluate the fluxes, metabolic flux analysis of the CHO cell culture in the non-growth phase was performed by a combination of steady-state isotopomer balancing and stoichiometric modeling. Analysis of the glycolytic pathway and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) indicated that almost all of the consumed glucose is diverted towards PPP with a high NADPH production; with even recycle from PPP to G6P in some cases. Almost all of the pyruvate produced from glycolysis entered the TCA cycle with little or no lactate production. Comparison of the non-growth phase against previously reported fluxes from growth phase cultures indicated marked differences in the fluxes, in terms of the split between glycolysis and PPP, and also around the pyruvate node. Possible reasons for the high NADPH production are also discussed. Evaluation of the fluxes indicated that the medium strength, carbon dioxide level, and temperature with dissolved oxygen have statistically significant impacts on different nodes of the flux network.", "Diet modification and its influence on metabolic and related pathological alterations in the SHR/NDmcr-cp rat, an animal model of the metabolic syndrome.\nSHR/NDmcr-cp (SHR/NDcp) rats, which carry a nonsense mutation of the leptin receptor gene, are known to spontaneously develop hypertension, obesity and hyperlipidemia, and have therefore found use as an animal model of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. However, some recent studies on SHR/NDcp rats revealed only mild elevation of blood glucose levels. To investigate whether metabolic factors including blood glucose and histopathological alterations of SHR/NDcp rats deteriorate with a diabetogenic diet, biochemical and histopathological examinations were conducted with animals fed normal or diabetogenic diets for 20 weeks. SHR/NDcp rats receiving the normal diet displayed obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and mild elevation of blood glucose and HbA1c levels. Urinary glucose excretion was noted in only 1 out of 6 animals. Histologically, macro- and micro-vesicular steatosis in the liver, glomerular and tubular damages in the kidney and islet hyperplasia mainly of beta cells in the pancreas were characteristically noted. In SHR/NDcp rats fed the diabetogenic diet, obesity was more severe, with higher blood glucose and HbA1c levels, increased numbers of animals with urinary glucose excretion, and more pronounced hepatic steatosis and renal tubular changes. However, elevation of blood glucose levels and urinary glucose excretion proved transient. These observations indicate that the diabetic state and associated histopathological alterations in SHR/NDcp rats are exacerbated by feeding a diabetogenic diet, but the effects are limited. Elevated islet function with compensative insulin secretion might be related to amelioration of the hyperglycemic state. Further diet modification could be needed to induce a more prominent and persistent diabetic state in SHR/NDcp rats.", "[Possible prognostic value of arterial hypertension in postmenopausal women with breast cancer in complete clinical remission. Pilot study].\nThe objective of this work was to determine the blood pressure of postmenopausal women with breast cancer in complete clinical remission of long duration. It in a pilot study of case and controls, in which we measure the Blood Pressure (BP) of 83 postmenopausal women, with breast cancer histologically confirmed, in complete clinical remission of long duration, recruited by consecutive sampling, to compare it with that of 70 normal postmenopausal women of the same age used as controls. They ara calculated the body mass index (BMI), the corporal surface, the confidence intervals (CI) of the means, the correlation between the BMI and the BP in both groups (breast cancer patients and normal control) and between the free disease interval and the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The mean of the systolic BP in 93 breast cancer patients in complete clinical remission was 163 mm Hg (95% CI 155-171) and in 70 normal controls was 134 mm Hg (95% CI 129-139). The difference between both groups in statistically significant (p < 0.001). The mean of the diastolic BP in the breast cancer patient in complete remission it was 98 mm Hg (94-104) and in the normal controls was 78 mm Hg (74-82). The difference between both groups was statistically significant (p < 0.001). This arterial hypertension, independent of the BMI and from the duration of the free disease interval, is associated with a long duration of the complete remission in postmenopausal breast cancer patients and consequently with a good prognostic of this disease.", "[Iatrogen femoral nerve lesions].\nWith the increasing number of orthopaedic and gynaecologic operations also the number of iatrogenic nerve lesions has increased. The femoral nerve is especially at risk because of its anatomic course. In this study we take a look at the most frequent causes of iatrogenic femoral nerve lesions, their therapy and prevention. From January 2000 to June 2008 13 patients (10 f, 3 m) with iatrogenic femoral nerve injuries underwent surgery. 7 (53.9 %) of the lesions were caused by the implantation of a hip prothesis, 2 (15.4 %) by the resection of a tumour and one each by an abdominal hysterectomy, spinal surgery, femoral block and by wearing a corsette because of scoliosis for more than one year. In femoral nerve lesions neurolysis was performed in 12 cases (92.3 %) and nerve transplantation in 1 case (7.7 %). Surgery results were excellent (M4, S4) to fair (M3, S2). The most important factor for a good result was the time period between injury and surgery. Femoral nerve lesions have a good prognosis if they are diagnosed in time and treated surgically when there are no signs of spontaneous recovery.", "Increased serum soluble leptin receptor levels in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.\nWe investigated whether or not serum levels of the soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R) and leptin are related to anthropometric and metabolic changes during pubertal development of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Blood levels of sOB-R, leptin and HbA1C, as well as body-mass index (BMI), diabetes duration and daily insulin doses, were determined in 212 (97 girls; 115 boys) children with type 1 diabetes mellitus and compared with the sOB-R serum levels in 526 healthy children and adolescents. OB-R serum levels and parallel values of the molar ratio between sOB-R and leptin were significantly higher in children with diabetes than in normal children (P<0.05) in almost all investigated Tanner stages. Furthermore, in the entire group of patients, we demonstrated statistically significant correlations (P<0.02) between sOB-R and the duration of diabetes (r=0.30), HbA1c levels (r=0.32) and the insulin dose (r=0.18). Multiple-regression analysis revealed that HbA1c (12.4%), height (7.9%) and duration of diabetes (8.7%) contributed to 29% variance of sOB-R in diabetic children. Our data suggest that poor glycemic control in diabetes may lead to increased serum levels of sOB-R. This regulation of sOB-R appears to be independent of leptin, but may have an impact on leptin action. The consequently developing molar excess of sOB-R related to leptin could reduce leptin sensitivity and may, therefore, influence leptin-related anthropometric and metabolic abnormalities.", "Outpatient pharmacotherapy and modes of administration for acute repetitive and prolonged seizures.\nAcute repetitive seizures (ARS) are a serious epilepsy phenomenon, generally described as closely grouped seizures over minutes to 2 days, representing an increase in seizure frequency compared with baseline. In some instances, ARS may not stop without treatment, and evolution into status epilepticus is a significant concern. Additionally, neuronal injury may occur after even brief repeated seizures. Given the substantial risks that may be involved with ARS, it is crucial to develop appropriate protocols for identification and management of this seizure phenomenon. This article focuses on pharmacotherapy and, in particular, different modes of administering medication for ARS in the outpatient setting. Our aim was to present a review of data from non-randomized and randomized, controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of out-of-hospital ARS treatments. Several of the studies included patients with ARS, as well as patients with prolonged seizures. Prolonged seizures, or seizures lasting greater than 5 min, have similar risks and treatment options to those of ARS; therefore, this discussion also includes treatment trials and recommendations for prolonged seizures. All trials used benzodiazepines, a class of drugs that are ideal for the ARS and prolonged seizure populations because of their rapid onset of action and minimal adverse effects. Rectal diazepam is currently the only formulation approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for out-of-hospital treatment. Oral benzodiazepines are appropriate only for mild ARS. Intramuscular diazepam autoinjection has shown success against ARS in clinical trials. Intranasal midazolam and diazepam are in testing. Other treatments have also been explored--specifically, buccal midazolam (approved in the European Union), sublingual lorazepam and intranasal lorazepam.", "Improvement of objective GERD parameters after radiofrequency energy delivery: a European study.\nThe Stretta procedure is an endoluminal radiofrequency energy delivery system for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The purpose of this study was to present, for the first time, the Stretta treatment experience from European centers. Sixty patients with a history of GERD from six European centers underwent Stretta treatment from May 2001 to June 2003. All patients were at least partly responsive to daily proton-pump inhibitors. Esophageal motility, endoscopy, and ambulatory 24-h pH studies were done in all patients at baseline and 6 and 12 months after treatment. We evaluated medication use, satisfaction, GERD-health-related quality of life, 24-h pH-metry, manometry, and endoscopy. Sixty patients (31 M, 29 F, mean age 47+/-13 years, mean years of GERD 7.4+/-7.2) were treated with the Stretta procedure. At 12 months after treatment, 75% of the patients needed no medication or less medication than before treatment. They were more satisfied with their symptom control and had statistically significantly fewer GERD symptoms (mean lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure improved from 14.8+/-9.1 to 16.7+/-10.0 mmHg, p=0.002 and mean total reflux time from 16.7+/-12.8 to 8.8+/-6.6%, p=0.001). Quality of life (mean score decreased from 19.2+/-9.0 to 6.6+/-7.3, p<0.0001) and overall physical and mental health also improved significantly. The experience with the Stretta procedure performed at centers in Europe confirms that it is well tolerated and effective in the treatment of GERD. It has a favorable impact on medication requirements, LES pressure, esophageal acid exposure, and GERD symptom scores. The Stretta procedure should be considered for patients who are not satisfied with drug therapy, and who are considering anti-reflux surgery.", "Can virtual reality trainers improve the compliance discrimination abilities of trainee surgeons?\nThe assessment of tissue compliance using a handheld tool is an important skill in medical areas such as laparoscopic and dental surgery. The increasing prevalence of virtual reality devices raises the question of whether we can exploit these systems to accelerate the training of compliance discrimination in trainee surgeons. We used a haptic feedback device and stylus to assess the abilities of na\u00efve participants to detect compliance differences with and without knowledge of results (KR) (groups 1 and 2), as well as the abilities of participants who had undergone repetitive training over several days (group 3). Kinematic analyses were carried out to objectively measure the probing action. Untrained participants had poor detection thresholds (mean just noticeable difference, JND = 33%), and we found no effect of KR (provided after each trial) on performance (mean JND = 35%). Intensive training dramatically improved group performance (mean JND = 12%). Probing action (in particular, slower movement execution) was associated with better detection thresholds, but training did not lead to systematic changes in probing behaviour. These findings set a benchmark for training systems that act to increase perceptual sensitivity and guide the learner toward optimal movement strategies to improve discrimination.", "Contribution of ATP to oxidative stress-induced changes in action potential of isolated cardiac myocytes.\nThe role of ATP in oxidative stress-mediated changes in the cardiac action potential was investigated in isolated adult rat cardiac myocytes. Superfusion with H2O2 led to a decrease in the energy charge and depletion of nonprotein thiols and elicited hypercontracture of the myocytes. Treatment with 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), an inhibitor of protein ribosylation, increased the lifetime of H2O2-exposed myocytes and attenuated depletion of ATP and nonprotein thiols. H2O2-mediated DNA strand breaks were increased in the presence of 3-AB. On exposure to H2O2, myocytes patch clamped with 1 mM ATP in the pipette initially displayed prolonged action potential durations (APD), which were later markedly abbreviated and accompanied by the activation of ATP-sensitive K+ currents (I(K,ATP)). The late decrease in APD was inhibited by glibenclamide (which inhibits I(K,ATP)), but the initial prolongation of the action potential was exacerbated. Treatment with 3-AB or recordings with 10 mM ATP in the patch pipette caused an initial delay in the expression of H2O2-induced changes, but later caused a more pronounced and sustained increase in APD. These interventions delayed the activation of I(K,ATP). Thus enhanced ribosylation (presumably due to activation of DNA repair) appears to be a significant source of ATP depletion under oxidative stress that, via activation of I(K,ATP), mediates oxidative modifications in the action potential.", "MENU Home About Us \u2013 Who We Are Sections \u2013 Read a random article! \u2013 The Editorial We \u2013 \u2013 Dude-Duder-Dudeist \u2013 \u2013 Great Dudes in History \u2013 \u2013 Sermons From the Sofa \u2013 \u2013 The Tao of the Dude \u2013 Dudespatches \u2013 \u2013 Lebowskia \u2013 \u2013 Events \u2013 \u2013 What-Have-You \u2013 Dude Testaments \u2013 Dudeist Leisure \u2013 \u2013 Fabulous Stuff, Man \u2013 Arts \u2013 \u2013 Books \u2013 \u2013 Dudels \u2013 \u2013 Duder Verse \u2013 \u2013 Miscellaneous \u2013 \u2013 Movies \u2013 \u2013 Music \u2013 Dude University \u2013 Columns \u2013 \u2013 A World of Pain \u2013 \u2013 Dear Dudely \u2013 \u2013 Dude Simple \u2013 \u2013 Dude Zealand \u2013 \u2013 Dudeman Nature \u2013 \u2013 Guest Columns \u2013 \u2013 Keeping the Baksheesh \u2013 \u2013 No Frame of Reference \u2013 \u2013 Notes on the Cycle \u2013 \u2013 Pin Dudeism \u2013 \u2013 Strongly Vaginal \u2013 \u2013 Surprised at my Tears \u2013 \u2013 The Dad Abides \u2013 \u2013 The Swedish Jeff \u2013 \u2013 What Exactly is the Problem \u2013 \u2013 You Might Be a Dudeist If\u2026 \u2013 \u2013 Uncategorized Dude University Dudeism Store Contribute Greatest Hits Contact Us", "A promising oral fucoidan-based antithrombotic nanosystem: Development, activity and safety.\nFucoidan-loaded nanoparticles emerge as great candidates to oral anticoagulant therapy, due to increasing of bioavailability and circulation time of this natural anticoagulant. Crosslink between chitosan chains are performed using glutaraldehyde to confer higher gastric pH resistance to nanoparticle matrices. In this work, chitosan-fucoidan nanoparticles, without (NpCF) and with glutaraldehyde crosslink (NpCF 1% and NpCF 2%), were prepared to evaluate their anticoagulant, antithrombotic and hemorrhagic profile. Nanoparticles were characterized by average diameter, polydispersity index, zeta potential, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and fucoidan in vitro release. Anticoagulant and antithrombotic activities were determined by in vitro and in vivo models, respectively. Hemorrhagic profile was in vivo evaluated by tail bleeding assay. Preparations showed nanometric and homogeneous average diameters. Zeta potentials of NpCF and NpCF 1% were stable over gastrointestinal pH range, which was confirmed by low fucoidan release in gastric and enteric media. In pH 7.4, NpCF and NpCF 1% demonstrated fucoidan release of 65.5% and 60.6%, respectively, within the first 24 hours. In comparison to fucoidan, NpCF and NpCF 1% showed increased in vitro anticoagulant activity. A significant difference on oral antithrombotic profile of NpCF 1% was found in comparison to fucoidan. Bleeding profile of NpCF and NpCF 1% showed no differences to control group, indicating the safety of these systems. Surprisingly, oral antithrombotic profile of commercially available fucoidan, from Fucus vesiculosus, has not been previously determined, which reveals new possibilities. In this work, significant advances were observed in anticoagulant and antithrombotic profiles of fucoidan through the preparation of NpCF 1%.", "Benefit of \u03b2-blocker treatment for patients with acute myocardial infarction and preserved systolic function after percutaneous coronary intervention.\n\u03b2-blockers are the standard treatment for myocardial infarction (MI) based on evidence from the pre-thrombolytic era. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of \u03b2-blocker treatment in patients with acute MI and preserved systolic function in the era of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We analysed a multicentre registry and identified 3019 patients who presented with acute MI between 2004 and 2009. Patients were treated with PCI, had left ventricular EFs \u226550% according to echocardiograms that were performed during the index PCI, and were alive at the time of discharge. The association between \u03b2-blocker use after discharge and mortality (all-cause death and cardiac death) within 3 years was examined. Patients who were not treated with \u03b2-blockers (n=595) showed higher rates of all-cause death and cardiac death compared to patients treated with \u03b2-blockers (10.8% vs 5.7%, p<0.001, 7.6% vs 2.6%, p<0001). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed that \u03b2-blocker treatment was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause death (adjusted HR 0.633, 95% CI 0.464 to 0.863; p=0.004) and cardiac death (adjusted HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.70; p<0.001). Comparable results were obtained after propensity score matching. \u03b2-blocker treatment was associated with reduced long term mortality in patients with acute MI and preserved systolic function who received PCI.", "Treatment and outcome of thrombosed aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery: institutional experience and a systematic review.\nThrombosed aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) usually show large dimension and complex morphology with neck sclerosis and perforating vessels originating from the sac. Only limited experiences from case reports or small mixed series including thrombosed aneurysms in different locations are available in literature. To systematically review all the pertinent literature, a comprehensive literature review with the search terms \"MCA, aneurysm, and thrombosis\" and a pooled analysis including our institutional series were performed. We evaluated demographics, ruptured status, aneurysm morphology, topography and size, thrombosis extension, treatment, complications, final occlusion rate, and clinical outcome at follow-up. Data were individually extracted for each patient and included in a pool for the statistical analysis. Forty-two articles published between 1992 and 2016 were selected, including a total of 115 patients. Most of thrombosed aneurysms were saccular (67.6%), large or giant (86.7%), and located at the MCA bifurcation (67.3%). The treatment of choice was surgery in more than 80% of cases compared with the endovascular techniques, though the overall percentage of complications reported in the two groups was similar and around 20% of cases. Clinical outcome was favorable in more than 85% of patients after treatment. This is the first systematic review focusing on treatment and outcome of thrombosed MCA aneurysms. Our data depict their main angioarchictectural and clinical characteristics, proving the feasibility of their treatment with good prognosis in a high percentage of patients. However, complication and mortality rates of about 20 and 3.5%, respectively, are not negligible.", "A case of Meniere's disease with vertical nystagmus after administration of glycerol.\nA 62-year-old woman who complained of repetitive vertigo with a left fluctuating hearing loss was admitted to our hospital three times. A glycerol test was done on the third admission. Two hours after the administration of glycerol, the patient complained of rotatory vertigo with a downbeat vertical nystagmus. This nystagmus then changed its direction upward. Her left hearing loss was improved during the glycerol test. On the day after the glycerol test, a caloric test was done. The caloric response of the right ear was remarkably improved. Although she had not felt a hearing loss in the right ear, an overwritten audiogram showed a fluctuation of hearing in the right ear. The bilateral caloric responses fluctuated. From these findings, it appears that the function of the inner ear on both sides fluctuating. We speculate that the administration of glycerol elicited an asymmetry in the function of the inner ear on both sides and ocuured vertigo with vertical nystagmus because of the irritation of both ears.", "Determination of the hydroxyapatite-nucleating region of bone sialoprotein.\nBone sialoprotein (BSP) was shown to be a potent nucleator of hydroxyapatite (HA) in a steady-state agarose gel system (Hunter and Goldberg, 1993, PNAS 90: 8562). Nucleation of HA was also demonstrated with the homopolymer poly-glutamic acid but not with poly-aspartic acid or osteopontin. Since BSP contains contiguous sequences of glutamic acid, it is reasonable to suggest that the HA-nucleating activity of BSP resides within these regions. Purified porcine BSP was treated with trypsin and digests fractionated by gel filtration. In addition to small peptides (P3-5), two peptides of 38 kDa (P1) and 25 kDA (P2) were recovered, and after characterization assigned to the regions within BSP encompassing residues 133-272 (P1) and 42-125 (P2). Each of these peptides contained one of the two glutamic acid-rich regions of porcine BSP. In the steady-state agarose gel system, BSP, P1 and P2 induced HA formation, whereas the pooled small BSP-derived peptides (P3-5) did not. Analysis by circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that the homopolymer poly-L-glutamic acid assumes a helical structure, while poly-L-aspartic acid does not. These findings suggest that the nucleating activity does not require intact molecules, that the nucleation of HA and BSP appears to require glutamic acid-rich sequences in a helical conformation and that there are two domains in porcine BSP that are each capable of nucleating HA.", "The validity of heart failure diagnoses obtained from administrative registers.\nPopulation-based administrative registers could be used for identifying heart failure (HF) cases. However, the validity of the classification obtained from administrative registers is not known. The validity of HF diagnoses obtained by record linkage of administrative databases in Finland was assessed against classification by three independent physicians. Data from the nationwide registers in Finland - the Hospital Discharge Register, Causes of Death Register, Drug Reimbursement Register, and pharmacy prescription data - were linked with the FINRISK 1997 survey data. Cases with hospitalizations before the survey date with HF as one of the discharge diagnoses, cases with special reimbursement for HF drugs before the survey date and cases with the use of furosemide before the survey date were classified as HF in the registers. All these cases, cases with baseline brain natriuretic peptide > 100 pg/ml, and cases with use of digoxin were independently assessed by two physicians as HF/no HF. Discrepant cases were solved by a third physician. This classification was considered as the gold standard, against which the registers were assessed. The specificity of the registers was 99.7% (95% CI 99.5-99.8%), positive predictive value 85.9% (95% CI 79.7-90.5%), negative predictive value 97.9% (95% CI 97.6-98.2%), and sensitivity 48.5% (95% CI 42.9-54.2%). Classification obtained from administrative registers has high specificity and can be used in follow-up studies with HF as an end point. Sensitivity is modest and administrative data should be used with caution for surveillance.", "[Role and mechanism of Th17/Treg in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome].\nObjective: To explore the role and the mechanism of Th17/Treg in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). Methods: A total of 100 patients who completed polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep lab of Affiliated Wujiang Hospital of Nantong University from Mar. 2015 to Apr. 2016 were enrolled and divided into four groups (primary snoring as the control group, mild OSAHS, moderate OSAHS and severe OSAHS) according apnea hypopnea index (AHI). The proportion of Th17, Treg (of CD4+ T cells) and the expression of interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-6 were detected and the relevant data were analyzed by the correlation analysis and the multiple stepwise regression analysis. Results: Compared with the control group, the OSAHS patients had higher Th17% [(1.36\u00b10.46)%, (1.68\u00b10.30)%, (2.23\u00b10.03)% vs (1.02\u00b10.22)%], Th17/Treg [(0.22\u00b10.07), (0.28\u00b10.10), (0.29\u00b10.00) vs (0.13\u00b10.03)], IL-17A [(2.53\u00b10.89), (2.99\u00b11.96), (7.77\u00b11.63) vs (1.45\u00b10.78) ng/L], IL-6 [(6.14\u00b14.37), (9.41\u00b14.66), (12.58\u00b16.65) vs (5.44\u00b13.13) ng/L] and lower Treg% [(7.57\u00b10.16)%, (6.46\u00b11.57)%, (6.10\u00b11.19)% vs (8.02\u00b11.45)%] (all P<0.05). A positive correlation could be seen between Th17%, Th17/Treg, IL-17A, IL-6 and AHI, oxygen desaturation index (ODI) respectively, there was a negative correlation between Th17%, Th17/Treg, IL-17A, IL-6 and the lowest oxygen saturation (SpO2) (all P<0.05). The proportion of Treg had a negative correlation with AHI or ODI and a positive correlation with the lowest SpO2 (all P<0.05). The lowest SpO2 was the most important factor which could influence Th17%, Treg% and the radio of Th17/Treg. Conclusions: There is an imbalance of Th17/Treg in OSAHS. Therefore, Th17 and the relevant inflammatory cytokines may be involved in the occurrence and development of OSAHS.", "Interactions between the renin-angiotensin system and prostanoids in modulating renal function in potassium-depleted healthy women.\nPlasma renin activity (PRA) and urinary aldosterone excretion were determined in healthy women with normal potassium balance (N, n = 20) or experimental potassium depletion (KD). KD was induced by natriuretic treatment--associated with replacement of net NaCl and water losses--and low dietary potassium intake (< or = 10 mmol/d). By using different depletion patterns, three groups were obtained with cumulative potassium deficits (mean +/- SEM) of 160 +/- 43 (KD1, n = 8), 198 +/- 22 (KD2, n = 6) and 215 +/- 54 mmol (KD3, n = 6). The renal function by the clearance (cl.) method and urinary concentrations of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (6KPGF), and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) by the RIA method were estimated during hypotonic polyuria (oral water load) and subsequent moderate antidiuresis induced by low-dose infusion of lysine-8-vasopressin (LVP). 1. In all KD groups the depletion treatment significantly reduced both potassium plasma concentration (PK) and urinary potassium excretion while it increased basal PRA; the basal urinary aldosterone excretion was not significantly different from normokalemic controls. In the KD3 vs KD1 group the P kappa value was significantly lower. 2. In both KD2 and KD3 groups as compared to the N group, several hypokalemic-like renal dysfunctions--absent in the KD1 group--occurred. Particularly, in the KD2 + KD3 vs N group the renal ability in both urine diluting (water load) and concentrating (LVP infusion) was significantly impaired.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a fundamental biological process to protect cells from DNA damage. Defects in the genes involved in regulating apoptosis are frequently found in tumors. In mammalian cells, apoptosis induced by DNA damage is regulated through mitochondria by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. However, the mechanism by which DNA damage initiates apoptosis remains to be fully characterized. Our recent studies identified a novel Bcl-2 family protein called PUMA, which appears to play an important role in cell death. Induction of PUMA triggered a rapid and profound apoptotic response in human cancer cells. PUMA functions through other Bcl-2 family proteins including Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. PUMA is a direct target of p53, which plays a central role in DNA damage response. PUMA can also be induced by chemotherapeutic drugs, such as the DNA damaging agent adriamycin, in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, deletion of PUMA in colon cancer cells by homologous recombination led to a markedly decreased apoptotic response to p53 and adriamycin. Based on these observations, we propose to test the hypothesis that PUMA mediates initiation of DNA damage-induced apoptosis in human cancer cells: Aim l. To define the mechanism of PUMA-mediated apoptosis initiation in human cancer cells; Aim 2. To determine if PUMA is activated through the p53-regulated DNA damage response pathway; Aim 3. To investigate if the apoptotic response to DNA damage is abrogated in PUMA-deficient cells.", "One of the difficulties with treatment of water in the skimmer basket region of a pool or spa is that the water treatment device becomes clogged with debris. One prior art approach is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,124,032 where the canister that holds chlorine is maintained above or along side the skimmer basket. Another approach is shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,779,913 and 6,019,893, which show a dispenser that is secured to the underside of a skimmer basket. While not holding water purification materials, U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,350 discloses a pool skimmer basket that includes a central member that projects above the top of the skimmer basket in order to prevent the basket from becoming clogged and thus preventing flow there through. Thus, the placement of water purification devices in a skimmer basket is generally avoided because of clogging problems.\nThe present invention provides a water treatment system wherein a water treatment device can be effectively positioned in a number of different locations in the flow of water with debris, with the water treatment device maintaining the water inlet to the water treatment device in a condition, wherein water can continue to be directed through the water treatment system even though there is a continual presence of debris in the water flowing around the water purification device.", "Disentangling Conscience Protections.\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced its intent to strengthen enforcement of legal protections for health care providers' conscience rights. It proposed regulations that would give the DHHS Office of Civil Rights greater authority to ensure that recipients of federal funding comply with federal conscience laws. This recent development creates an opportunity for scholars and policy-makers to revisit the perennial debate about whether and how law should protect health care providers' rights of conscience. Arguments about who should be protected, what actions should be protected, and whether there should be any limitations on the exercise of conscience rights have brought us no closer to a resolution. However, there is one remaining avenue for analysis that has, surprisingly, received very little attention-the question of how providers are protected, and from what consequences. Existing U.S. conscience laws immunize health care providers from a wide range of adverse consequences-including civil liability, criminal prosecution, administrative penalties, adverse action by employers, and discrimination by private actors, among others. However, academic and public policy debates rarely acknowledge the breadth of these protections. It is essential to disentangle this network of possible protections.", "Growth factor stimulation of cryopreserved CD34+ bone marrow cells intended for transplant: an in vitro study to determine optimal timing of exposure to early acting cytokines.\nStimulating CD34+ hematopoietic cells with growth factors prior to transplantation may decrease the duration of post-transplant aplasia. The optimal time in which to deliver this stimulus remains unclear. We therefore sought to determine if progenitor cell cloning efficiency, as reflected by colony forming units-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) colony formation, differed when growth factor stimulation was carried out prior to freezing or after thawing. To address this issue, CD34+ marrow cells were suspended in Iscove's medium with 20% bovine calf serum. They were then stimulated with kit ligand (KL), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) for 36 h either prior to cryopreservation or immediately after thawing. We observed that cells stimulated prior to freezing formed more CFU-GM colonies than cells stimulated after thawing. We also found that CD34+ cells stimulated with growth factors either before or after freezing gave rise to more CFU-GM colonies than thawed cells plated without prestimulation. Thus, the cloning efficiency of stored marrow, as reflected by CFU-GM colony formation, may be effectively enhanced by pretreating cells with hematopoietic growth factors. Our data further suggest that the optimal time for this treatment is before cryopreservation as opposed to immediately after thawing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "7-But-2-ynyl-9-(6-methoxy-pyridin-3-yl)-6-piperazin-1-yl-7,9-dihydro-purin-8-one is a novel competitive and selective inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase IV with an antihyperglycemic activity.\n7-But-2-ynyl-9-(6-methoxy-pyridin-3-yl)-6-piperazin-1-yl-7,9-dihydro-purin-8-one (ER-319711) is a novel dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV inhibitor discovered in our laboratories. In this study, we have characterized this DPP-IV inhibitor in vitro and in vivo as an antidiabetic agent. The trifluoroacetate salt form of ER-319711, ER-319711-15, inhibited human DPP-IV with an IC(50) value of 0.089 microM, whereas its IC(50) values toward human DPP8 and DPP9 were >100 microM. Inhibition kinetic pattern analysis indicated that ER-319711-15 inhibited DPP-IV in a competitive manner. ER-319711-15 (1 mg/kg) reduced glucose excursion in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using Zucker fa/fa rats, with significant increases in plasma insulin and active glucagon-like peptide-1 levels. In an OGTT using mice fed a high-fat diet in which ER-319711-15 (0.1-10 mg/kg) was orally administered at 0 h, and glucose was loaded at 0 and 5 h, this compound improved glucose tolerance dose dependently at both 0- and 5-h glucose loading. Next, we compared efficacy of ER-319711-15, E3024, a competitive DPP-IV inhibitor having an imidazopyridazinone structure, or vildagliptin, a slow-binding and long-acting DPP-IV inhibitor, at the same dose, 10 mg/kg, in the same procedures. At the first glucose challenge, all compounds lowered area under the curve (AUC) values of delta blood glucose between 0 and 2 h significantly to the same degree. At the second glucose load, the AUC values between 5 and 7 h were significantly decreased by ER-319711-15 and vildagliptin, but not by E3024. Therefore, ER-319711 might be a potent, competitive, and selective DPP-IV inhibitor with an antihyperglycemic activity.", "Dental microwear and microstructure in early oligocene primates from the Fayum, Egypt: implications for diet.\nTextbook descriptions usually portray the Fayum anthropoideans as frugivores, with Parapithecus grangeri including a folivorous component in its diet and Apidium a component of hard-object feeding. Recent work with modern mammals has shown that analyses of both dental microwear and dental microstructure may yield insights into diet and tooth use. The purpose of this study was to combine these two techniques to gain a better perspective on the paleobiology of the Fayum higher primates. Dental microwear analyses involved the use of high resolution epoxy casts of Aegyptopithecus, Parapithecus, and Apidium housed in the Duke University Primate Center. Scanning electron micrographs were taken at x500, and all microwear features in each micrograph were digitized. For microstructure analyses, molar teeth were sectioned in a variety of planes, lightly etched, and photographed in the SEM. Results of the dental microwear analyses indicate that the three Fayum anthropoideans all clustered with modern primate frugivores but that there were also significant differences between Aegyptopithecus and the other two Fayum genera. By contrast, dental microstructure analyses showed important differences between Apidium and the other two genera. The reason for these differences probably lies in a combination of body size and dietary differences, with Aegyptopithecus occasionally feeding on hard objects and Apidium maximizing wear resistance through a unique emphasis of radial (rather than decussating) enamel.", "Over six weeks ago, at about 3:53 PM on Wednesday, March 8, 2017, officers were dispatched to Boston Medical Center for a walk-in shooting victim. On arrival, officers were informed that the victim was in surgery. While on scene at the hospital, officers received information indicating that the incident may have occurred in the area of 200 Quincy Street in Disrtict C-11 (Dorchester). In light of this information, officers were dispatched to that location. Once there, officers were able to observe and collect evidence and information confirming that a shooting incident had occurred at the location. Specifically, officers discovered and recovered blood and ballistic evidence at the scene. Moreover, officers were able to ascertain and learn the identity of the suspect wanted in connection to the shooting. As such, BPD investigators secured an arrest warrant for Jonathan Whigham, 29, of Boston charging him with the shooting. In the days and weeks after the incident, the BPD Fugitive Apprehension Team developed and obtained information indicating the suspect was hiding out in Chicopee, MA. Armed with this information, members of the Fugitive Apprehension Unit, with help from US Marshals and Chicopee Police, located and arrested the suspect today, Friday, April 21, 2017, in the area of 597 Chicopee Street in Chicopee, MA. The suspect, Jonathan Whigham, to be charged with Assault by Means of a Dangerous Weapon (Gun), Unlawful Possession of a Firearm and the Unlawful Possession of Ammunition.", "Silodosin versus naftopidil in Japanese patients with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia: a randomized multicenter study.\nSilodosin is a novel drug that is highly selective to subtype alpha 1A and, since 2006, has been used in Japan for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia. This study aimed to compare the clinical effects of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, silodosin, with those of naftopidil in patients presenting lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. This was a randomized, open-label, controlled multicenter study carried out in Japan. Overall, 121 participants with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia were randomized to receive silodosin (4 mg twice daily) or naftopidil (50 mg once daily) for 4 or 8 weeks. Patients were divided into four groups: the alpha-blocker-naive groups received silodosin (35 patients) or naftopidil (33 patients) and the drug-switching groups changed from tamsulosin to silodosin (26 patients) or naftopidil (27 patients). The outcomes parameters were the International Prostate Symptom Score, quality of life, maximum urinary flow rate and post-void residual urine volume. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank and rank-sum tests, and analysis of covariance. In all the groups, silodosin and naftopidil significantly improved the total International Prostate Symptom Score and quality of life. However, silodosin obtained significantly better improvement in total International Prostate Symptom Score in the alpha-blocker-naive patients at 4 and 8 weeks. The maximum urinary flow rate and residual urine did not change significantly in all the treatment groups. The present study confirms the clinical usefulness of silodosin in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.", "Removal of orthopedic implants in children: morbidity and postoperative radiologic changes.\nOne hundred twenty-one procedures for the removal of metalwork performed on 110 children aged 1-15 years is reported, with a focus on postoperative morbidity and radiographic skeletal changes. The removals were for a variety of acute and chronic pediatric orthopedic conditions. The level of postoperative morbidity was lower than in adult study groups with only one refracture (0.9%). Only four removals were considered to be difficult. All patients had a postoperative radiograph taken. The skeletal response to the fixation device was assessed by measuring the degree of cortical assimilation of the implant. Dynamic compression plating was compared with third tubular fixation. Overall cortical indentation was 7.3% in the third tubular group and 41.6% in the dynamic compression plating group; similar results were found in forearm fracture and hip osteotomy subgroups (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon unpaired test). The degree of indentation was related to the length of time for which the plate was left in situ. It is postulated that plates with high stress-rising characteristics are incorporated with growth and should both be removed early and have strictly limited indications for their use.", "Neurofilament proteins are synthesized in nerve endings from squid brain.\nIt is generally believed that the proteins of the nerve endings are synthesized on perikaryal polysomes and are eventually delivered to the presynaptic domain by axoplasmic flow. At variance with this view, we have reported previously that a synaptosomal fraction from squid brain actively synthesizes proteins whose electrophoretic profile differs substantially from that of the proteins made in nerve cell bodies, axons, or glial cells, i.e., by the possible contaminants of the synaptosomal fraction. Using western analyses and immunoabsorption methods, we report now that (a) the translation products of the squid synaptosomal fraction include neurofilament (NF) proteins and (b) the electrophoretic pattern of the synaptosomal newly synthesized NF proteins is drastically different from that of the NF proteins synthesized by nerve cell bodies. The latter results exclude the possibility that NF proteins synthesized by the synaptosomal fraction originate in fragments of nerve cell bodies possibly contaminating the synaptosomal fraction. They rather indicate that in squid brain, nerve terminals synthesize NF proteins.", "Effect of denaturants on the structure and activity of 3-hydroxybenzoate-6-hydroxylase.\nThe effect of denaturants such as urea, sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS), guanidinium hydrochloride (Gu.HCl) on the structure of enzyme 3-hydroxybenzoate-6-hydroxylase was studied using intrinsic fluorescence and far and near-UV-CD spectroscopic techniques. Also, activity profiles of the enzyme, as a function of increasing concentrations of denaturants were studied. The far-UV CD spectrum of the enzyme did not show appreciable alterations in the presence of urea, SDS or Gu.HCl, thereby suggesting that the protein does not undergo gross conformational changes in its alpha-helical secondary structure. The treatment of enzyme with 2 M urea resulted in almost complete loss of catalytic activity, accompanied by the reduction of emission fluorescence of enzyme. Similarly, treatment with 0.01% SDS also caused almost complete loss of activity and quenching of enzyme fluorescence as well as a red shift in the emission peak. In addition, reduction in the intensity of near-UV-CD spectrum, especially at 280 nm was observed. About 70% of the activity was lost by treatment with 20 mM Gu.HCl, accompanied by quenching of intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme. The change in intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme in the presence of 5 mM-100 mM Gu.HCI could be correlated to progressive loss of catalytic activity. Thus, intrinsic fluorescence (due to tryptophan residues) could be used as an effective probe to provide an insight into the relation between the activity and subtle conformational changes of the enzyme. The results suggested that denaturants caused very slight conformational changes in the enzyme that perturbed the microenvironment of aromatic amino acid residues such as tryptophan accompanied by reduction or loss of catalytic activity.", "Progress of colorectal cancer screening in United States: Past achievements and future challenges.\nThe United States has seen progress with colorectal cancer with both falling incidence and mortality rates. Factoring into this decline, the significance of early detection and removal of precancerous lesions through screening must be underscored. With the advancement of screening modalities, attention has been directed towards optimizing the quality of screening and detecting adenomas. Colorectal cancer screening has been a major agenda item for national gastroenterology societies, culminating in a major victory with passage of the Balanced Budget Act that allowed for Medicare coverage of colorectal cancer screening. Colonoscopy as the primary screening modality was solidified in the 1990s after landmark studies demonstrated its superiority over modalities for detecting precancerous polyps. Despite progress, colorectal cancer screening disparities between race and gender continue to exist. Legislative efforts are on-going and include the SCREEN Act and Dent Act that aim to further improve access to screening. The National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable has launched colorectal cancer screening initiatives targeting at risk populations. Today, the current goal of these initiatives is to reach colorectal screening rate of 80% of eligible patients by 2018. With these initiatives, efforts to narrow the gaps in screening disparities and lower overall mortality have been prioritized and continued by the medical community. This review article details colorectal cancer screening progress to date and highlights major studies and initiatives that have solidified its success in the United States.", "Association analysis of common variants of STAT6, GATA3, and STAT4 to asthma and high serum IgE phenotypes.\nImmune responses characterized by T H 2 type cells and IgE are important for the development of asthma and atopy. The transcription factors STAT6, GATA3, and STAT4 mediate the cytokine-induced development of naive CD4 + T cells into either T H 1 or T H 2 type. We studied genetic variation of the STAT6, GATA3, and STAT4 genes and examined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these loci were associated with asthma or serum high IgE levels in the Finnish asthmatic families. With denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography we screened all exons and exon-intron boundaries of the genes in 14 to 22 patients. All identified SNPs were genotyped in 120 nuclear families, and the haplotypes were analyzed by Haplotype Pattern Mining based statistical analysis. When potential association was observed, the analysis was replicated among 245 asthmatic patients and 405 population-based control subjects. A total of 23 SNPs were identified, of which 8 were not previously listed in the SNP database. Interestingly, a haplotype analysis of GATA3 showed 3 related haplotypes that associated with different asthma and atopy related phenotypes among both the family and case-control data sets. For STAT6 and STAT4, no significant association to asthma or serum total IgE levels was observed. We identified a panel of novel SNPs in genes coding for proteins important in the T H 1/T H 2 cell differentiation. SNPs of the GATA3 gene showed an initial association to asthma-related phenotypes. Elucidation of the importance of the identified panel of SNPs in other T H 1/T H 2 mediated diseases will be of great interest.", "A role of CPEB1 in the modulation of proliferation and neuronal maturation of rat primary neural progenitor cells.\nCytoplasmic polyadenylation binding protein 1 (CPEB1) is a RNA binding protein, which regulates translation of target mRNAs by regulating polyadenylation status. CPEB1 plays important roles in the regulation of germline cell development by modulating cell cycle progression through the polyadenylation of target mRNAs such as cyclin B1. Similar mechanism is reported in proliferating astrocytes by us, although CPEB1 is involved in the transport of target mRNAs as well as local translation at dendritic spines. In this study, we found the expression of CPEB1 in cultured rat primary neural progenitor cells (NPCs). EGF stimulation of cultured NPCs induced rapid phosphorylation of CPEB1, a hallmark of CPEB1-dependent translational control along with cyclin B1 polyadenylation and translation. EGF-induced activation of ERK1/2 and Aurora A kinase was responsible for CPEB1 phosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition studies suggested that ERK1/2 is involved in the activation of Aurora A kinase and regulation of CPEB1 phosphorylation in cultured NPCs. Long-term incubation in EGF resulted in the down-regulation of CPEB1 expression, which further increased expression of cyclin B1 and cell cycle progression. When we down-regulated the expression of CPEB1 in NPCs by siRNA transfection, the proliferation of NPCs was increased. Increased NPCs proliferation by down-regulation of CPEB1 resulted in eventual up-regulation of neuronal differentiation with increase in both pre- and post-synaptic proteins. The results from the present study may suggest the importance of translational control in the regulation of neuronal development, an emerging concept in many neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder.", "The 1p deletion is not a reliable marker for the prognosis of patients with neuroblastoma.\nHuman neuroblastoma cells often have deletions of the distal short arm of chromosome 1 (1p). Earlier studies using chromosome analysis had suggested that the 1p deletion is correlated with a poor survival chance for the patient. We have reevaluated this possibility by analyzing 51 neuroblastomas for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 1p. We detected LOH in 32% of the cases. LOH did not correlate with the age of the patients at diagnosis or with tumor stage but was correlated significantly with amplification of the MYCN proto-oncogene. Nine of 10 MYCN-amplified tumors had deletions in 1p (P < 0.001). Survival chances of patients with tumors carrying MYCN amplification together with the deletion at 1p were decreased significantly (eight of nine affected patients died) compared with a patient group without any of these aberrations (P < 0.001). However, the deletion of 1p alone without MYCN amplification was not associated with a poor outcome compared with patients who had neither deletion nor amplification (only two of eight affected patients died; P = 0.803). From these data we conclude that 1p deletions are not reliable markers to determine a patient's prognosis. They may, however, identify a subgroup of neuroblastomas in which MYCN is amplified readily, resulting in rapid tumor progression.", "Premature menopause: exploring the experience through online communication.\nThe authors explored the experience of premature menopause by analyzing 1350 posted messages by 98 women, with unique usernames, to an online discussion board over a 90 day period between December 2005 and March 2006. Four particularly problematic aspects emerged that related to the following themes: legitimizing the symptoms, the impact of diagnosis (\"losing me\"), treatment (\"regaining me\"), and feeling alone. It appeared that premature menopause, regardless of the cause, was a largely negative experience, compounded by the often lengthy process of confirming a diagnosis based on ambiguous and often vague symptoms, the scarcity of suitable information about the condition, and the subjective lack of perceived support that the women received. Furthermore, a feeling of being different, through the lack of menstruation and fertility choices, often led to relationship problems and generally a loss of well-being. Women with premature menopause would benefit from the development of tailored information and support that addresses these problematic aspects of the condition.", "The collagenolytic action of MMP-1 is regulated by the interaction between the catalytic domain and the hinge region.\nThe role of the hinge region in the unwinding and cleavage of type I collagen by interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) has been studied at 37 \u00b0C and pH 7.3. The collagenolytic processing by MMP-1 displays a very similar overall rate for both chains of collagen I, even though the affinity is higher for the \u03b1-1 chain and the cleavage rate is faster for the \u03b1-2 chain. MMP-1 binding to collagen I brings about a significant unwinding of the triple-helical arrangement only after the first cleavage step of the \u03b1-1 and \u03b1-2 chains. The proteolytic processing by wild-type MMP-1 on a synthetic substrate and collagen I has been compared with that observed for site-directed mutants obtained either by truncating the hinge region (\u2206255-272) or by individually replacing the conserved amino acids Val268, Gly272, and Lys277 of the hinge region with residues observed for the corresponding position in stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), a noncollagenolytic metalloproteinase. The \u2206256-272 mutant has no collagenolytic activity, clearly demonstrating the crucial role of this region for the enzymatic processing of collagen I. However, among various mutants investigated, only Gly272Asp shows a dramatically reduced enzymatic activity both on the synthetic substrate and on collagen I. This effect, however, is clearly related to the substituting residue, since substitution of Ala or Asn for Gly272 does not have any effect on the kinetic properties of MMP-1. These data suggest that the substrate specificity of MMP-1 is dictated by the reciprocal structural relationships between the catalytic domain and the carboxy-terminal domain through the conformational arrangement of the hinge region.", "We have investigated the interaction of lipoproteins with liposomes to form recombinant particles. A number of lipoprotein fractions (VLDL, IDL, LDL, and HDL) all disrupt liposome structure by an essentially irreversible and quasistoichiometric process. In the case of HDL, the major apoprotein, A-I, recombines with dimyristoyl phosphatidyl choline vesicles at 40:1 lipid:protein to form discs approximately 100 angstroms in diameter and 32 angstroms in thickness, with protein on the rim. These structural results were obtained by a combination of neutron scattering, electron microscopy, and column chromatography. With dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, A-I also forms that we term \"vesicular recombinant\" particles in a process which may relate to physiological mechanisms by which proteins are assembled into membranes and lipoproteins. To study this process we have developed a technique called \"phase transition release\" (PTR) which is also being applied to study incorporation of tubulin into membranes. Lipoproteins were labelled with the fluorescent lipid 3,3-dioctadecylindo-carbocyanine for studies of interaction with cell surface lipoprotein receptors. The lipoproteins are also being labelled with NBD lipids for two-color fluorescene identification of cells in atheroscleroic plaques.", "A Less-Invasive Retroperitoneal Lumbar Approach: Animal Feasibility Study and Primary Clinical Study.\nSurgical approach development in an animal model, and a prospective study comparing clinical outcomes between novel and conventional approaches in thoracolumbar burst fracture fixation. To investigate the feasibility of a less-invasive retroperitoneal approach to the lumbar spine in a sheep model and to compare the clinical outcomes of anterior reconstruction in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures using novel and conventional approaches. The anterior retroperitoneal lumbar approach is well established for anterior lumbar surgical procedures in both humans and animal models. However, potential concerns include the increased risk of complications such as soft-tissue trauma, and extended periods of rehabilitation postoperatively. A less-invasive retroperitoneal approach was designed in a sheep model with minimal soft-tissue dissection to keep the abdominal and paravertebral muscles intact. Eight sheep underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion using this approach. In the clinical study, 48 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures underwent anterior decompression and reconstruction. The less-invasive approach and conventional approach were applied in 12 and 36 cases, respectively. The clinical outcomes during the minimum 12-month follow-up of the 2 groups were compared. With the less-invasive approach, anterior lumbar interbody fusion was accomplished in all sheep, and no surgical complications were observed. In the clinical study, operation time, blood loss, and duration of hospitalization were comparable between 2 groups. Using the less-invasive approach decreased the length of incision, 3-day postoperative visual analogue scale score, postoperative independent standing, and narcotic-dependent duration. No surgical complications were observed in either group. Our results and early experience suggests that the less-invasive retroperitoneal approach is safe and effective for anterior lumbar surgery. Compared with the conventional approach, significantly better postoperative rehabilitation and abdominal muscle preservation were seen with this novel approach.", "Bacterial synthesis of recombinant alpha-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide.\nThe high-level synthesis of alpha-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide hormone in Escherichia coli has been achieved based on the idea that the yield of a small, basic and unstable polypeptide, such as the natriuretic polypeptide, would be improved by fusion with an appropriate protective polypeptide to construct a neutral fused polypeptide. We prepared an expression vector, pCLaHtrp3t, coding a neutral polypeptide containing 130 amino acid residues in which the polypeptide hormone was fused to a newly designed protective polypeptide through lysine as an enzymatically cleavable residue. The fused polypeptide was synthesized at the high level of 32% of total cellular proteins and at 4.7 X 10(6) molecules per single cell. It was recovered as cellular insoluble fraction and purified to homogeneity. For the isolation of the peptide hormone from the resultant fused polypeptide, Achromobacter protease I, a lysine-specific endopeptidase was used, because it has sufficient activity even in 8 M urea. The recombinant natriuretic polypeptide was indistinguishable from native alpha-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide as regards amino acid sequence as well as biological activity.", "Expression of C-ETS1 in early chick embryo mesoderm: relationship to the hemangioblastic lineage.\nIn situ hybridization was used to detect the expression of the c-ets1 protooncogene during formation of the germ layers in the chick blastodisc. c-ets1 transcripts were present during the gastrulation process, i.e. when the mesodermal cells invaginated. The expression became down-regulated in lateral plate and the dorsal part of the somites while an intense signal was retained in the intermediate cell mass. When vasculogenesis started, c-ets1 transcripts labelled blood islands and endothelial cells. Before the mesoderm split, transcripts were present over the whole layer, more abundant however on its ventral side in contact with the endoderm. After the mesoderm split, silver grains became distributed asymmetrically: splanchnopleural mesoderm expressed c-ets1 messengers all over while expression in the somatopleural mesoderm was restricted to a few profiles corresponding to small endothelial cell groups. This asymmetrical distribution of c-ets1 transcripts is in agreement with our previous experimental findings establishing the different potentialities of the two mesodermal layers regarding hemopoiesis, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis processes.", "Synergistic effect of calcium and zinc on glucose/xylose utilization and butanol tolerance of Clostridium acetobutylicum.\nBiobutanol outperforms bioethanol as an advanced biofuel, but is not economically competitive in terms of its titer, yield and productivity associated with feedstocks and energy cost. In this work, the synergistic effect of calcium and zinc was investigated in the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation by Clostridium acetobutylicum using glucose, xylose and glucose/xylose mixtures as carbon source(s). Significant improvements associated with enhanced glucose/xylose utilization, cell growth, acids re-assimilation and butanol biosynthesis were achieved. Especially, the maximum butanol and ABE production of 16.1 and 25.9 g L(-1) were achieved from 69.3 g L(-1) glucose with butanol/ABE productivities of 0.40 and 0.65 g L(-1) h(-1) compared to those of 11.7 and 19.4 g/L with 0.18 and 0.30 g L(-1) h(-1) obtained in the control respectively without any supplement. More importantly, zinc was significantly involved in the butanol tolerance based on the improved xylose utilization under various butanol-shock conditions (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 g L(-1) butanol). Under the same conditions, calcium and zinc co-supplementation led to the best xylose utilization and butanol production. These results suggested that calcium and zinc could play synergistic roles improving ABE fermentation by C. acetobutylicum.", "[Soft contactlenses in general practice (author's transl)].\nIn contrast to the hard lenses the soft lens has enough permeability for oxygen and water-soluble substances, whereas high molecular substances, bacteria and virus cannot penetrate the soft lenses, so long as their surfaces are intact. The two principal production methods, the spin cast method and the lathe-turned method are compared. The duration of wearing of the soft lens depends on the deposits of proteins from the tears on the surface of the lens and the desinfection method. The daily boiling of the lenses shortens their useful life, while chemical desinfection causes besides bacteriolysis, damage of the corneal cell protein. The new cleaners on the base of proteolytic plant enzymes promise good results. For the optical correction of astigmatism with more than 1 cyl, soft lenses with conic outer surface are used or combinations of a soft and a hard lens (Duosystem). The therapeutic use of soft lenses has as aim: protection of the cornea against mechanical irritation, release of pain, protracted administration output of medicaments. Further indications for use: aseptic corneal inflammation and corneal defects.", "Meal patterns following changes in procurement cost for rats with fornix transection.\nThe purpose of the present study was to explore the effects of a varied procurement cost on the foraging behavior of rats with fornix transection. An operant analog of foraging requirements was used to examine the feeding patterns of the animals under free feeding, low procurement cost (FR5), and high procurement cost (FR80) situations, in an environment with minimal sensory distraction. It was found that animals with fornix transection did not differ from control rats in general consumption. Both groups were also able to adapt their feeding behavior to the varied procurement cost. As the procurement cost increased, the number of meals consumed decreased while the meal duration increased. The meal patterns themselves were different for the fornix transected animals and the control group. Animals with fornix transections ate more meals over the course of a day than did control animals; their meals were of a longer duration, and their intermeal intervals were shorter than those of control animals. During the course of a meal, the rats with fornix transections took a larger number of breaks, during which they drank, explored, or engaged in activities other than eating. These differences in the feeding patterns were seen across all procurement cost levels. The data support the possibility of hippocampal involvement in behavioral organization or sequencing.", "Thalamic reticular input to the rat visual thalamus: a single fiber study using biocytin as an anterograde tracer.\nThis study describes the axonal projections of single thalamic reticular (TR) neurons within the visual thalamus in rats. Experiments were performed under urethane anesthesia and reticular cells were labeled by extracellular or juxtacellular microiontophoretic applications of biocytin. The axonal arborizations of 19 TR cells projecting to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (DLG) or to the lateral dorsal/lateral posterior complex (LD/LP) were reconstructed from serial horizontal sections. It was found that single TR cells projected within the limits of a single thalamic nucleus, either the DLG or the LD/LP complex, where their terminal fields formed rostrocaudally oriented rods (length: approximately 800 microns; diameter: approximately 100 microns) densely packed with grape-like boutons and varicosities. In addition, none of the labeled TR cells possessed recurrent axonal collaterals that ramified within the reticular complex itself. The functional implications of these morphological data for the synchronization of thalamic oscillations are discussed.", "Investigation of the molecular structure of the human stratum corneum ceramides [NP] and [EOS] by mass spectrometry.\nThe aim of this study was to characterize the two ceramide (CER) subclasses CER[NP] and CER[EOS] of human stratum corneum and to identify the chemical structures of their subspecies. High-performance thin-layer chromatography and normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography were used for the separation of CER fractions, whereas nanoelectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was applied to investigate the chemical structures in detail. Thus, CER[EOS] fragmentation revealed that in addition to linoleic acid other esterified fatty acids occur in the \u03c9-position. Of particular interest is the identification of a 17:2 fatty acid located in this part of the molecule. Several subspecies of CER[NP], including subspecies with odd numbers of carbon atoms in both chains, the non-\u03b1-hydroxylated fatty acid moiety (part N) and the phytosphingosine (part P), were identified. Furthermore, it was found that 12% of CER[NP] subspecies have an odd number of carbon atoms in both chains of the molecule. Similar results were obtained for CER[EOS]. Both the esterified fatty acid (part E) and the sphingosine base (part S) were found to contain odd-numbered chain lengths. These results underline the heterogeneity of the CER composition in the stratum corneum lipid bilayer.", "Structure-function relationship of the A1 domain of von Willebrand factor.\nvon Willebrand factor (vWF) is a multimeric glycoprotein composed of multiple homologous domains. The A1 domain contains a remarkably large disulfide loop of 185 amino acids (Cys 509-695) which plays a key role in promoting platelet adhesion to the subendothelium. Following the initial binding of the A1 domain to the subendothelium, a conformational change occurs which allows its binding to platelet GPIb. In an attempt to further understand the structure-function relationship of the A1 domain, we analyzed 1) the functional properties of recombinant vWF mutated on either Cys 509 or 695 and 2) the reactivity of a monoclonal antibody (MoAb B724) with vWF conformations interacting with GPIb. Our data underline the crucial role of the 509-695 disulfide bond in the binding of vWF to GPIb and discriminate the specificity of each Cys in this binding. They also indicate that two different conformations of the A1 loop, with high or low affinity for MoAb B724, allow the exposure of its GPIb-binding site. Since the low affinity conformation is observed in type 2B vWF, MoAb B724 appears as a useful tool to probe this type of von Willebrand disease (vWD).", "Fine-needle aspiration cytology in the management of gynecologic oncology patients.\nFine-needle aspiration cytology has received little attention by physicians involved in the care of gynecologic oncology patients. Concerns over diagnostic accuracy and complications such as rupture of cystic ovarian tumors with resultant tumor dissemination have limited the technique's utilization. Recent studies have shown the method to have a diagnostic accuracy (percent of neoplasms correctly categorized as benign or malignant) of approximately 95% for ovarian tumors [2-8]. The method is generally free of major complication when patients are properly selected, but severe pelvic infections have followed transvaginal or transrectal puncture of cystic ovarian neoplasms, resulting in a complication rate of about 1.6% [28]. Presently, FNA of ovarian tumors has a role in the workup of cystic lesions in young women where epithelial malignancies are unlikely and preservation of ovarian function is highly desirable. In peri- or postmenopausal women with adnexal masses, operative intervention is appropriate in most cases. Sevin and colleagues defined four clinical situations where FNA is useful [16]. These are 1) workup of primary neoplasms, 2) biopsy of superficial masses in patients with known prior disease, 3) follow-up of irradiated patients, and 4) follow-up of patients undergoing chemotherapy. From the available data, FNA has an accuracy of approximately 90% [10,18] and a low complication rate. The technique is an excellent method for the detection of recurrent or metastatic disease in patients being followed for gynecologic malignancies. When FNA is used for the investigation of newly discovered adnexal masses, patient selection is critical. FNA is helpful in carefully selected young women with cystic ovarian masses. However, its utility is limited in peri- or postmenopausal women with solid and solid-cystic adnexal masses, because these should be investigated by operative intervention.", "Antibiotic resistome in a landfill leachate treatment plant and effluent-receiving river.\nLandfills leachate contained diverse antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Treated landfill leachate effluent could enter into the downstream environments, leading to the dissemination of ARGs, which might pose a health risk to public. Here, we used high-throughput qPCR to characterize the resistome and 16S rRNA-based Illumina sequencing to analyze the bacterial community in a leachate treatment plant and the river near the landfill. A total of 91 ARGs and 5 mobile genetic elements were detected. Leachate treatment process significantly changed the profiles of resistome and bacterial community structures. Similar bacterial community structure and ARG profiles were detected between effluent and downstream river, which were both dominated by multidrug and beta-lactams resistance genes and harbored higher ARG relative abundance than that in upstream river. In particular, seven ARGs were detected both in effluent and downstream river samples but not detected in upstream river, including genes encoding resistance to vancomycin (vanXD and vanSB) and carbapenem (cphA and blaGES), which implied the effects of the effluent on its receiving river. This study highlights the risk of discharge of processed landfill leachate in dissemination of antibiotic resistance determinants to the environments, and suggests an urgent need for surveillance of ARGs and development of techniques to mitigate the risk.", "Central hemodynamic modifications in diabetes mellitus.\nArterial stiffness in hypertension is markedly influenced by age, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate, whereas factors influencing this parameter in diabetes mellitus are not yet fully understood. The aim of our study was to compare central hemodynamics in diabetics (n = 126) versus non-diabetic controls (n = 203), most of whom were hypertensive, and with similar MAP. Anthropometric, laboratory and clinical measurements were collected. Hemodynamic parameters (central blood pressure, aortic pulse wave velocity [PWV], augmentation index [AIx] and pulse pressure amplification [PPA]) were measured using applanation tonometry. PWV and AIx were significantly higher in diabetics, after adjustment for age, gender, MAP, and heart rate. After further adjustment for metabolic syndrome, only the difference in PWV persisted (P < 0.0001). PPA was marginally altered though not significantly. In diabetics, PWV did not correlate with MAP, suggesting that other structural alterations, resulting from insulin resistance, may account for diabetic arterial stiffening to a greater extent than, and independently of, blood pressure. Chronic treatment with insulin was associated with increased PWV, independently of blood pressure, diabetes control and duration, or other common confounding variables. In conclusion, hypertensive diabetics had greater arterial stiffness than hypertensive controls. In diabetes, multiple factors affect arterial stiffening independently of hemodynamic status. Notably, insulin therapy (IT) is associated with more severe arterial stiffness, suggesting a consistent relationship between these parameters. It remains to be determined whether IT should be considered as a marker of diabetes severity that leads to increased arterial stiffness, or whether it has a direct/indirect effect on arterial wall modifications.", "Prevalence of bovine viral diarrhea virus infections in alpacas in the United States.\nTo determine the prevalence of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)-infected alpaca herds in the United States and investigate factors associated with seropositive herd status and, subsequently, determine the proportion of animals within seropositive alpaca herds that are persistently infected (PI) carriers for BVDV, obtain information regarding previous herd exposure to BVDV, determine titers of anti-BVDV antibodies of dams, and ascertain whether individual seropositive crias had received supplemental colostrum at birth. Prevalence study. 63 alpaca herds with >or= 12 registered female alpacas. 250 alpaca breeders were randomly selected from 562 eligible herds listed in the Alpaca Owner and Breeders Association membership directory and mailed a voluntary participation request. Sixty-three alpaca breeders participated in the study. From each herd, blood samples from >or= 4 crias were tested for BVDV, BVDV RNA, and serum neutralizing antibodies against BVDV. A region of the genome of BVDV recovered from PI crias was sequenced to determine genetic homology. Among the 63 herds, 16 (25.4%) had seropositive crias and 4 (6.3%) had PI crias. Infections in 3 of the 4 herds with PI crias were linked as evidence by the genetic homologies of viruses. In addition to PI crias, feeding supplemental colostrum was associated with herd seropositivity. Results confirmed the importance of BVDV infections in alpacas in the United States and highlighted the importance of determining the BVDV infection status of animals before they are commingled to limit exposure of herds to BVDV infection.", "Comparative molecular evolution of primary (Buchnera) and secondary symbionts of aphids based on two protein-coding genes.\nA+T content, phylogenetic relationships, codon usage, evolutionary rates, and ratio of synonymous versus non-synonymous substitutions have been studied in partial sequences of the atpD and aroQ/pheA genes of primary ( Buchnera) and secondary symbionts of aphids and a set of selected non-symbiotic bacteria, belonging to the five subdivisions of the Proteobacteria. Compared to the homologous genes of the last group, both genes belonging to Buchnera behave in a similar way, showing a higher A+T content, forming a monophyletic group, a loss in codon bias, especially in third base position, an evolutionary acceleration and an increase in the number of non-synonymous substitutions, confirming previous results reported elsewhere for other genes. When available, these properties have been partly observed with the secondary symbionts, but with values that are intermediate between Buchnera and free living Proteobacteria. They show high A+T content, but not as high as Buchnera, a non-solved phylogenetic position between Buchnera, and the other gamma-Proteobacteria, a loss in codon bias, again not as high as in Buchnera and a significant evolutionary acceleration in the case of the three atpD genes, but not when considering aroQ/pheA genes. These results give support to the hypothesis that they are symbionts at different stages of the symbiotic accommodation to the host.", "Collapsing and non-collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in kidney transplants.\nThe aetiological and clinical associations of collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (cFSGS) following kidney transplantation (KTx) are poorly described. In this study, post-transplant cFSGS and non-collapsing FSGS (ncFSGS) were compared in recent KTx recipients. Evidence for intragraft viral infection was sought. Twenty-nine cases of post-KTx FSGS were identified and classified as cFSGS (n = 10) or ncFSGS (n = 19). Biopsies were scored using Banff '97 criteria and subjected to in situ hybridization (ISH) for parvovirus B19 (pvB19), simian virus 40 (SV40) and BK virus (BKV). cFSGS and ncFSGS patients were comparable for age, gender, weight, delayed function, human leucocyte antigen (HLA) matching, acute rejection and median time to diagnosis. Deceased donor source was more common among cFSGS cases (70 vs 32%, P = 0.05). FSGS was recurrent in 2/10 cFSGS cases compared with 8/19 ncFSGS (P = NS). cFSGS was associated with more proteinuria (11.9 vs 7.2 g/day, P = 0.05) and higher serum creatinine (4.2 vs 1.9 mg/dl, P = 0.0001) at diagnosis. Plasmapheresis was used in two out of 10 cFSGS and seven out of 19 ncFSGS cases with treatment response in 0 of two and three of seven, respectively. Graft loss was more rapid with cFSGS compared with ncFSGS (P = 0.02). Histologically, cFSGS was associated with more severe chronic vascular abnormalities. All biopsies were negative for pvB19, SV40 and BKV by ISH. cFSGS following KTx presents with higher proteinuria, diminished renal function, more severe vascular disease and higher rate of graft loss compared with the non-collapsing form. There was no evidence for infection by pvB19 or polyomaviruses.", "The in vivo control of prostaglandin H synthase-2 messenger ribonucleic acid expression in the human amnion at parturition.\nProstaglandin H synthase-2 (PGHS-2) activity and mRNA rise in the human amnion at late gestation, contributing to the increase in intrauterine PG production crucial for labor and delivery. In the present investigation we have determined the mechanism that controls amniotic PGHS-2 mRNA levels in vivo at term parturition. Amnion membranes were collected after elective cesarean section (n = 20), and after spontaneous labor (n = 20). PGHS-2 relative gene transcription rates were determined by transcriptional run-on, and PGHS-2 mRNA and heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) relative abundance were measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The PGHS-2 mRNA degradation rate was determined by incubating amnion in the presence of the transcription inhibitor 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside. The dynamics of PGHS-2 hnRNA and mRNA abundance were characterized in 0- to 24-h tissue incubations. The PGHS-2 relative gene transcription rate was a significant (P < 0.05) predictor of PGHS-2 hnRNA and mRNA abundance, and PGHS-2 hnRNA was also a predictor (P < 0.01) of PGHS-2 mRNA levels both before and after labor. Interestingly, even though PGHS-2 gene activity remained unchanged, PGHS-2 mRNA abundance increased with labor and displayed constitutive stability before and after labor. PGHS-2 mRNA levels spontaneously increased by 400% (P < 0.01) upon incubation for 24 h, whereas the transcription rate dropped by 95% during the first 2 h, then rebounded significantly between 6-24 h. Thus, PGHS-2 mRNA abundance is transcriptionally controlled in term amnion. Labor does not increase PGHS-2 gene activity or mRNA stability. The PGHS-2 gene is probably induced before labor by a factor(s) originating in the amnion membrane, and the resulting stable mRNA accumulates progressively in the tissue throughout labor and delivery.", "Cardiac output, wedge pressure, and oxygen delivery.\nThe primary goal of the intensive care clinician can be said to be to optimize global DO2. This approach is the primary means by which the greatest killers of the critically ill patient (sepsis, SIRS, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome) may be addressed at present. Optimizing DO2 means delivering just enough to meet the patient's needs, because therapeutic measures taken to increase DO2 are all associated with some degree of risk. When used correctly, the PAC can allow the clinician to determine if DO2 is optimal and, if not, what steps might be best suited to improve on it. Newer generations of PACs are becoming available and can provide valuable additional insights into a patient's cardiovascular status. Nearly all attempts to increase DO2 address one or more of a relatively short list of variables. The specific endpoints of therapy need to be tailored to the individual patient but include clinical, metabolic, organ function, and hemodynamic markers. As clinicians expand our understanding of the key elements found in survivors of critical illness, it is hoped that this knowledge translates into better outcomes.", "Casino Jack Abramoff and Ralph Reed Don\u2019t let the smiles fool ya. Masters of Sleaze by David Brooks Op-ed in the New York Times March 22, 2005 Down in the depths of the netherworld, where Tammany Hall grafters and Chicago ward heelers gather amid spittoons and brass railings, a reverential silence now spreads across the communion.

A 2011 survey of healthcare workers presents an opportunity to examine factors associated with adherence among 1094 hospital nurses who administered ADs. Data for these hypothesis-generating analyses were taken from an anonymous, web-based survey of healthcare workers. Regression modeling was used to examine associations between a number of predictors (engineering controls, work practices, nurse perceptions, and nurse and hospital characteristics) and three outcomes reported by nurses: use of personal protective equipment (PPE); activities performed with gloves previously worn to administer ADs; and spills of ADs. Adherence to safe handling guidelines was not universal, and AD spills were reported by 9.5% of nurses during the week prior to the survey. Familiarity with safe handling guidelines and training in safe handling were associated with more reported PPE use. Nurse-perceived availability of PPE was associated with more reported PPE use and lower odds of reported spills. Use of closed system drug-transfer devices and luer-lock fittings also decreased the odds of self-reported AD spills, while more frequent AD administration increased the risk. AD administration frequency was also associated with performing more activities with gloves previously worn to administer ADs, and nurse perception of having adequate time for taking safety precautions with fewer such activities. The results suggest that training and familiarity with guidelines for safe handling of ADs, adequate time to adhere to guidelines, and availability of PPE and certain engineering controls are key to ensuring adherence to safe handling practices. Further assessment of training components and engineering controls would be useful for tailoring interventions targeting these areas.", "Three-Dimensional Graphene/Ag Aerogel for Durable and Stable Li Metal Anodes in Carbonate-Based Electrolytes.\nThe use of Li metal as the anode for Li-based batteries has attracted considerable attention due to its ultrahigh energy density. However, the formation of Li dendrites, uneven deposition, and huge volume changes hinder its reliable implementation. These issues become much more severe in commercial carbonate-based electrolytes than in ether-based electrolytes. Herein, a rationally designed three-dimensional graphene/Ag aerogel (3D G-Ag aerogel) is proposed for Li metal anodes with long cycle life in carbonate-based electrolytes. The modified lithiophilic nature of G-Ag aerogel, realized through decoration with Ag NPs, effectively decreases the energy barrier for Li nucleation, regulating uniform Li deposition behavior. Moreover, the highly flexible, conductive 3D porous architecture with hierarchical mesopores and macropores can readily accommodate deposited Li and ensures the integrity of the conductive network during cycling. Consequently, high coulombic efficiency (over 93.5 %) and a significantly long cycle life (1589 h) over 200 cycles, with a relatively high cycling capacity of 2.0 mAh cm-2 , can easily be achieved, even in a carbonate-based electrolyte. Considering the intrinsic high voltage windows of carbonate-based electrolytes, matching the G-Ag aerogel Li metal anode with a high-voltage cathode can be envisaged for the fabrication of high-energy-density Li secondary batteries.", "DNA typing in hereditary disease.\nAn increasing number of hereditary diseases are becoming amenable to diagnosis by analysis of DNA as the responsible genes are located and identified. Gel electrophoresis of DNA fragments plays a central role in the diagnosis of hereditary disease. Electrophoretic separation of differently sized fragments enables the characterization or typing of normal variants which are known to be genetically linked to disease genes. For some diseases it is possible to directly detect mutations by DNA electrophoresis. Deletion mutants may be detected by a restriction fragment of altered size or by a failure to amplify a coding region with the polymerase chain reaction. Carriers of small deletions, involving a few base pairs, may be identified by DNA amplification which produces heteroduplexes that show characteristic, anomalous electrophoretic migration. Mutations that alter restriction sites also alter the sizes of restriction fragments. Common disease mutations that alter a single base pair may be detected using a pair of reactions with normal and mutant oligonucleotides under conditions where a perfect match is necessary for hybridization, amplification or ligation. Alternatively a mismatched oligonucleotide primer may be designed to generate a restriction site with either the normal or mutant allele, following DNA amplification. Finally a number of techniques are available that are useful as screening tools for novel mutations.", "Laminin alpha chains in colon carcinoma cell lines: detection of a truncated laminin alpha1 mRNA in Caco-2 cells.\nChanges in basement membrane structure are known to accompany carcinoma formation. We analyzed laminin alpha1 and alpha5 chains in colon carcinoma cell lines. Variable levels of the Mr 380,000 alpha5 laminin protein and 11-kb alpha5 laminin mRNA were noted. In contrast, laminin alpha1 protein was not synthesized by any of the colon carcinoma cell lines tested. Northern blotting revealed expression of a 10-kb laminin alpha1 mRNA only in control cells. Unexpectedly, expression of a truncated laminin alpha1 message of approximately 8 kb was found in one cell line, the adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2. By RT-PCR and Northern blotting a deletion in the laminin alpha1 mRNA was mapped to the 5' end, spanning nucleotides 41-1835. The deletion spans the translation start site, explaining the complete lack of the protein. Southern blotting of genomic Caco-2 DNA did not reveal any larger truncation, suggesting a point mutation manifested at the posttranscriptional level. The identified truncation is the first genetic defect described for the laminin alpha1 chain and suggests that mutations in the LAM A1 gene might underlie the observed lack of the laminin alpha1 chain in some colon carcinomas.", "This invention relates to corrugated bodies and more particularly to a prestressed panel and a method of constructing such panels from sheets of flexible material.\nIt is known to form sheets of paper into cardboard wherein a sheet of corrugated paper is glued between a pair of paper cover sheets. The process for forming the cardboard includes wrinkling the corrugated sheet between the nip of a pair of meshing corrugation rollers which permanently wrinkles the paper sheet which is thereafter sandwiched between and glued to the other sheets of paper. It is also known to form permanently corrugated metal sheets by the rolling process for use as roof structures on certain buildings and for other purposes. When paper is corrugated, since it has substantially little yield strength with no flexibility, it is quickly deformed permanently. It thus cannot be prestressed for uses where a prestressed material may be required. Metals have a very high yield strength with little or no flexibility below its yield strength and is permanently deformed when corrugated. Thus, it too is not in a prestressed condition if used in a honey comb type structure. Synthetic plastics, such as polyethylene plastics and vinyl plastics, on the other hand are generally flexible. Unless corrugating rollers are heated so as to heat and deform the plastic sheets fed thereto, these materials revert to their original shapes or fail so that they have not been utilized as corrugated panels or the like. By forming prestressed corrugated panels from synthetic plastic materials such as polyethylene or certain metals a relatively strong structure can be constructed which can have good insulating qualities for use in buildings, especially if the voids between the corrugation ridges and furrows are filled with a material having high insulating properties such as polyurethane foam.", "Breastfeeding Support: A Geographic Perspective on Access and Equity.\nClinical lactation professionals, breastfeeding peer counseling, and mother-to-mother support are important sources of information and guidance for helping mothers initiate and maintain breastfeeding in the early weeks, months, and years postpartum. However, there is limited information concerning the geographic barriers that mothers face when seeking this support. Research aim: This study aimed to identify the geographic barriers to breastfeeding support, delineate gaps in access, assess inequities in the distribution of local support, and highlight the underlying differences in access and equity for different demographic and socioeconomic groups. The locations of formal breastfeeding support resources were collected for the state of Ohio for 2016 and were combined with demographic and socioeconomic estimates and derived transportation catchment areas to conduct an analysis of spatial access and equity. Significant geographic gaps in formal breastfeeding support exist within the state of Ohio. Although urban areas benefit from a higher density of support options, including a wide variety of clinical experts and mother-to-mother support groups, inequities in exurban and rural areas were more strongly aligned with socioeconomic status than geography. In particular, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children offices in rural Ohio offer breastfeeding support to income-qualifying mothers but cannot address the needs of mothers who do not qualify. Spatial analytical approaches facilitate a more nuanced view of access and equity to breastfeeding support options, helping to both decompose important structural differences in the state of Ohio and identify locations that could benefit from additional breastfeeding support resources.", "Visual detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus using CRISPR-Cas13a.\nPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has varied constantly and circulated in the pig industry worldwide. The prevention and control of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is complicated. A visual, sensitive and specific diagnostic method is advantageous to the control of PRRS. The collateral cleavage activity of LwCas13a is activated to degrade non-targeted RNA, when crRNA of LwCas13a bond to target RNA. The enhanced Cas13a detection is the combination of collateral cleavage activity of LwCas13a and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). In this study, the enhanced Cas13a detection for PRRSV was established. The novel method was an isothermal detection at 37\u00b0C, and the detection can be used for real-time analysis or visual readout. The detection limit of the enhanced Cas13a detection was 172 copies/\u03bcl, and there were no cross-reactions with porcine circovirus 2, porcine parvovirus, classical swine fever virus and pseudorabies virus. The enhanced Cas13a detection can work well in clinical samples. In summary, a visual, sensitive and specific nucleic acid detection method based on CRISPR-Cas13a was developed for PRRSV.", "Veterans Administration Cooperative Dental Implant Study--comparisons between fixed partial dentures supported by blade-vent implants and removable partial dentures. Part II: Comparisons of success rates and periodontal health between two treatment modalities.\nFive Veterans Administration centers have participated in a study to determine whether fixed partial dentures (FPDs) supported by blade implants offer an acceptable substitute for mandibular unilateral or bilateral distal-base extension removable partial dentures (RPDs). The study design and methodology have been described in Part I. A total of 232 patients received comprehensive dental care including RPDs for 118 patients and FPDs for 114. Prespecified criteria determined treatment failures. During the 60-month period, treatment failures occurred in 19 FPD patients and 30 RPD patients. Ten FPD failures occurred before and nine after the FPD insertion. Five RPD failures were caused by abutment tooth loss and 25 for not using the RPD while eating. Life table analysis showed 5-year success rates of 84.2% for the FPD and 74% for the RPD. The 17.9% higher FPD success rate in Kennedy class II patients was both statistically and clinically significant. Excluding the 10 early failures, the 5-year FPD success rate was 91.5%. Of the 170 attempted implants, 26 failed, including 12 before the FPD fabrication. Radiographic assessments by a panel of three judges showed no bone deterioration during baseline to 60 months in 29.6%, slight in 25.4%, moderate in 15.9%, marked in 27%, and severe deterioration in 2.1% of the implant posts.", "MYC in pancreatic cancer: novel mechanistic insights and their translation into therapeutic strategies.\nOwing to its aggressiveness, late detection and marginal therapeutic accessibility, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a most challenging malignant disease. Despite scientific progress in the understanding of the mechanisms that underly PDAC initiation and progression, the successful translation of experimental findings into effective new therapeutic strategies remains a largely unmet need. The oncogene MYC is activated in many PDAC cases and is a master regulator of vital cellular processes. Excellent recent studies have shed new light on the tremendous functions of MYC in cancer and identified inhibition of MYC as a likewise beneficial and demanding effort. This review will focus on mechanisms that contribute to deregulation of MYC expression in pancreatic carcinogenesis and progression and will summarize novel biological findings from recent in vivo models. Finally, we provide a perspective, how regulation of MYC in PDAC may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches.", "Phosphacarborane chemistry: the 7,8,9,11-, 7,9,8,10- and 7,8,9,10-isomers of nido-P2C2B7H9--diphosphadicarbaborane analogues of 7,8,9,10-C4B7H11.\nThe reaction between the carborane arachno-4,6-C2B7H13 (1) and PCl3 in dichloromethane in the presence of a \"proton sponge\" (PS = 1,8-dimethylaminonaphthalene) resulted in the isolation of the eleven-vertex nido-diphosphadicarbaboranes 7,8,9,11-P2C2B7H, (2) and 3-Cl-7,8,11-P2C2B7H, (3-Cl-2) in yields of 54 and 7%, respectively. Replacement of the PS by NEt3 in the same reaction gave diphosphadicarbaboranes 2 and 3-CI-2 together with the isomeric species nido-7,9,8,10-P2C2B7H, (3) in yields of 28, 15 and 3%, respectively. The reaction between the isomeric carborane arachno-4,5-C2B7H13 (4) and PCl3 in dichloromethane in the presence of PS gave the asymmetrical isomer, nido-7,8,9,10-P2C2B7H, (5). along with the chloro derivatives 4-Cl-7,8,9,10-P2C2B7H8 (4-Cl-5) and 11-Cl-7,8,9,10-PC2B7,H8 (11-Cl-5) (yields of 21, 1 and 13%, respectively). The structures of the chlorinated derivatives 3-Cl2 and 11 -Cl-5 were determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. In addition, the structures of all compounds isolated were geometry-optimised and confirmed by comparison of experimental 11B chemical shifts with those calculated by the GIAO-SCF/II//RMP2(fc)/6-31G* method. The calculations also include the structure and 11B NMR shifts of the isomer nido-7,10,8,9-P2C2B7H9 (6) which has not yet been isolated.", "Diagnostic performance of extrinsic apoptosis pathway in hepatitis C virus patients: apoptosis fibrosis crosstalk.\nLiver fibrosis assessment and evaluation of disease severity in hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients provides useful information for therapeutic decisions. Chronic HCV infection is associated with increased levels of peripheral T cell apoptosis. The aim was to study whether peripheral blood T lymphocyte apoptosis markers may contribute to clinical progression, and develop a simple index based on combination of apoptosis and routine biomarkers for accurate evaluation of fibrosis stages in HCV patients. Peripheral blood T lymphocytes were isolated from 72 patients with hepatitis C virus and 25 healthy control individuals. Serum samples were collected at time of liver biopsy. Liver fibrosis was tested in biopsies using the Metavair score system. Stepwise linear discriminate analysis and area under receiver-operating characteristic curves were utilized to produce a predictive score comprising significant apoptosis biomarkers. A novel score named apoptosis fibrosis index (AFI) was created on the basis of a combination of CD8/Annexin, albumin and platelets. The multivariate discriminate analysis selected a score based on absolute values of the three biochemical markers; score = 5.8 + 0.008\u00d7CD8/Annexin-V (%) - 1.4\u00d7Albumin (g/dl) - 0.001\u00d7Platelet count (10/L), where 5.8 considered numerical constant. AFI produce an area under the curve of one for significant fibrosis, 0.80 for advanced fibrosis, and 0.889 for cirrhosis. Apoptosis biomarkers in HCV patients were associated with liver fibrosis. AFI score, a novel noninvasive test, can be used easily for the prediction of liver fibrosis stage and may decrease the need for liver biopsy in hepatitis C virus Egyptian patients.", "Bidimensional measurement of nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a simple method to predict outcomes.\nTo determine whether the standard techniques of measuring tumour size could be applied to the measurement of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A retrospective review of case notes from the Buddhist Tzu Chi Dalin General Hospital archives was performed. The Buddhist Tzu Chi Dalin General Hospital is a teaching hospital in Taiwan. All patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were included. Ninety-eight patients with newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma were treated with high-dose radiotherapy and chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. Computed tomography-derived primary tumour volume, bidimensional measurement and unidimensional measurement were recorded. Intrarater reliability was measured. To examine the validity of various measurements, we estimated the Spearman's correlation co-efficients between those measurements and the gold standard value (primary tumour volume measurement with summation of area techniques). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed and Kaplan-Meier survival curves constructed. There was a significant association between primary tumour volume and bidimensional measurement with respect to tumour size at diagnosis (Spearman's correlation co-efficient = 0.845, P < 0.001). Using age, gender, chemotherapy status and T-stage as covariate, bidimensional measurement remained an independent prognostic factor for any relapse [Hazard ratio = (HR) 1.066; P = 0.029], and overall survival (HR = 1.097; P = 0.007). Patients with small bidimensional measurement (<10 cm(2)) had better prognosis and fewer recurrences. When using simple measurement to evaluate nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the bidimensional measurement may be used to measure size at diagnosis. Patients with small bidimensional measurement had better prognosis and fewer recurrences. Bidimensional measurement may be further considered to improve the current staging system.", "Genetic Risk Factors for Radiation Vasculopathy.\nThe purpose of this study was to perform a genome-wide scan for polymorphisms associated with risk of vision loss from radiation complications in patients treated with proton beam irradiation for choroidal melanoma. We identified a cohort of 126 patients at high risk of radiation complications due to tumor location within 2 disc diameters of the optic nerve and/or fovea who provided a blood sample to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Uveal Melanoma Repository. Controls (n = 76) were defined as patients with visual acuity 20/40 or better 3 years after treatment. Cases (n = 50) were selected as patients with visual acuity 20/200 or worse due to radiation damage 3 years after treatment. Genotyping of these samples was performed using the Omni 2.5 chip (Illumina, Inc.). Hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 3.749, P = 0.0009), visual acuity at diagnosis of choroidal melanoma (OR = 1.031, P = 0.002), tumor distance to fovea (OR = 0.341, P = 6.52E-05), tumor distance to optic disc (OR = 0.481, P = 5.41E-05), and height of tumor (OR = 1.704, P = 0.0069) were associated with poor vision (20/200 or worse). Individual single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was performed controlling for the risk factors identified using stepwise regression and the first principal component. Although this analysis determined that there were 74,529 nominally significant SNPs (P < 0.05), there were no SNPs that reached genome-wide significance (P < 5E-08). The SNP reaching the highest significance level (P < 1E-04) was rs11678387, located on chromosome 2, intergenic between EPB41L5/RALB (P = 4.43E-05). Visual loss from radiation vasculopathy after treatment for choroidal melanoma is not only related to tumor location but may be influenced by hypertension and possibly genetic factors.", "Genetic and functional characterization of a novel GH10 endo-\u03b2- 1,4-xylanase with a ricin-type \u03b2-trefoil domain-like domain from Luteimicrobium xylanilyticum HY-24.\nThe gene (1488-bp) encoding a novel GH10 endo-\u03b2-1,4-xylanase (XylM) consisting of an N-terminal catalytic GH10 domain and a C-terminal ricin-type \u03b2-trefoil lectin domain-like (RICIN) domain was identified from Luteimicrobium xylanilyticum HY-24. The GH10 domain of XylM was 72% identical to that of Micromonospora lupini endo-\u03b2-1,4-xylanase and the RICIN domain was 67% identical to that of Actinospica robiniae hypothetical protein. The recombinant enzyme (rXylM: 49kDa) exhibited maximum activity toward beechwood xylan at 65\u00b0C and pH 6.0, while the optimum temperature and pH of its C-terminal truncated mutant (rXylM\u25b3RICIN: 35kDa) were 45\u00b0C and 5.0, respectively. After pre-incubation of 1h at 60\u00b0C, rXylM retained over 80% of its initial activity, but the thermostability of rXylM\u25b3RICIN was sharply decreased at temperatures exceeding 40\u00b0C. The specific activity (254.1Umg-1) of rXylM toward oat spelts xylan was 3.4-fold higher than that (74.8Umg-1) of rXylM\u25b3RICIN when the same substrate was used. rXylM displayed superior binding capacities to lignin and insoluble polysaccharides compared to rXylM\u25b3RICIN. Enzymatic hydrolysis of \u03b2-1,4-d-xylooligosaccharides (X3-X6) and birchwood xylan yielded X3 as the major product. The results suggest that the RICIN domain in XylM might play an important role in substrate-binding and biocatalysis.", "Social support moderates posttraumatic stress and general distress after disaster.\nSocial support buffers the negative impact of stressful events. Less, however, is known about the characteristics of this association in the context of disaster and findings have been discrepant regarding direct and buffering effects. This study tested whether the protective effects of social support differed across levels of exposure severity (i.e., buffered distress) and assessed whether the buffering effect differed between event-specific and general distress. Participants were 4,600 adult Swedish tourists (44% of invited; 55% women) repatriated within 3 weeks after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. A survey 14 months after the disaster included the Crisis Support Scale, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Social support buffered the negative impact of exposure on both outcomes. The support and distress association ranged from very small in participants with low exposure to moderate in those with high exposure (\u03b7(p)(2) = .004 to .053). The buffering effect was not found to differ between the IES-R and GHQ-12, F(2, 4589) = 0.87, p = .42. The findings suggest that social support moderates the stressor-distress relationship after disasters. This study might help explain discrepant findings and point to refinements of postdisaster interventions.", "Results with Kudo elbow prostheses in non-traumatic indications : a study of 36 cases.\nWith a mean follow-up of 62 months, we reviewed 13 Kudo type 4 and 23 Kudo type 5 elbow prostheses implanted for non-traumatic indications in 30 patients. Clinical results were assessed with the Mayo Clinic Performance Index (MCPI) taking into account pain, mobility, stability and daily activities. Postoperatively, pain disappeared or decreased, ulnar nerve dysfunction was improved and the functional status was significantly improved. The average range of motion increased by 7.8 degrees in extension and by 11.5 degrees in flexion; pronation and supination remained unchanged. Clinically, 89% of patients scored poorly on the MCPI preoperatively, whereas 61% had excellent or good scores postoperatively. Twenty-two patients out of 30 were satisfied. There were two early prosthetic dislocations, and prosthetic instability, assessed clinically, was found in 6 cases (17%). The rate of loosening was 28% (10/36) and seven elbows were revised. Metallosis, loosening and instability were significantly correlated. The survival rate of 82% at 54 months (SD = 7) is lower than that reported for non-constrained and semi-constrained prostheses in the literature.", "Prognostic factors and clinical outcomes in adult primary gliosarcoma patients: a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) analysis from 2004 to 2015.\nObjective: Gliosarcoma (GSC), a rare malignant brain tumor, is considered as a variant of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 wild type (IDH1-WT) glioblastoma (GBM). This study aimed to retrospectively analyze the clinical characteristics of GSC and compare whether there are some differences of treatment strategies and outcomes between GSC and GBM patients through Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.Patients and methods: The clinical data of adults diagnosed with primary GSC between 2004 and 2015 were queried from SEER database. The Kaplan-Meier curve and the Cox model were performed to analyze the relationships between clinical parameters and patients' prognosis. Similar analyses were conducted for all primary GBM patients of SEER.Results: In total, 527 GSC and 20,541 GBM patients with complete and valid clinical information were finally enrolled for further analysis. Compared with GBM, GSC owned a proclivity to temporal lobe rather than frontal lobe (p < 0.001), a less conservative extension of resection (EOR) (p < 0.001), and a higher sensitivity to radiotherapy (p < 0.001). As shown by univariate analysis, surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy could prolong the overall survival (OS) time of GSC, but EOR did not confer an advantage to the outcomes of patients, no matter whether combined radio/chemotherapy was given. In multivariate analysis, age more than 60 and lack of radio/chemotherapy were identified as independent risk factors for OS of GSC patients.Conclusions: Our study found that although EOR seemed to be important to GBM, the extent of surgery did not show a clear relationship with the improved prognosis of GSC. Additionally, radiotherapy and chemotherapy could prolong patients' survival time significantly, which suggests a more positive role of them in treating GSC and needs further investigations.", "In order to apply a coating of a uniform thickness to an object, a coating method has been conventionally employed using a spray pattern formed by a coating material sprayed from a spray gun. Layer coating is conducted using film forming equipment comprising an air conditioner, a spray gun, etc., in a manner as shown in, for example, FIG. 7. In other words, a spray pattern 153 is formed by spraying a coating material from a spray gun that is fixed in the center of a coating booth 151, and moving an object 152, which is placed beneath the spray gun, by using an object conveyor (not shown) up and down at a predetermined speed, while shifting the object in the direction shown by the arrow S (i.e., from left to right in the figure) at a predetermined distance.\nIt is also possible to conduct layer coating by forming the spray pattern 153 by spraying a coating material from the spray gun to an object 152 fixed in the center of the coating booth 151, as shown in FIG. 8, using a spray gun that is disposed above the object 152, and moving the spray gun up and down at a predetermined speed while shifting it in the direction shown by the arrow S (i.e., from left to right in the figure) at a predetermined distance.", "CHIP attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis by promoting NFATc3 proteasomal degradation.\nCarboxyl-terminus of Hsc70 interacting protein (CHIP) is a chaperone-dependent E3-ubiquitin ligase with important function in protein quality control system. In the current research endeavor, we have investigated the putative role of CHIP in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced cardiomyopathies. Basically, H9c2 cardiomyoblasts were transfected with CHIP for 24 hr, and thereafter, treated with LPS for 12 hr. Concomitantly, western blot analysis, actin staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and coimmunoprecipitation studies were performed to investigate the underlying intricacies. Interestingly, western blot analysis revealed that the expression of hypertrophy and apoptosis-related proteins were considerably reduced following overexpression of CHIP. Moreover, Actin staining and TUNEL assay further ascertained the attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis following overexpression of CHIP respectively. These aspects instigate the role of CHIP in attenuation of LPS-induced cardiomyopathies. Additionally and importantly, co-immunoprecipitation and western blot studies revealed that CHIP plausibly promotes degradation of nuclear factor of activated T cells 3 (NFATc3) through ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Taken together, our study reveals that CHIP attenuates LPS-induced cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis perhaps by promoting NFATc3 proteasomal degradation.", "Short-term clinical outcomes among patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation in Switzerland: the Swiss TAVI registry.\nTo evaluate short-term clinical outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using CE-mark approved devices in Switzerland. The Swiss TAVI registry is a national, prospective, multicentre, monitored cohort study evaluating clinical outcomes in consecutive patients undergoing TAVI at cardiovascular centres in Switzerland. From February 2011 to March 2013, a total of 697 patients underwent TAVI for native aortic valve stenosis (98.1%), degenerative aortic bioprosthesis (1.6%) or severe aortic regurgitation (0.3%). Patients were elderly (82.4\u00b16 years), 52% were females, and the majority highly symptomatic (73.1% NYHA III/IV). Patients with severe aortic stenosis (mean gradient 44.8\u00b117 mmHg, aortic valve area 0.7\u00b10.3 cm\u00b2) were either deemed inoperable or at high risk for conventional surgery (STS 8.2%\u00b17). The transfemoral access was the most frequently used (79.1%), followed by transapical (18.1%), direct aortic (1.7%) and subclavian access (1.1%). At 30 days, rates of all-cause mortality, cerebrovascular events and myocardial infarction were 4.8%, 3.3% and 0.4%, respectively. The most frequently observed adverse events were access-related complications (11.8%), permanent pacemaker implantation (20.5%) and bleeding complications (16.6%). The Swiss TAVI registry is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01368250). The Swiss TAVI registry is a national cohort study evaluating consecutive TAVI procedures in Switzerland. This first outcome report provides favourable short-term clinical outcomes in unselected TAVI patients.", "Zn cluster drifting effect for the formation of ZnO 3D nanoarchitecture.\nMetal catalysts are widely used for nanowire (NW) growth and are one of the essential parameters that dictate the crystal growth phenomena, thus controlling the NW's morphology. Although extensive research has been conducted on catalyst effects, the catalyst drifting effect is generally underestimated for controlling the morphology of nanostructures grown at a relatively high temperature. In this paper, we report a discovery of Zn cluster drifting phenomenon during ZnO vapor deposition. Because of the deposition of ZnO along the drifting path, the dynamic process of cluster drifting could be visualized after the growth. This phenomenon provides a sound explanation of the formation of randomly orientated ZnO nanowall networks. The cluster drifting direction could be intentionally directed by designing the surface inclination, through which a partially parallel aligned ZnO vertical nanofin array was created. This 3D nanoarchitecture would possibly provide a novel configuration for designing high performance integrated nanodevices. The drifting of Zn clusters could be a general phenomenon for most metal catalysts and would provide a new insight into nanofabrication and nanodevice development.", "Trends and determinants of undernutrition among young Kenyan children: Kenya Demographic and Health Survey; 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2008-2009.\nTo report on the trends and determinants of undernutrition among children <5 years old in Kenya. Data from four nationwide Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys, conducted in 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2008-2009, were analysed. The Demographic and Health Survey utilizes a multistage stratified sampling technique. Nationwide covering rural and urban areas in Kenya. The analysis included 4757, 4433, 4892 and 4958 Kenyan children aged <5 years in 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2009-2009, respectively. The prevalence of stunting decreased by 4\u00b76 percentage points from 39\u00b79 % in 1993 to 35\u00b73 % in 2008-2009, while underweight decreased by 2\u00b77 percentage points from 18\u00b77 % in 1993 to 16\u00b70 % in 2008-2009. The effects of household wealth, maternal education and current maternal nutritional status on child nutrition outcomes have changed dynamically in more recent years in Kenya. Inadequate hygiene facilities increased the likelihood of chronic undernutrition in at least three of the surveys. Small size of the child at birth, childhood diarrhoea and male gender increased the likelihood of undernutrition in at least three of the surveys. Childhood undernutrition occurred concurrently with maternal overnutrition in some households. The analysis reveals a slow decline of undernutrition among young children in Kenya over the last three decades. However, stunting and underweight still remain of public health significance. There is evidence of an emerging trend of a malnutrition double burden demonstrated by stunted and underweight children whose mothers are overweight.", "Prospective prediction of O2 consumption from pressure-volume area in dog hearts.\nSystolic pressure-volume area (PVA) is the area circumscribed by the end-systolic pressure-volume (PV) line, the end-diastolic PV curve, and the systolic PV trajectory of the ventricle. PVA represents the total mechanical energy generated by ventricular contraction. Myocardial O2 consumption (VO2) linearly correlates with PVA under different pre- and afterloads in the dog left ventricle. The linear VO2-PVA relation parallel shifts with changes in contractility index Emax. We have retrospectively obtained VO2 = A X PVA + B . Emax + C, where A, B, and C are regression coefficients. We used this equation to prospectively predict VO2 from measured PVA and Emax in a new group of dog left ventricles. Coefficient of determination (CD) of measured VO2 from predicted VO2 was 0.86 +/- 0.09 (SD) in individual hearts, but decreased to 0.72 when data of the five hearts were pooled. These prospective CDs in individual hearts and all hearts were smaller than retrospective CDs in the individual hearts (0.90 +/- 0.06). Inter-individual variations of A,B, and C caused the lower prospective predictability.", "Mechanical pinning of liquids through inelastic wetting ridge formation on thermally stripped acrylic polymers.\nA film composed of a thermal-stripped, solvent-borne acrylic polymer is shown to completely arrest motion of the three-phase line for water as a result of ridge structure formation. This mechanism produces anomalous wetting behavior including the arbitrary selection of contact angles, formation of quasi-periodic ridge structures on surfaces, and requirement of stick and break motion for wetting line advancement, a novel mechanism reported here. The ridges are retained by the polymer subsequent to wetting, which are 2 scales larger in height than those described previously. This allows for their characterization, which shows significant detail including the hierarchical apex structure where a cutoff area is used in theoretical treatment to avoid a singularity. Results of Wilhelmy plate experiments show a spatial connection between quasi-periodic variation in force-displacement curves and the wetting ridges on plate. These results are consistent with the dominance of the viscoelastic properties of the substrate in determining wetting behavior.", "Everolimus in lung transplantation in Chile.\nEverolimus has shown good results in kidney and heart transplantation, achieving low rates of rejection, of infections, and of tumors compared with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI). Some publications have shown beneficial effects in bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). We have presented herein the initial experience with everolimus among lung allograft recipients in Chile. We retrospectively evaluated, charts of lung-transplanted patients who used everolimus (Certican) based on 2 years' follow-up, evaluating the indication for therapy; blood levels, rejection episodes, lung and kidney function, and side effects. Eight of 55 lung transplantation patients were switched to everolimus, targeting a (mean drug level of 4.2 ng/dL), in combination with low-dose tacrolimus (mean levels 5.5 ng/dL) and steroids. The Reasons for conversion were: CNI nephropathy (n = 3), BOS (n = 4), and lymphoma (n = 1). In patients with renal dysfunction, serum creatinine had risen from 1.1 to 1.8 mg/dl, but at 3 months after everolimus conversion, they had returned to baseline values, maintaining that level for at least 2 years' follow-up. Patients with BOS had decreased their ventricular ejection fraction (VEF(1)) by 50%. Using everolimus, they maintained that VEF(1) with little improvement. The patient with lymphoma died 11 months after conversion. No patient experienced a rejection episode, and they suffered from fewer infections than the other lung allograft recipients. There were no adverse events related to everolimus, but one patient discontinued the drug after 1 year owing to intolerance. Everolimus was effective to reverse CNI renal dysfunction in lung transplantation patients, possibly retarding the progression of BOS, without side effects over a 2-year follow-up.", "Characteristics of dental emergency clinic patients with and without disabilities.\nThis study compared oral health and demographic characteristics of patients with and without disabilities at a dental school emergency clinic. Of 407 consecutive patients surveyed, 20.4% reported disabilities. Two groups matched by age and gender, those with disabilities (DIS, n = 79) and those without disabilities (ND, n = 177), were compared on questionnaire responses; two subgroups, DIS (n = 38) and ND (n = 44), were assessed clinically. The mean ages of the DIS and ND groups were 44.0 years (SD +/- 11.6) and 43.0 years (SD +/- 12.3), respectively. By chi-squared analysis, DIS vs. ND subjects had significantly lower levels of education, employment, income, and dental insurance, and greater dependence on Government funding. In the DIS group, 79.5% were not working, while 6.4% did work regularly. In the ND group, the corresponding values were 30.9% and 46.9%, respectively. In the DIS group, 51.9% identified Medicaid acceptance as the reason they sought care at the clinic, while 62.7% of the subjects in the ND group identified the lower fee structure as the reason for clinic selection. More DIS than ND subjects reported dentists' unavailability and inability to manage the disability, lack of transportation, effect of dental problems on health, and referral by a health professional. DIS vs. ND subjects had significantly fewer sound teeth and more missing teeth. The results suggest that one in five dental school emergency clinic patients has disabilities.", "A comparison of Bacteroides ureolyticus isolates from different clinical sources.\nClinical isolates of corroding, gram-negative, anaerobic bacilli (provisionally identified as Bacteroides ureolyticus) from superficial ulcers and soft tissue infections (15), non-gonococcal, non-chlamydial urethritis (12) and adult periodontal disease (14) were compared with reference strains of B. ureolyticus, B. gracilis and Wolinella recta in a series of conventional tests of morphology, biochemical activity, tolerance of dyes and bile salts, and antibiotic sensitivity, gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of metabolic products, and in whole-cell analysis by pyrolysis-mass spectrometry (Py-MS). A numerical taxonomic approach was used with the results of conventional tests and the grouping obtained was compared with that obtained by Py-MS. All the ulcer and soft-tissue isolates and the urethritis isolates were oxidase- and urease-positive and formed a homogeneous set consistent with the reference strain of B. ureolyticus. The dental isolates differed from B. ureolyticus strains and were heterogeneous amongst themselves. None corresponded with the reference strains of B. gracilis or W. recta. The conventional and Py-MS approaches to characterisation produced similar groupings and each distinguished between a single cluster of ulcer-urethritis strains and several clusters of dental strains, although the dendrograms derived from the two approaches differed in the order of the clusters; in the Py-MS dendrogram one subcluster of four dental strains came within the main ulcer-urethritis cluster and a cluster of five ulcer strains was separated as a distinct group.", "Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis in a peritoneal dialysis patient with prune-belly syndrome: a case report.\nThis case describes a prune-belly syndrome patient who had a kidney transplantation and was diagnosed with Encapsulating Peritoneal Sclerosis (EPS), a rare but potentially fatal condition, mostly associated with Peritoneal Dialysis (PD). The definition of EPS is based on the clinical findings linked to bowel obstruction and on the demonstration of peritoneal thickening. Surgical treatment is the only established basic treatment for the condition. Prune-belly syndrome is characterized by the triad of deficient abdominal musculature, urinary tract abnormality and cryptorchidism. Because it is often associated with end-stage renal disease, PD is essential in the treatment of patients with prune-belly syndrome. The aetiology of EPS follows a 'two-hit theory': the first 'hit' is peritoneal deterioration, caused by long-time exposure to PD. This causes peritoneal disruption which predisposes the patient to a second hit. In our patient, PD discontinuation and renal transplantation are possible 'second hits' that triggered the development of EPS. This case of prune-belly syndrome has all the necessary elements for the development of EPS, and we felt we should report it as the peroperative diagnosis was unexpected.", "Functional Contour-following via Haptic Perception and Reinforcement Learning.\nMany tasks involve the fine manipulation of objects despite limited visual feedback. In such scenarios, tactile and proprioceptive feedback can be leveraged for task completion. We present an approach for real-time haptic perception and decision-making for a haptics-driven, functional contour-following task: the closure of a ziplock bag. This task is challenging for robots because the bag is deformable, transparent, and visually occluded by artificial fingertip sensors that are also compliant. A deep neural net classifier was trained to estimate the state of a zipper within a robot's pinch grasp. A Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (C-MAB) reinforcement learning algorithm was implemented to maximize cumulative rewards by balancing exploration versus exploitation of the state-action space. The C-MAB learner outperformed a benchmark Q-learner by more efficiently exploring the state-action space while learning a hard-to-code task. The learned C-MAB policy was tested with novel ziplock bag scenarios and contours (wire, rope). Importantly, this work contributes to the development of reinforcement learning approaches that account for limited resources such as hardware life and researcher time. As robots are used to perform complex, physically interactive tasks in unstructured or unmodeled environments, it becomes important to develop methods that enable efficient and effective learning with physical testbeds.", "Modulation of antitumoral antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and natural killer activity by Adriamycin and daunorubicin.\nMouse effector cells isolated from various anatomical sources failed to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against alloantiserum-coated L1210 murine leukemia cell targets, whereas rat spleen cells appeared to be potent mediators of this activity. Following suppression of effector cell function 3 days after a single drug injection, the nylon wool non-adherent population of rat spleen cells from daunorubicin (DM)-treated rats demonstrated an increased ability to mediate ADCC compared to controls. Alternatively, although suppression occurred at day 7, no rebound enhancement was demonstrated by the same cell population isolated from Adriamycin (AM)-treated animals for as long as 12 days post-injection. Natural killer (NK) activity, measured as the ability of the nylon wool non-adherent rat spleen cell population to lyse uncoated L1210 cells, was modulated by drug treatment in a similar manner at each time point although the changes were not significant. In contrast to NK cells for which a substantial amount of activity remained adherent to nylon wool, all K cell activity was found in the non-adherent spleen cell population. The effector cell, in both cases, was not susceptible to antithymocyte serum plus complement treatment; however, NK activity appeared trypsin-sensitive whereas K cell activity did not. Therefore, AM and DM demonstrated different activities with regard to in vivo modulation of antitumoral ADCC.", "Gas pressure assisted microliquid-liquid extraction coupled online to direct infusion mass spectrometry: a new automated screening platform for bioanalysis.\nIn the field of bioanalysis, there is an increasing demand for miniaturized, automated, robust sample pretreatment procedures that can be easily connected to direct-infusion mass spectrometry (DI-MS) in order to allow the high-throughput screening of drugs and/or their metabolites in complex body fluids like plasma. Liquid-Liquid extraction (LLE) is a common sample pretreatment technique often used for complex aqueous samples in bioanalysis. Despite significant developments that have been made in automated and miniaturized LLE procedures, fully automated LLE techniques allowing high-throughput bioanalytical studies on small-volume samples using direct infusion mass spectrometry, have not been matured yet. Here, we introduce a new fully automated micro-LLE technique based on gas-pressure assisted mixing followed by passive phase separation, coupled online to nanoelectrospray-DI-MS. Our method was characterized by varying the gas flow and its duration through the solvent mixture. For evaluation of the analytical performance, four drugs were spiked to human plasma, resulting in highly acceptable precision (RSD down to 9%) and linearity (R(2) ranging from 0.990 to 0.998). We demonstrate that our new method does not only allow the reliable extraction of analytes from small sample volumes of a few microliters in an automated and high-throughput manner, but also performs comparable or better than conventional offline LLE, in which the handling of small volumes remains challenging. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our method for drug screening on dried blood spots showing excellent linearity (R(2) of 0.998) and precision (RSD of 9%). In conclusion, we present the proof of principe of a new high-throughput screening platform for bioanalysis based on a new automated microLLE method, coupled online to a commercially available nano-ESI-DI-MS.", "Endoscopic evaluation of patients with dyspepsia: results from the national endoscopic data repository.\nEndoscopy is commonly performed to evaluate symptoms of dyspepsia. The aim of this study was to characterize patients who receive endoscopy for dyspepsia and measure predictors of primary endoscopic outcomes, utilizing a large national endoscopic database. The Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative (CORI) receives endoscopy reports from a network of 74 sites in the United States. Sixty-one percent of reports come from private practice settings. Patients with reflux dyspepsia and nonreflux dyspepsia were identified from January 2000 to June 2002. Patients with dysphagia and known Barrett's esophagus were excluded. Primary endoscopic outcomes included esophageal inflammation and stricture, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, suspected Barrett's esophagus (> or =2 cm), and suspected esophageal and gastric malignancy. The presence or absence of alarm symptoms (vomiting, weight loss, and evidence of GI blood loss) was determined. Adjusted relative risk (RR) for predicting serious outcomes was calculated in a multivariate model. We received 117,497 endoscopic reports, representing 99,558 unique patients. Dyspepsia, with and without reflux symptoms, accounted for 43% of upper endoscopies. Among dyspeptic patients, 36.5% were younger than 50 years of age without alarm symptoms. Esophageal or gastric malignancy in patients with dyspepsia was associated with increasing age, male sex, Asian race, Native American race, and symptoms of weight loss and vomiting. Suspected Barrett's esophagus (> or =2 cm) was associated with reflux symptoms, male sex, age, and white race. Ulcers were associated with evidence of bleeding, vomiting, male sex, black race, and Hispanic ethnicity. These practice-based data reveal important practice behaviors and outcomes.", "Reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the short form of the Dentine Hypersensitivity Experience Questionnaire (DHEQ-15).\nThe aim of this study was to validate the short form of the Dentine Hypersensitivity Experience Questionnaire (DHEQ-15) in Chinese patients with dentine hypersensitivity (DH). In total, 200 patients with DH were recruited to complete the questionnaire. The reliability of the DHEQ-15 was evaluated using internal consistency and test-retest methods. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to identify domains of the DHEQ-15. Convergent validity was determined by analyzing the correlation between DHEQ-15 subscale scores and the global rating of oral health question. Cronbach's alpha value (internal reliability) for the total DHEQ-15 score was 0.934 (higher to the original DHEQ-15' 0.924), and the intraclass correlation coefficient value (test-retest reliability) was 0.894 (lower to the original DHEQ-15' 0.939). The EFA identified three components with eigenvalues >1, explaining 53.0, 17.1, and 12.3% of the variance, respectively, accounting for a total of 82.4% of the variance. The three components named 'restrictions' (three items), 'changes in eating habits' (six items), and 'emotions and identity' (six items). In terms of convergent validity, the DHEQ-15 subscale was significant highly negatively correlated to the global oral health rating. The results provide initial evidence that the DHEQ-15 can be properly used for assessment of patients with DH in China.", "[Pseudo-mesotheliomatous adenocarcinoma of the lung].\nBoth pathologists and clinicians are challenged by the diagnosis of a particular variant of the peripheral adenocarcinoma with involvement of the pleura parietalis, the so-called pseudo-mesotheliomatous adenocarcinoma of the lung (PMAC), which is hard to differentiate from epithelioid mesothelioma on imaging and cytology, macroscopically as well as histologically. However, the exact diagnosis is not only crucial for the patient's therapy but also for insurance matters. Immunohistochemical evaluation represents a quick and a relatively cheap tool for which a few antibody panels have been proposed in recent years as being suitable to distinguish between these two entities. One of the positive markers for epithelioid mesothelioma most often suggested seems to be calretinin. We would like to report on a case of PMAC with the special feature of positive calretinin immunohistochemical staining. Using histochemistry and a few additional antibodies we were able to reliably characterize the tumor and provide the patient with appropriate therapy. This article gives a short overview of the possibilities available for distinguishing between these two entities in the context of a case report.", "TNK cells (NKG2D+ CD8+ or CD4+ T lymphocytes) in the control of human tumors.\nInnate and adaptive immune responses have many interactions that are regulated by the balance of signals initiated by a variety of activatory and inhibitory receptors. Among these, the NKG2D molecule was identified as expressed by T lymphocytes, including most CD8+ cells and a minority of CD4+ cells, designated TNK cells in this paper. Tumor cells may overexpress the stress-inducible NKG2D ligands (NKG2DLs: MICA/B, ULBPs) and the NKG2D signaling has been shown to be involved in lymphocyte-mediated anti-tumor activity. Aberrant expression of NKG2DLs by cancer cells, such as the release of soluble form of NKG2DLs, can lead to the impairment of these immune responses. Here, we discuss the significance of NKG2D in TNK-mediated anti-tumor activity. Our studies demonstrate that NKG2D+ T cells (TNK) are commonly recruited at the tumor site in melanoma patients where they may exert anti-tumor activity by engaging both TCR and NKG2D. Moreover, NKG2D and TCR triggering was also observed by peripheral blood derived T lymphocyte- or T cell clone-mediated tumor recognition, both in melanoma and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Notably, heterogeneous expression of NKG2DLs was found in melanoma and CRC cells, with a decrease of these molecules along with tumor progression. Therefore, through the mechanisms that govern NKG2D engagement in anti-tumor activity and the expression of NKG2DLs by tumor cells that still need to be dissected, we showed that NKG2D expressing TNK cells are a relevant T cell subtype for immunosurveillance of tumors and we propose that new immunotherapeutic interventions for cancer patients should be aimed also at enhancing NKG2DLs expression by tumor cells.", "Engagement of the elderly in time banking: the potential for social capital generation in an aging society.\nCommunity currency systems attempt to empower the economically marginalized and build social capital. This research explores the role of the elderly in a local voluntary organization. The elderly are potentially very important contributors, yet we know little about their participation in these local exchange networks. Eighty-seven months' worth of transaction data from a \"time bank,\" which has had a total of 950 members, was examined in social network analyses. Measures of quantitative engagement in the system were constructed. The elderly were found to be as active as other members. Qualitative characteristics of the network were also explored. The organization is rather homogeneous, yet exchanges within it tend to connect diverse actors. Male and female seniors undertransact with themselves and with one another, generating bridging social capital. The evidence presented suggests that the participation of the elderly in local currencies is mutually beneficial.", "Selective venous sampling for ACTH in Cushing's syndrome: differentiation between Cushing disease and the ectopic ACTH syndrome.\nWe performed selective venous catheterization and sampling for ACTH in six patients with ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas (Cushing's disease) and four patients with occult ectopic ACTH-secreting neoplasms. In five patients with Cushing's disease in whom the inferior petrosal sinus could be catheterized, ACTH levels were unequivocally higher than simultaneous peripheral values: The ratio was greater than 2.0, with a range of 2.2 to 16.7. In contrast, the inferior petrosal sinus-to-peripheral ACTH ratio in three patients with ectopic ACTH secretion was less than 1.5. In the fourth patient, an arteriovenous gradient of 6.8 was shown 2 years before a bronchial carcinoid tumor was clinically apparent. Central-to-peripheral ACTH ratios at the level of the jugular bulb and jugular vein were not diagnostic. We conclude that selective venous ACTH sampling from the inferior petrosal sinus is a reliable and useful aid in the differential diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome when standard clinical and biochemical studies are inconclusive.", "High-throughput analysis pipeline for achieving simple low-copy wheat and barley transgenics.\nTransgenic (or genetically modified-GM) plant breeding is increasingly being used as a supplementary tool to many classical plant-breeding programs. Currently the range of transgenic traits accepted for commercial use is largely restricted to herbicide and pest resistance. Given the fact that transgenics can offer an alternative and novel source of genetic variation, pre-breeding research is now increasingly exploiting this technology to tackle a greater spectrum of traits. These traits range from abiotic stress tolerance to improved product quality and nutritional characteristics. Likewise there is an increasing demand for high-throughput methodologies for transgenic plant generation, characterization and phenotyping. Selecting simple low-copy number transgenic events that are both heritable and stably expressed \"in planta\" is considered a prerequisite to systematic phenotyping for traits of interest. Furthermore, this assessment relies heavily on comparisons to appropriate control plants, in the case of wheat and barley transgenics this is both wild-type and null siblings. This chapter presents a general scheme on which to base selection of transgenics and respective null siblings using wheat and barley as an example. This scheme can be adapted to other similar crop species. Overall this strategy reduces the total number of plants to be genotyped and phenotyped at each generational step, and therefore resulting in significant savings in time, effort, and resources.", "Pancreatic acinar cell necrosis with intact storage of digestive enzymes in selenomethionine treated rats.\nMorphological and biochemical changes were observed in the pancreas and serum of rats after the intraperitoneal administration of selenomethionine, sodium selenite and methionine. Selenomethionine caused rapidly developing acinar cell necrosis. The first pathological changes were mitochondrial swelling and flocculent densities, and dilatation of cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. Zymogen granules appeared disrupted only in disintegrated acinar cells. Signs of autodigestive pancreatic inflammation with fat necrosis, elevation of pancreatic phospholipase A2 and serum amylase activities, as well as pulmonary oedema were present. Sodium selenite caused similar histologic changes to those produced by selenomethionine, but no changes were seen after methionine administration. Destruction of pancreatic acinar cells by an intraductal oleic acid injection that resulted in exocrine atrophy did not prevent systemic selenomethionine toxicity. Our results show that selenomethionine causes pancreatic acinar cell necrosis and that intracellular transport and storage of digestive enzymes is not primarily altered by this chemical.", "Three-dimensional potential energy surface of selected carbohydrates' CH/\u03c0 dispersion interactions calculated by high-level quantum mechanical methods.\nIn this study we present the first systematic computational three-dimensional scan of carbohydrate hydrophobic patches for the ability to interact through CH/\u03c0 dispersion interactions. The carbohydrates \u03b2-d-glucopyranose, \u03b2-d-mannopyranose and \u03b1-l-fucopyranose were studied in a complex with a benzene molecule, which served as a model of the CH/\u03c0 interaction in carbohydrate/protein complexes. The 3D relaxed scans were performed at the SCC-DFTB-D level with 3 757 grid points for both carbohydrate hydrophobic sides. The interaction energy of all grid points was recalculated at the DFT-D BP/def2-TZVPP level. The results obtained clearly show highly delimited and separated areas around each CH group, with an interaction energy up to -5.40 kcal mol(-1) . The results also show that with increasing H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 distance these delimited areas merge and form one larger region, which covers all hydrogen atoms on that specific carbohydrate side. Simultaneously, the interaction becomes weaker with an energy of -2.5 kcal mol(-1) . All local energy minima were optimized at the DFT-D BP/def2-TZVPP level and the interaction energies of these complexes were refined by use of the high-level ab initio computation at the CCSD(T)/CBS level. Results obtained from the optimization suggest that the CH group hydrogen atoms are not equivalent and the interaction energy at the CCSD(T)/CBS level range from -3.54 to -5.40 kcal mol(-1) . These results also reveal that the optimal H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u03c0 distance for the CH/\u03c0 dispersion interaction is approximately (2.310\u00b10.030) \u00c5, and the angle defined as carbon-hydrogen-benzene geometrical centre is (180\u00b130)\u00b0. These results reveal that whereas the dispersion interactions with the lowest interaction energies are quite strictly located in space, the slightly higher interaction energy regions adopt a much larger space.", "Elevations in serum alpha-fetoprotein levels in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\nIn a retrospective analysis of 166 patients with chronic hepatitis B followed for up to 8 years, 22 patients had 29 episodes of elevations in serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. Twenty-five episodes were due to a transient exacerbation of the underlying hepatitis and 11 of these episodes were followed by a loss of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) from serum and a remission in disease. Two patients were found to have hepatocellular carcinoma. No apparent cause could be found in a further two episodes of AFP elevation. In comparison to 144 patients with normal levels, the 22 with AFP elevations were more likely to have cirrhosis (61% versus 13%, P = 0.01), to die a liver-related death (27% versus 0.7%, P = 0.0007) and to have hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (9% versus 0%, P = 0.002). These findings confirm that AFP can be used to screen for HCC in high-risk patients with chronic hepatitis B. The majority of AFP elevations, however, will be found to be due to exacerbations of disease, with or without loss of HBeAg from serum, especially in white patients with severe disease and cirrhosis.", "Development of a model meat system and investigation of the growth characteristics and genetic stability of Escherichia coli O157:H7, in the absence of meat microflora.\nModel meat systems were produced using both aseptically procured and irradiated raw minced beef to initially compare the growth characteristics of a three-strain mixture of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in each medium. A multiplex PCR assay (detecting VT1, VT2 and eae genes) was used to determine the proportion of individual strains recovered at each sampling time by virtue of the different combinations of these virulence factors encoded by each strain, and to investigate their genetic stability. No differences in the growth characteristics of the pathogen (P>0.05) were recorded in the meat matrices, irrespective of the preparation method, thus validating the use of irradiation to sterilise (42 kGy, in vacuo at <-5 degrees C) minced meat in the production of control meat matrices for application to further research investigations. A novel plating method, incorporating a period of catalase-induced resuscitation, was found to give significantly higher recovery of the pathogen (P<0.05) from these meat matrices when compared to conventional spread-plating on Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA). A proportion of the recovered populations, however, was found to be failing to produce an amplicon relating to a Verotoxin (VT) gene. A further investigation demonstrated that O157:H7 strain E 90197 (VT2 and eae positive) was displaying genetic instability during growth in and recovery from meat matrices with the apparent loss of the VT2 gene. An alternative VT2 and eae positive strain (ATCC 43889) demonstrated no such genetic instability, demonstrating inter-strain variation for this phenomenon. Thus, it should be considered that an essential pre-requisite to studies relying upon the maintenance of the pathogenic potential of E. coli O157:H7 should be an evaluation of the genetic stability of proposed strains of this serotype.", "Angiotensin II sensitivity in nonpregnant formerly preeclamptic women and healthy parous controls.\nIn women prone to develop hypertensive complications, vascular reactivity fails to decrease in early pregnancy. Since hypertensive syndromes of pregnancy seem to be superimposed on a preexisting disorder, we tested the hypothesis that in formerly preeclamptic women, as compared to healthy parous controls, circulatory reactivity to angiotensin II is enhanced in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Sixty formerly preeclamptic women were subdivided into a hypertensive (HYPERT, n = 14), a normotensive thrombophilic (THROMB, n = 26), and a normotensive nonthrombophilic (ASYMPT, n = 20) subgroup. In these women and in 11 healthy parous controls we assessed at least 5 months postpartum at day 5 (+/-2) of the menstrual cycle the following variables: body weight, height, plasma volume, reactivity to infused angiotensin II of arterial blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal blood flow, and the hormones of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) axis. At baseline, THROMB did not differ from controls. In contrast, ASYMPT exhibited slight overweight, reduced plasma volume, and reduced renal blood flow. HYPERT much resembled ASYMPT except for the overweight, renal perfusion, and GFR. Infusion of angiotensin II led to comparable decreases in renal perfusion and filtration, and to increases in blood pressure. However, sensitivity to this substance correlated inversely with relative and absolute sizes of the plasma volume compartment. Circulatory sensitivity to infused angiotensin II is comparable between nonpregnant formerly preeclamptic women and healthy parous controls. However, responsiveness to this agent is enhanced among women with a contracted plasma volume compartment, a condition commonly observed among formerly preeclamptic women.", "Effects of neurokinins on the isolated pig coronary artery.\nThe actions of substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), neurokinin B (NKB), physalaemin (PHY), kassinin (KAS) and eledoisin (ELE) were investigated on transversally cut strips of pig coronary artery. All tachykinins produced vasodilatation of coronary arteries precontracted with ACh; 10(-5) M. The order of potency was: SP = PHY ELE greater than KAS greater than NKA greater than NKB, with the ED50 values being 0.38, 0.38, 1.2, 2.6, 8.3 and 34.0 nM, respectively. Continued superfusion of SP (7.4 X 10(-9) M) desensitized the coronary arteries which were refractory to the vasodilator action of NKA, NKB, PHY and KAS. The arteries nevertheless dilated upon the addition of noradrenaline (NA) and bradykinin (BK). Endothelium-removed preparations did not respond to any of the tachykinins. However, tissues devoid of endothelium relaxed in response to both NA and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Three octapeptide antagonists, [D-Pro4,Ala6,D-Trp7,9,Nle11]SP-(4-11) (compound I), [D-Pro4,Ser6,D-Trp7,9,Nle11]SP-(4-11) (compound II) and [D-Pro4,D-Trp7,9,10,Phe11]SP-(4-11) (compound III) were examined as potential antagonists of tachykinin-induced vasodilatation. Compounds I and II blocked the actions of SP and NKA but not that of PHY. Compound III effectively blocked the actions of SP and PHY. We conclude that the pig coronary artery possesses a 'NK-P/SP-P' type receptor, and that this receptor is probably localized on the endothelium.", "Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate accumulation in Nostoc muscorum and Spirulina platensis under phosphate limitation.\nNostoc muscorum and Spirulina platensis were grown under phosphate deficiency in order to investigate the role of internal phosphate pool and activity of alkaline phosphatase on poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) accumulation. PHB accumulation in N. muscorum increased to 22.7% of dry weight (dw) after 4 day of phosphate deficiency, while the internal phosphate pool reduced to the level of 0.02 microM mg dw(-1) at a maximum APase activity of 2.57nM PNP mg dw(-1) h(-1). In contrary, S. platensis depicted maxima of 1.39nM PNP mg dw(-1) h(-1) on day 30 of incubation, which was about 2 fold lower than the observed value of N. muscorum. PHB content in S. platensis remained low even after prolonged phosphate starvation, and a rise only up to 3.5% of dw was recorded on day 60 of phosphate deficiency. Supplementation of NADPH exogenously to S. platensis cultures grown under phosphate deficiency favoured PHB accumulation in 10, 20 and 30 days old cultures, but not in the cultures grown under phosphate deficiency for 60 days. The possible role of phosphate limitation on PHB accumulation is discussed.", "Birth weight, current body mass index, and insulin sensitivity and secretion in young adults in two Latin American populations.\nAlthough studies have shown association of birth weight (BW) and adult body mass index (BMI) with insulin sensitivity in adults, there is limited evidence that BW is associated with insulin secretion. We assessed the associations between BW and current BMI with insulin sensitivity and secretion in young Latin American adults. Two birth cohorts, one from Ribeirao Preto, Brazil, based on 1984 participants aged 23-25 years, and another from Limache, Chile, based on 965 participants aged 22-28 years were studied. Weight and height at birth, and current fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels were measured. Insulin sensitivity (HOMA%S) and secretion (HOMA%\u03b2) were estimated using the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA2). Multiple linear regression analyses were carried out to test the associations between BW and adult BMI z-scores on log HOMA%S and log HOMA%\u03b2. BW z-score was associated with HOMA%S in the two populations and HOMA%\u03b2 in Ribeirao Preto when adult BMI z-score was included in the model. BW z-score was associated with decreasing insulin secretion even without adjusting for adult BMI, but only in Ribeirao Preto. BMI z-score was associated with low HOMA%S and high HOMA%\u03b2. No interactions between BW and BMI z-scores on insulin sensitivity were shown. This study supports the finding that BW may affect insulin sensitivity and secretion in young adults. The effect size of BW on insulin status is small in comparison to current BMI.", "Mortality and the acquisition of basic skills by children and adults with severe disabilities.\nTo determine normative data on age-related probabilities of children with severe disabilities acquiring mobility or self-feeding skills, or dying during a 5-year follow-up period. A 5-year follow-up study of three mutually exclusive subgroups formed on the basis of severe, profound, or suspected levels of retardation and incontinence and the following combinations of feeding and mobility skills. The sample was made up of 7836 children and adults distributed among the three subgroups being served in California between January 1981 and December 1985. Subjects who were tube-fed and immobile showed very little likelihood of becoming mobile or feeding themselves and had a high probability of death. Individuals who had some mobility experienced a better outcome. After age 6 years, the most probable outcome for children who are immobile and cannot feed themselves is death or no improvement in self-help skills.", "A semi-automatic method for quantification and classification of erythrocytes infected with malaria parasites in microscopic images.\nVisual quantification of parasitemia in thin blood films is a very tedious, subjective and time-consuming task. This study presents an original method for quantification and classification of erythrocytes in stained thin blood films infected with Plasmodium falciparum. The proposed approach is composed of three main phases: a preprocessing step, which corrects luminance differences. A segmentation step that uses the normalized RGB color space for classifying pixels either as erythrocyte or background followed by an Inclusion-Tree representation that structures the pixel information into objects, from which erythrocytes are found. Finally, a two step classification process identifies infected erythrocytes and differentiates the infection stage, using a trained bank of classifiers. Additionally, user intervention is allowed when the approach cannot make a proper decision. Four hundred fifty malaria images were used for training and evaluating the method. Automatic identification of infected erythrocytes showed a specificity of 99.7% and a sensitivity of 94%. The infection stage was determined with an average sensitivity of 78.8% and average specificity of 91.2%.", "Role of voltage-gated K(+) channels in regulating Ca(2+) entry in rat cortical astrocytes.\nAstrocytes have multiple functions such as provision of nourishment and mechanical support to the nervous system, helping to clear extracellular metabolites of neurons and modulating synaptic transmission by releasing gliotransmitters. In excitable cells, voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channels serve to repolarize during action potentials. Astrocytes are considered non-excitable cells since they are not able to generate action potentials. There is an abundant expression of various Kv channels in astrocytes but the functions of these Kv channels remain unclear. We examined whether these astrocyte Kv channels regulate astrocyte \"excitability\" in the form of cytosolic Ca(2+) signaling. Electrophysiological examination revealed that neonatal rat cortical astrocytes possessed both delayed rectifier type and A-type Kv channels. Pharmacological blockade of both delayed rectifier Kv channels by TEA and A-type Kv channels by quinidine significantly suppressed store-operated Ca(2+) influx; however, TEA alone or quinidine alone did not suffice to cause such suppression. TEA and quinidine together dramatically enhanced current injection-triggered membrane potential overshoot (depolarization); either drug alone caused much smaller enhancements. Taken together, the results suggest both delayed rectifier and A-type Kv channels regulate astrocyte Ca(2+) signaling via controlling membrane potential.", "One of the known post-translation modifications of proteins is the oxidation of methionine residues to methionine sulfoxide [Met (O)]. An enzyme, peptide-methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrA), which has been detected in virtually all organisms examined, catalyzes the reduction of free and protein-bound methionine sulfoxide residues to methionine. By its function, the enzyme can repair, to some extent, proteins damaged by reactive oxygen species (ROS). We have created a \"knock-out\" mouse lacking the MsrA protein by disruption of the second exon of the msrA gene in which the putative active site resides. The homozygote mice (MT) are viable and do not show an obvious phenotype in comparison to the wild-type (WT) parent mice. However, tissue levels of oxidized proteins in MTs are higher than in WTs and the MTs are more sensitive to killing by 100% oxygen than the WTs, suggesting that the loss of MsrA increased the sensitivity to oxidative stress. Moreover, we have identified a compensatory system for the lack of MsrA activity, which is induced in the MT animals, and characterized its function in various tissues. The fact that such a system exists manifests the importance of the MsrA function. Further experiments are planned to investigate the role of the msrA gene and the alternative back-up system in aging using the MT mice as a study model. So far the oldest animals are only around 12 months old. It is expected with further aging that differences in the viability between the two strains of mice will become more pronounced.", "Tussometry: an objective assessment of vocal cord function.\nA number of techniques have recently been developed for altering laryngeal function, including structural framework surgery, reinnervation procedures, augmentation of the vocal cords, electrical stimulation, and pharmacologic intervention. The application of such procedures to appropriate disorders would be facilitated by better objective measures of the outcome. This study describes the new technique of tussometry, which investigates the airflow pattern produced during coughing. The value of 1 parameter, peak value time, is shown by a study of 35 vocal cord palsies versus a control, and of 17 vocal cord palsies before and after augmentation, to be an accurate assessment of vocal cord position. The technique is independent of lung function parameters and intraoral pressures. It is truly objective, having an interobserver variation of 0%, and is eminently reproducible, with an intrasubject coefficient of variation of 3.1% to 5.7%. Tussometry is a rapid, noninvasive technique providing inexpensive objective assessment of vocal cord function in the office setting.", "Patterns of tumor spread and risk of fracture and epidural impingement in metastatic vertebrae.\nAmong patients with vertebral metastases, the identification of candidates for surgical stabilization has a limited basis in evidence. We retrospectively studied patterns of tumor spread (n = 756 vertebrae) and predictors of fracture and epidural impingement (n = 113 vertebrae) in infiltrated vertebrae with varying tumor histologies using sequential magnetic resonance images. Vertebral bodies were divided into 16 cells to map lesions. Fractured vertebrae were classified based on histology, level, fracture pattern, prefracture infiltration, and epidural impingement. Lesions were most often located within upper lumbar levels and the medial vertebral body. Fracture risk was greatest for upper lumbar (RR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.12, 3.38) and undifferentiated tumors (RR = 7.36; 95% CI: 2.69, 20.12). A fourfold increase in fracture risk was noted in vertebrae with >80% body infiltration (HR = 4.5966; 95% CI: 1.66, 12.71). Symmetric fractures with fragments had the greatest risk of epidural impingement (p = 0.002). These findings have implications for management of patients with vertebral metastases.", "Effects of hemodialysis on sleep apnea syndrome in end-stage renal disease.\nA high prevalence of sleep apnea syndrome has been reported in previous studies of patients with chronic renal failure. The possible effects of chronic hemodialysis on the magnitude and severity of sleep apnea have not yet been clarified. The present study was undertaken to understand this relationship, by examining subjective and objective measures of sleep on nights following hemodialysis compared to those without hemodialysis. Significant sleep apnea was noted in 6 of 11 patients. The percentage of apnea time comprised of obstructive apneas increased significantly on the nights following hemodialysis. No significant differences occurred between these nights in the subjective or EEG measures of sleep, or in the total number of disordered breathing events or level of arterial oxygen desaturation. The association between end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and sleep apnea syndrome remains highly significant, but seems not to be acutely altered by conventional hemodialysis treatment.", "Cardiovascular risk factors for early carotid atherosclerosis in the general population: the Edinburgh Artery Study.\nRecent attempts to identify cardiovascular risk factors affecting early-stage carotid atherosclerosis, measured by ultrasonographically assessed intima-media thickness, have been inconclusive. To study the relationship between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and intima-media thickness. Ultrasonic evaluation of the intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery was included in the 5-year follow-up examination of participants of the Edinburgh Artery Study. We had valid readings of intima-media thickness for 1106 men and women aged 60-80 years. Information on a range of cardiovascular risk factors had been collected during the baseline examination. For men, in addition to age, lifetime smoking (measured in terms of pack years) was the only cardiovascular risk factor associated with increased intima-media thickness (P< or = 0.01) in the univariate analysis. Both systolic blood pressure (P < or = 0.001) and the high-density lipoprotein (HDL: total cholesterol ratio (P < or = 0.01) were correlated with intima-media thickness for women. When all the variables had been included in a multivariate analysis, pack years of smoking and the HDL:total cholesterol ratio were associated with early atherosclerotic development in men. In an equivalent analysis for women, alcohol consumption, systolic blood pressure and the HDL:total cholesterol ratio were associated with intima-media thickness. These data suggest that risk factors affecting intima-media thickness differ for men and women. Further sex-specific analyses of prospective population studies are required in order to clarify the role of 'traditional' cardiovascular risk factors in the early stages of carotid atherosclerosis.", "Lack of impact of dietary inclusion of dried Artemisia annua leaves for cattle on infestation by Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus ticks.\nThe present study evaluated whether a natural dietary additive, dried Artemisia annua leaves, may be useful to control Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus on naturally infested cattle. Twenty heifers of the Canchim breed, weighing around 250 kg, were divided into two equally sized experimental groups: 1) control animals and 2) animals receiving 200 g/day of dried A. annua leaves for two months. Before treatment began, the animals were homogeneously distributed in control and treatment groups based on their pre-treatment weight and tick infestation level. Counts of engorged female ticks then occurred weekly during the two-month experimental period. We also monitored cattle weight gain and packed cell volume (PCV). Artemisinin (0.96%) was quantified in the plant material by high-performance liquid chromatography with refractive index detector (HPLC-IR). No statistical differences between the control and treatment groups were observed for engorged female counts (log averages of 1.3 ticks and 1.4 ticks per animal, respectively), daily cattle weight gain (0.910 kg and 0.888 kg, respectively) or PCV (33.5% and 33.0%, respectively). We conclude that the oral supplementation of cattle feed with dried A. annuna leaves did not control natural infestation of R. (B.) microplus. The hypothesis of artemisinin's action on cattle ticks by ingestion through the animals' blood was not confirmed at the evaluated dose.", "tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6695861113484999360.post4100070219868427406..comments2017-08-17T18:10:38.507+01:00Comments on Craft-E-Place: Wet Saturday ...Craft-E-Placehttp://www.blogger.com/profile/02736498743959369943noreply@blogger.comBlogger11125tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6695861113484999360.post-67759516484455700612017-08-16T02:17:10.699+01:002017-08-16T02:17:10.699+01:00This is absolutely gorgeous.

Mitochondria are 'dynamic' in that they are constantly undergoing fission and fusion to remain in a functional state throughout the cell cycle, as well as during other vital processes such as energy supply, cellular respiration and programmed cell death. The mitochondrial fission/fusion machinery is involved in generating young mitochondria, while eliminating old, damaged and non-repairable ones. As a result, the organelles change in shape, size and number throughout the cell cycle. Such precise and accurate balance is maintained by the cytoskeletal transporting system via microtubules, which deliver the mitochondrion from one location to another. During the gap phases G1 and G2, mitochondria form an interconnected network, whereas in mitosis and S-phase fragmentation of the mitochondrial network will take place. However, such balance is lost during neoplastic transformation and autoimmune disorders. Several proteins, such as Drp1, Fis1, Kif-family proteins, Opa1, Bax and mitofusins change in activity and might link the mitochondrial fission/fusion events with processes such as alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptosis, necrosis, cell cycle arrest, and malignant growth. All this indicates how vital proper functioning of mitochondria is in maintaining cell integrity and preventing carcinogenesis.", "Endoscopic screening and surveillance for Barrett's esophagus--clinical implications.\nThere is now a clear causal relationship between symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal adenocarcinoma (Lagergren et al, 1999). The risk factor is now identified as Barrett's metaplasia (Solaymani et al, 2004). Chronic reflux results in Barrett's metaplastic change, and the route to carcinoma is a stepwise progression, through dysplasia to invasive carcinoma (Jankowski et al, 2000). Earlier-stage disease is found in patients undergoing surveillance and is the major predictor of survival following surgery (Fountoulakis et al, 2004). Screening and surveillance by endoscopic biopsy regimen has profound implications for the allocation of healthcare resources and the provision of clinical services. Screening a high-risk group such as men with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) will result in the detection of more patients with Barrett's esophagus, many of whom are asymptomatic. Once detected, questions remain as to surveillance intervals and the current methodology for surveillance. There are profound challenges with the accurate endoscopic and pathologic detection and categorization of Barrett's metaplasia, dysplasia , and, indeed, cancer. New endoscopic detection methods are being investigated to improve the diagnosis and definition of the premalignant phenotype. The detection of dysplasia requires increased surveillance and usually intervention either endoscopically or with surgery.", "[Peptide phage display in biotechnology and biomedicine].\nTo date peptide phage display is one of the most common combinatorial methods used for identifying specific peptide ligands. Phage display peptide libraries containing billions different clones successfully used for selection of ligands with high affinity and selectivity toward wide range of targets including individual proteins, bacteria, viruses, spores, different kind of cancer cells and variety of nonorganic targets (metals, alloys, semiconductors etc.) Success of using filamentous phage in phage display technologies relays on the robustness of phage particles and a possibility to genetically modify its DNA to construct new phage variants with novel properties. In this review we are discussing characteristics of the most known non-commercial peptide phage display libraries of different formats (landscape libraries in particular) and their successful applications in several fields of biotechnology and biomedicine: discovery of peptides with diagnostic values against different pathogens, discovery and using of peptides recognizing cancer cells, trends in using of phage display technologies in human interactome studies, application of phage display technologies in construction of novel nano materials.", "Estimates of the incidence and prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases in the United States. American Social Health Association Panel.\nAccurate, updated estimates of the incidence and prevalence of sexually transmitted infections in the United States remain elusive. The most widely quoted number of new sexually transmitted disease (STD) cases each year is 12 million. However, this figure has not changed in more than a decade, despite improvements in detection methods and the effects of STD control programs. To propose a system for weighing the strength of STD surveillance data and to estimate the incidence and prevalence of STDs in the United States for 1996, using the available published data. We estimate that more than 15 million STD infections occurred in the United States in 1996. This number exceeds the earlier estimate primarily because improved detection techniques have allowed an assessment of previously undiagnosed infections. Large numbers of new STDs continue to occur each year in the United States, with serious health and economic consequences. More than two thirds of our current estimate of 15 million STDs annually consists of two infections--trichomoniasis and human papillomavirus--for which we have only level III surveillance data. As the quality of our surveillance data improves, we can further refine the precision of our national estimates.", "Virus-driven autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation: the example of HCV infection.\nHCV chronic infection is characterized by possible development of both hepatic and extrahepatic manifestations. The infection by this both hepatotropic and lymphotropic virus is responsible for polyoligoclonal B-lymphocyte expansion, leading to several immune-mediated disorders. Mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome that in some cases may evolve to frank B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the prototype of HCV-driven autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders. The HCV oncogenic potential has been suggested by several clinicoepidemiological and laboratory studies; it includes hepatocellular carcinoma, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and papillary thyroid cancer. The definition HCV syndrome refers to the complex of HCV-driven diseases; these latter are characterized by heterogeneous geographical distribution, suggesting a role of other important genetic and/or environmental cofactors. The natural history of HCV syndrome is the result of a multifactorial and multistep pathogenetic process, which may evolve from mild manifestations to systemic autoimmune disorders, and less frequently to malignant neoplasias. The present updated review analyzes the clinical and pathogenetic aspects of the main HCV-associated diseases.", "Physicians' guideline adherence is associated with better prognosis in outpatients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: the QUALIFY international registry.\nTo evaluate the impact of physicians' adherence to guideline-recommended medications for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), including \u226550% prescription of recommended doses, on clinical outcomes at 6-month follow-up. In QUALIFY, an international, prospective, observational, longitudinal survey, 6669 outpatients with HFrEF were recruited 1-15 months after heart failure (HF) hospitalization from September 2013 to December 2014 in 36 countries and followed up at 6 months. A global adherence to guidelines score was developed for prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers (BBs), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and ivabradine and their dosages. Baseline global adherence score was good in 23% of patients, moderate in 55%, and poor in 22%. At 6-month follow-up, poor adherence was associated with significantly higher overall mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 2.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-3.44, P=0.001], cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.36-3.77, P=0.003), HF mortality (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.21-4.2, P=0.032), combined HF hospitalization or HF death (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08-1.71, P=0.024) and cardiovascular hospitalization or cardiovascular death (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.69, P=0.013). There was a strong trend between poor adherence and HF hospitalization (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.68, P=0.069). Good adherence to pharmacologic treatment guidelines for ACEIs, ARBs, BBs, MRAs and ivabradine, with prescription of at least 50% of recommended dosages, was associated with better clinical outcomes during 6-month follow-up. Continuing global educational initiatives are needed to emphasise the importance of guideline recommendations for optimising drug therapy and prescribing evidence-based doses in clinical practice.", "The objective of this work is to study the role of thyroid hormone binding proteins in mediating the toxic effects of certain halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons of environmental importance. Current interest is in the binding proteins specific for thyroxine (T4). Prealbumin (TBPA) is a major thyroxine binding protein in blood which has been proposed as a model for the thyroxine nuclear receptor in tissue. Molecular interactions of TBPA with the dioxins, furans and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been studied with use of computer graphics and predictions made regarding relative binding affinities for such structures. These modeling predictions were tested by experimentally measuring the binding affinities of soluble derivatives of those structures, and the results are in good agreement with prediction. The binding model can account for the requirements for lateral halogens and for a linear and symmetrical molecular shape in toxicity. Similar results were obtained in studies investigating the inhibitory potency of outer (phenolic) ring deiodination of reverse triiodothyronine (r-T3 5'-deiodinase) in microsomal fractions of rat liver in vitro for which TBPA served as an active site model. The thyroxine nuclear protein solubilized from rat liver tissue also showed competitive binding interactions with similar structural specificity but with the additional requirement of a preference for structures which were planar and highly polarizable. A soluble dioxin approximate isostere shows a remarkably high affinity for the nuclear receptor. Thus the nuclear receptor affinity has the expected sensitivity for possible involvement in toxicity. Dose-dependent regulation (increase) of the T4 nuclear receptor number by dioxin was demonstrated and suggest a possible mechanism for potent and persistent expression of thyroid hormone activity which could result in toxicity.", "The 13th annual Gordon Conference on Phagocytes will be held June 12-17, 2005 at Connecticut College, New London, Connecticut. This Conference will be a forum for high-quality presentations and in depth discussions of the most recent discoveries in phagocyte biology and clinical extensions relevant to inflammation and host defense. The Conference has been in existence since 1981, and draws from a worldwide group of scientists with diverse backgrounds, including cell biology, biochemistry, molecular genetics, and clinical medicine. This meeting has consistently been an important venue for disseminating information and facilitating communication between investigators studying different facets of leukocyte biology as well as providing a general educational forum for trainees and young investigators in the field. Conferees attending the Gordon Conference on Phagocytes (session chairs, speakers, and participants) typically number 125-135. At the 2003 meeting, approximately 2/3rds of conferees were faculty-level research scientists and 1/3rd were graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. There are nine (9) planned sessions with a total of 30 plenary talks. A known expert in the field will chair each session. We also plan to include approximately 6-8 short talk presentations selected from abstracts submitted by meeting attendees. In addition, approximately 60 posters will be displayed. The program will provide opportunities for participation of scientists at all levels and we will particularly promote the participation of junior investigators, postdoctoral trainees and \"new investigators to the field\".", "Spinal pathologies and disorders such as scoliosis and other curvature abnormalities, kyphosis, degenerative disc disease, disc herniation, osteoporosis, spondylolisthesis, stenosis, tumor, and fracture may result from factors including trauma, disease and degenerative conditions caused by injury and aging. Spinal disorders typically result in symptoms including deformity, pain, nerve damage, and partial or complete loss of mobility.\nNon-surgical treatments, such as medication, rehabilitation and exercise can be effective, however, may fail to relieve the symptoms associated with these disorders. Surgical treatment of these spinal disorders includes fusion, fixation, correction, discectomy, laminectomy and implantable prosthetics. As part of these surgical treatments, spinal constructs, such as, for example, bone fasteners, spinal rods and interbody devices can be used to provide stability to a treated region. For example, during surgical treatment, surgical instruments can be used to deliver components of the spinal constructs to the surgical site for fixation with bone to immobilize a joint. Fasteners may also be attached to iliac bone. This disclosure describes an improvement over these prior art technologies.", "Comparison of omeprazole and pantoprazole influence on a high 150-mg clopidogrel maintenance dose the PACA (Proton Pump Inhibitors And Clopidogrel Association) prospective randomized study.\nThis study sought to compare the effect of 2 proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on platelet response to clopidogrel after coronary stenting for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE ACS). Use of omeprazole has been reported to significantly decrease the clopidogrel antiplatelet effect because of cytochrome P450 interaction. Because all PPIs are metabolized by CYP2C19, but to a varying degree, we hypothesized that the reported negative omeprazole-clopidogrel drug interaction may not be caused by a class effect. A total of 104 patients undergoing coronary stenting for NSTE ACS were prospectively included and randomized to omeprazole or pantoprazole 20 mg. They received at discharge 75-mg aspirin and 150-mg clopidogrel. Platelet reactivity index (PRI) vasoactive stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) was used to assess clopidogrel response and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced aggregation for platelet reactivity (ADP-Ag). After 1 month, patients receiving pantoprazole had a significantly better platelet response to clopidogrel as assessed with the PRI VASP: 36 +/- 20% versus 48 +/- 17% (p = 0.007). We identified more clopidogrel nonresponders in the omeprazole group than in the pantoprazole group: 44% versus 23% (p = 0.04), odds ratio: 2.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.2 to 6.2). Conversely, we did not observe any significant difference in platelet reactivity with ADP-Ag between the omeprazole and pantoprazole groups: 52 +/- 15% and 50 +/- 18%, respectively (p = 0.29). The present findings suggest the preferential use of pantoprazole compared with omeprazole in patients receiving clopidogrel to avoid any potential negative interaction with CYP2C19.", "Escherichia coli type III secretion system 2 (ETT2) is widely distributed in avian pathogenic Escherichia coli isolates from Eastern China.\nPathogens utilize type III secretion systems to deliver effector proteins, which facilitate bacterial infections. The Escherichia coli type III secretion system 2 (ETT2) which plays a crucial role in bacterial virulence, is present in the majority of E. coli strains, although ETT2 has undergone widespread mutational attrition. We investigated the distribution and characteristics of ETT2 in avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) isolates and identified five different ETT2 isoforms, including intact ETT2, in 57\u00b76% (141/245) of the isolates. The ETT2 locus was present in the predominant APEC serotypes O78, O2 and O1. All of the ETT2 loci in the serotype O78 isolates were degenerate, whereas an intact ETT2 locus was mostly present in O1 and O2 serotype strains, which belong to phylogenetic groups B2 and D, respectively. Interestingly, a putative second type III secretion-associated locus (eip locus) was present only in the isolates with an intact ETT2. Moreover, ETT2 was more widely distributed in APEC isolates and exhibited more isoforms compared to ETT2 in human extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, suggesting that APEC might be a potential risk to human health. However, there was no distinct correlation between ETT2 and other virulence factors in APEC.", "In vivo biocompatibility and biodegradation of a novel thin and mechanically stable collagen scaffold.\nThe demand for scaffolds comprised of natural materials such as collagen has increased in recent years. However, many scaffolds rely on chemical or physical modifications in order to comply with the necessary requirements for biomedical engineering. We evaluated the in vivo biocompatibility and biodegradation of a novel, thin, mechanically stable, and chemically non-crosslinked collagen cell carrier (CCC). CCC was implanted subcutaneously into 25 adult Lewis rats and biopsies were taken on days 7, 14, 21, 42, and 84 after surgery. For histological analysis, paraffin sections of implanted skin were immunolabeled for CD68 and stained by hematoxylin-eosin and Masson-Goldner's trichrome method. Macroscopic analysis of skin surface during wound healing process showed a normal physiological reaction. Biodegradation of CCC was completed 42 days after subcutaneous implantation. Histological evaluation revealed no evidence of encapsulation, scar formation, or long-term vascularization and inflammation. The collagen type I based biomaterial demonstrated a high in vivo biocompatibility, low irritability, complete resorption, and replacement by autologous tissue. The in vivo biocompatibility and degradation behavior encourage for further evaluation of CCC in surgical applications and regenerative medicine.", "Risk factors for graft failure in penetrating keratoplasty.\nWe clarified the preoperative risk factors for graft failure in penetrating keratoplasty with fresh donor corneas. This analysis covered 698 consecutive keratoplasty cases in a single center between 1971 and 1992, and was designed to assess the risk factors. The risk factors in penetrating keratoplasty were determined by the Cox multiple regression model which considers the follow-up periods and multiple factors simultaneously. The factors which worsen the prognosis of keratoplasty significantly were found to be preoperative endothelial dysfunction (hazard ratio = 2.3), prior glaucoma/ocular hypertension (hazard ratio = 2.0), preoperative corneal vascularization (hazard ratio for within one quadrant = 1.3, hazard ratio for 2 or more quadrants = 1.6), anterior synechiae of iris (hazard ratio = 1.5), aphakia or pseudophakia (hazard ratio = 1.4), and older donor age (hazard ratio = 1.3 in proportion to the increase of each 10-year period of age). Surgeons must take these risk factors into consideration to obtain a better prognosis for keratoplasty.", "The cytoprotective effects of bilirubin and biliverdin on rat hepatocytes and human erythrocytes and the impact of albumin.\nThe hypothesis that unconjugated bilirubin and biliverdin are cytoprotective antioxidants has been examined for the first time in systems containing cells. In primary rat hepatocytes exposed to xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine, bilirubin (0-60 microM) failed to prolong cell survival. In contrast, biliverdin (20-100 microM) markedly delayed hepatocyte necrosis in a concentration-dependent manner. When 0.3 mM of albumin was present, bilirubin (0-50 microM) became protective of hepatocytes, while biliverdin was less dramatically enhanced in its cytoprotective effect. In human erythrocytes exposed to peroxyl radicals, bilirubin and biliverdin inhibited 50% cell lysis at lower concentrations than Trolox and ascorbate, respectively. Albumin alone appeared less cytoprotective in red cells than in hepatocytes, but its presence enhanced the effects of both pigments on erythrocytes. Of probable physiologic relevance, bilirubin with albumin present or biliverdin alone protected hepatocytes substantially (and to a lesser extent red cells) at the normal blood levels of bilirubin (3.4-26 microM). Moreover, the fact that the pigments are cytoprotective at higher bilirubin levels (e.g., 50-100 microM) tempts the speculation that they may be circulating cytoprotectors of overlooked importance in jaundice.", "Food and nutrient intakes and eating patterns in functional and organic dyspepsia.\nForty organic dyspepsia patients and 40 functional dyspepsia patients, endoscopically diagnosed, were recruited from a gastroenterology outpatient unit and were age- and sex-matched with an equal number of patient controls. A diet history of typical eating patterns for a 7-day period was taken and food portions quantified using a photographic atlas. An interviewer-assisted questionnaire was used to identify present eating habits, dietary patterns reported to exacerbate or relieve symptoms and alterations in eating habits as a result of symptoms. Females with organic or functional dyspepsia reported significantly lower energy intakes (P < 0.01) than controls. Females with organic dyspepsia had significantly lower intakes of fat, carbohydrate, fibre and a wide range of micronutrients compared to controls. Females with functional dyspepsia had significantly lower intakes of fat, sugars and vitamin C (P < 0.05) than controls. Organic dyspepsia patients (male and female) had significantly lower intakes of alcohol and vitamin C than controls (P < 0.05). Patients with organic dyspepsia had higher intakes of milk and lower intakes of fresh fruit and/or fruit juice than controls. The main difference in eating pattern noted was that a significantly lower percentage (P < 0.05) of functional dyspepsia patients than controls regularly ate three meals per day. Large numbers of dyspepsia patients in both groups associated certain eating habits and the consumption of specific foods with exacerbation of dyspeptic symptoms and over 80% of both groups reported food avoidance as a result of this.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "Subarachnoid placement of stem cells in neurological disorders.\n\"Medically untreatable neurological disorders\" is an area where stem cell (SC) therapy has generated hope in the last decade. Among various routes for SC infusion, subarachnoid placement via the lumbar route is particularly challenging because of technical difficulties in this group of patients. We carried out a prospective, single-center, clinical study to analyze the technical difficulties and short- and long-term effects of SC infusion in various neurological conditions. One hundred eighty patients underwent subarachnoid placement of SCs between December 2005 and October 2007. Technical difficulties in the form of localization of subarachnoid space, number of attempts, and postprocedural complications were evaluated. Functional evaluation was done with Hauser Ambulation Index by the SC transplant team on a regular basis. The Institutional Review Board approved of informed consent forms and study protocol. Of 180 patients, we encountered technical difficulties in 52 (29%) in the form of general anesthesia supplementation and difficulty localizing the lumbar space. In 102 (56.6%) patients, side effects were observed (headache, low-grade fever, and meningism), which resolved with symptomatic treatment within 24 hours. On long-term follow-up, functional indices improved in 57 (31.67%) patients, including 54 patients with traumatic paraplegia/quadriplegia, two with cerebral palsy, and one with viral encephalitis. Subarachnoid placement of SCs is safe with no long term adverse effects.", "Effect of electrostatic interaction on fibril formation of human calcitonin as studied by high resolution solid state 13C NMR.\nFibrillation of a human calcitonin mutant (hCT) at the position of Asp(15) (D15N-hCT) was examined to reveal the effect of the electrostatic interaction of Asp(15) with charged side chains. The secondary structures of fibrils and soluble monomers in the site-specific (13)C-labeled D15N-hCTs were determined using (13)C cross-polarization magic angle spinning and dipolar decoupled magic angle spinning NMR approaches, sensitive to detect (13)C signals from the fibril and the soluble monomer, respectively. The local conformations and structures of D15N-hCT fibrils at pH 7.5 and 3.2 were found to be similar to each other and those of hCT at pH 3.3 and were interpreted as a mixture of antiparallel and parallel beta-sheets, whereas they were different from the hCT fibril at pH 7.5 whose structure is proposed to be antiparallel beta-sheets. Thus the negatively charged Asp(15) in the hCT molecule turned out to play an essential role in determining the structures and orientations of the hCT molecules. Fibrillation kinetics of D15N-hCT was analyzed using a two-step autocatalytic reaction mechanism. The results indicated that the replacement of Asp(15) with Asn(15) did not reduce the rate constants of the fibril formation but rather increased the rate constants at neutral pH.", "Design and development of a medical big data processing system based on Hadoop.\nSecondary use of medical big data is increasingly popular in healthcare services and clinical research. Understanding the logic behind medical big data demonstrates tendencies in hospital information technology and shows great significance for hospital information systems that are designing and expanding services. Big data has four characteristics--Volume, Variety, Velocity and Value (the 4 Vs)--that make traditional systems incapable of processing these data using standalones. Apache Hadoop MapReduce is a promising software framework for developing applications that process vast amounts of data in parallel with large clusters of commodity hardware in a reliable, fault-tolerant manner. With the Hadoop framework and MapReduce application program interface (API), we can more easily develop our own MapReduce applications to run on a Hadoop framework that can scale up from a single node to thousands of machines. This paper investigates a practical case of a Hadoop-based medical big data processing system. We developed this system to intelligently process medical big data and uncover some features of hospital information system user behaviors. This paper studies user behaviors regarding various data produced by different hospital information systems for daily work. In this paper, we also built a five-node Hadoop cluster to execute distributed MapReduce algorithms. Our distributed algorithms show promise in facilitating efficient data processing with medical big data in healthcare services and clinical research compared with single nodes. Additionally, with medical big data analytics, we can design our hospital information systems to be much more intelligent and easier to use by making personalized recommendations.", "Regulated expression of the human beta-globin gene family in murine erythroleukaemia cells.\nChemically induced differentiation of cultured murine erythroleukaemia (MEL) cells results in a several hundred-fold increase in transcription of the adult mouse globin genes and thus serves as a model for gene activation during erythropoiesis. One approach to study gene regulation in this system has been to analyse the expression of foreign globin genes introduced into MEL cells. By introducing cosmid DNA containing the human adult(beta), fetal(gamma) and embryonic(epsilon)-globin genes, we have shown here that expression of the beta, but not the gamma or epsilon genes, is regulated during MEL differentiation. Regulated expression of the human beta-globin gene was observed when it was introduced either as part of the intact globin gene cluster or as an individual gene with 1.5 kilobases (kb) of 5' flanking DNA. Transcription from a herpes simplex virus (HSV) promoter adjacent to the thymidine kinase (tk) gene is also inducible in MEL cells.", "Use of crossed cylinder lens in photographic lens evaluation.\nTwo methods are described for testing cameras and camera lenses by utilizing the properties of the crossed cylinder lens, an ophthalmic test device. In the first, the cylinder lens is used in conjunction with a rectangular grid to defocus the star image formed by a collimator. This test permits quantitative determination of axial chromatic aberration, spherical aberration and its variations with wavelength, and coma of the lens. In the second, a segment of the cylinder lens is used as a supplementary lens attachment to the camera, which photographs a polar coordinate chart. Analysis of the photograph permits determination of the sagittal and tangential field curvatures, and also indicates errors in focal adjustment and misalignment of film plane with respect to the lens axis. Since these tests require cylinder lenses of smaller dioptric power and quality superior to that available from the ophthalmic lens industry, methods for the construction and synthesis of large-aperture, weak, cross cylinder lenses and segments thereof are given. Experimental details of the lens testing procedures, together with examples of photographic determination of the various camera and lens defects, are presented. A sensitive test for lateral chromatic aberration is included in an appendix.", "Monitoring regional myocardial function after myocardial revascularization.\nA system using only small platinum electrodes for monitoring intramyocardial polarographic oxygen tension (MP02), electrograms (ECG), and impedance-derived wall motion (WM) was experimentally tested and clinically implemented. In nine open-chest, anesthetized dogs. two platinum electrodes were inserted along the subepicardial direction of the muscle fibers. As verified by cinefluoroscopy, WM corresponded to changes in distance between the platinum electrodes (r = 0.91 +/- 0.02). The system responded to a 10 minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) as follows: Dyskinetic WM appeared in 10 seconds (p less than 0.05); MP02 decreased (26.4 +/- 1.8 to 14.8 +/= 1.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) in 1 minute; ST segments increased (4.8 +/- 1.5 to 12.3 +/- 3.1 mV, p less than 0.05) in 3 minutes. On reperfusion, WM, ST segments, and MP02 normalized in 15 seconds, 30 seconds, and 1 minute, respectively. Hence, ischemia affects WM more acutely than either ECG or MP02. In five patients, ischemic changes before coronary bypass were reversed over 5 days: MP02 (17.4 +/-; 1.9 to 19.6 +/-1.7 mm Hg), ST segment (2.2 +/- 6 to 1.0 +/- 0.4 mV), and WM returned to normal. Thus a system has been designed which simultaneously monitors regional WM, MP02, and ECG. The method has proved to be a sensitive and practical approach for assessing perioperative myocardial function.", "Relationship between periodontal disease and osteoporosis.\nFor many years an association between the low bone density of osteoporosis and increased risk of periodontal bone loss has been suspected. In this review the relationship between osteoporosis and periodontal disease is considered. For this narrative review a very broad search strategy of the literature was developed using both PubMed and Scopus databases using the search words \"perio\" and \"osteoporosis\". The reference lists from the selected papers were also scanned and this provided an additional source of papers for inclusion. The inclusion/exclusion criteria, were also quite liberal with only those papers dealing with bisphosphonates and osteonecrosis of the jaws, osteoporosis in edentulous individuals, as well as those not written in English being excluded. The data available suggest that reduced bone mineral density is a shared risk factor for periodontitis rather than a causal factor. However, more prospective studies are required to fully determine what, if any, relationship truly exists between periodontitis and reduced bone mineral density. More prospective studies are required to determine what, if any, relationships exist between periodontal disease and reduced bone mineral density.", "Helicobacter mustelae-associated hypergastrinemia in ferrets (Mustela putorius furo).\nTo determine whether ferrets naturally infected with Helicobacter mustelae were hypergastrinemic, compared with ferrets that were specific-pathogen-free (SPF) for H mustelae. Plasma gastrin concentrations in H mustelae-infected and SPF ferrets were measured at 3 time points and compared to determine whether H mustelae was associated with hypergastrinemia. 21 H mustelae-infected ferrets and 10 SPF ferrets. The H mustelae status of the ferrets was confirmed prior to commencement of the study. Gastric endoscopy was used to obtain gastric mucosal pinch biopsy specimens that were processed for rapid-urease assay, microaerophilic culturing, and histologic evaluation. Plasma gastrin concentrations were determined at 3 time points: baseline after a 12-hour nonfeeding period, and 30 and 60 minutes after oral administration of a standardized meal. Gastrin was measured by radioimmunoassay. The results for the H mustelae-infected group (mean +/- SEM pg/ml) were: baseline, 54.4 +/- 2.56; 30 minutes, 94.5 +/- 6.05; and 60 minutes, 82.6 +/- 5.73. The SPF group results were: baseline, 55.8 +/- 7.35; 30 minutes, 80.8 +/- 5.77; and 60 minutes, 59.7 +/- 4.95. There was a significant (P < 0.01) difference at the 60-minute time point between the 2 groups of animals. The H mustelae group had a 17% higher mean gastrin value at 30 minutes. Helicobacter mustelae is associated with hypergastrinemia in ferrets. Helicobacter-induced hypergastrinemia may be related to the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease in ferrets.", "Prospective analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms of the transforming growth factor beta-1 gene in Peyronie's disease.\nThe detection of increased expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) in Peyronie's disease plaques and the possibility of initiating a Peyronie's disease-like condition by intratunical injection of a synthetic heptopeptide with TGF-beta-like activity in an animal model has provided evidence for the central role of this cytokine in the pathogenesis of this entity. Recently 2 defined single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding region of the TGF-beta1 gene have been described that are associated with different levels of TGF-beta1 production. Based on these data we prospectively investigated the genetic association of distinct TGF-beta1 genotypes with Peyronie's disease. DNA samples from 111 consecutive patients with idiopathic Peyronie's disease and 100 controls were genotyped for the 2 defined dimorphic single nucleotide polymorphisms T869C and G915C in the coding region of the TGF-beta1 gene using allele specific polymerase chain reaction. We found an increased frequency of the homozygous genotype of the single nucleotide polymorphism G915C in patients with Peyronie's disease compared with healthy controls (89.2% versus 79%, p = 0.04). However, there were no significant differences in allele frequencies of the single nucleotide polymorphism T869C. Experimental data from other investigators have shown that TGF-beta1 has an important role in the etiopathology of Peyronie's disease. Our results indicate that the homozygous wild type of the G915C single nucleotide polymorphism in the coding region of the TGF-beta1 gene, which was recently associated with elevated TGF-beta1 production and pulmonary fibrosis, may influence the predisposition to Peyronie's disease. However, it does not represent a major genetic risk factor.", "Chinese herbal medicine for functional constipation: a randomised controlled trial.\n1. This was an 18-week prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study on a Chinese herbal medicine--ma zi ren wan (MZRW)--for the treatment of functional constipation. 2. 120 subjects with functional constipation (Rome III criteria) were randomised (60 per arm) into the MZRW and placebo groups. Respective responder rates for the two groups were 43.3% and 8.3% during treatment, and 30.0% and 15.0% in the follow-up period (p<0.05). The MZRW group was superior to the placebo group in terms of increased complete spontaneous bowel movement as well as reduction in severity of constipation, straining at evacuation, and use of rescue therapy. No serious adverse effects were reported. 3. The dose of MZRW (7.5 g bid) was determined in a separate clinical trial. This study entailed a dose determination study and then a placebo-controlled clinical trial and can be a good reference for future studies.", "Detection of Leishmania (L.) chagasi in canine skin.\nCanine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is caused by a protozoa parasite of the specie Leishmania (L.) chagasi endemic for humans and dogs in many regions of Brazil. The purpose of the present study was the detection of (L.) chagasi in canine skin tissues from three different groups of clinical signs: asymptomatic, oligosymptomatic and polysymptomatic Leishmania-infected dogs. Lesional or non-lesional skin tissue samples from 34 naturally infected dogs were obtained and processed by histochemistry (HE) and immunohistochemistry (IMHC) for direct parasitological examination and the results were compared with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. IMHC and HE methods detected intact Leishmania-amastigote parasites in lesional and no lesional skin, particularly in asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic dogs. 50% of skin samples collected from asymptomatic and 21.4% from oligosymptomatic dogs had parasites in their skins even though with mild inflammatory reaction or without any macroscopic dermatological alterations. On the other hand, 100% of polysymptomatic dogs showed several forms of clinical dermatological alterations and 91.7% had intact amastigotes with parasite load ranging from mild to intense. By PCR, DNA of Leishmania spp. was detected in 97.8% skin samples regardless clinical status of the dogs or IMHC/HE test results. PCR on skin was a sensitive procedure for CVL diagnosis, but direct observation of intact parasite in skin biopsies, particularly by IMHC, may be also considered to support the diagnosis.", "Herpes simplex type 1 shedding is associated with reduced hospital survival in patients receiving assisted ventilation in a tertiary referral intensive care unit.\nThe impact of shedding of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) on hospital survival of patients receiving assisted ventilation in an adult tertiary referral, acute trauma intensive care unit was assessed. The study was designed to address a clinical impression linking HSV-1 recovery with poor survival. Two hundred and forty-one males and 152 females were enrolled into a longitudinal cohort study. Combined throat swabs and tracheal secretions were tested for HSV-1 shedding using a nested nucleic acid amplification protocol; patients were ranked as nonshedders, shedders, and high-level shedders. Nonparametric analysis assessed the impact of shedding on hospital survival and logistic regression measured the confounding influence of sex, age, and the Acute Physiology, Age and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score. Linear-by-linear association determined the influence of the level of shedding on hospital survival. The observed mortality rate was 113/393 (28.8%). Patients shedding HSV-1 106/393 (27%) had a significant reduction in hospital survival 66/106 (62%) in HSV-1 shedders compared with 217/287 (75.6%) in nonshedders (P = 0.002). This difference remained significant when adjusted for age and sex (P = 0.026). Respective mortality figures for HSV-1 shedders and nonshedders were 43/106 (40.6%) and 70/287 (24.4%) (P = 0.002). HSV-1 shedding was associated with a significant reduction in hospital survival amongst patients receiving assisted ventilation. Hospital mortality in HSV-1 shedders was increased by 16.2% over nonshedders. The role of HSV-1 in this setting needs to be addressed.", "Antibodies directed against idiotypic determinants on anti-staphylococcal nuclease antibodies from different mouse strains have been produced in rats and in pigs. The idiotypes are detected by hemagglutination assays and by the inhibition of antibody-mediated inactivation of nuclease. The latter assay is specific for the combining sites (variable regions) of antinuclease antibodies, since extensive absorption of anti-idiotype sera with normal mouse immunoglobulins fails to diminish their activity, and since antibodies to other sites on the Ig molecule do not inhibit inactivation. By screening a variety of strains and offspring from appropriate matings between strains for the presence of idiotypes and other markers, it has been shown that idiotype expression is linked to the heavy chain allotype marker and not to the immune response gene locus. A number of recombinants between different idiotype markers have been found and may provide tools for fine-structure mapping of heavy chain variable region genes. In vivo effects of anti-idiotype antibodies are also being assessed.", "Caregivers' expectations and care receivers' competence Lawton's ecological model of adaptation and aging revisited.\nDrawing upon Lawton's ecological model of adaptation and old age, this study analyses the implications of the degree of adjustment (congruence) between the self-assessed functional capacity of 33 community-dwelling elderly care receivers and their functional capacity as assessed by their respective family caregivers (N=33), for the adaptation of the elderly and for their caregivers' feelings of burden, defined as their perception of how the caregiving activity is affecting their physical, psychological and social well-being. Three groups were set up on the basis of the level of congruence between caregivers' and care receivers' reports: high capacity attribution, coincidental capacity attribution, and low capacity attribution groups. No group differences were found in the care receivers' level of functional independence as perceived by their caregivers and as assessed by the Katz Index and the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale. However, the results showed differences between the three groups in relation to both the care receivers' adaptation when viewed in terms of their psychological well-being and self-efficacy. Differences between the caregivers' perceived sense of burden and their perception of their relatives' independence were also found. As proposed by the Lawton model, the results support the psychological benefits, both for the caregiver and the care receiver, of an appropriate balance between the socio-environmental demands (caregivers' expectations regarding care receivers' competence) and the capacity of the individual.", "Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in vitro.\nThe activity of purified bovine thymus terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was markedly inhibited when the enzyme was incubated in a poly(ADP-ribose)-synthesizing system containing purified bovine thymus poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, NAD+, Mg2+ and DNA. All of these four components were indispensable for the inhibition. The inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase counteracted the observed inhibition of the transferase. Under a Mg2+-depleted and acceptor-dependent ADP-ribosylating reaction condition [Tanaka, Y., Hashida, T., Yoshihara, H. and Yoshihara, K. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 12433-12438], the addition of terminal transferase to the reaction mixture stimulated the enzyme reaction in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the transferase is functioning as an acceptor for ADP-ribose. Electrophoretic analyses of the reaction products clearly indicated that the transferase molecule itself was oligo (ADP-ribosyl)ated. When the product was further incubated in the Mg2+-fortified reaction mixture, the activity of terminal transferase markedly decreased with increase in the apparent molecular size of the enzyme, indicating that an extensive elongation of poly(ADP-ribose) bound to the transferase is essential for the observed inhibition. Free poly(ADP-ribose) and the polymer bound to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were ineffective on the activity of the transferase. All of these results indicate that the observed inhibition of terminal transferase is caused by the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the transferase itself.", "Interferon and chronic myelogenous leukaemia.\nInterferon (IFN) is widely employed in the therapy of chronic myelogenous leukaemia because of its ability to exert the antiproliferative activity on leukaemic haematopoietic progenitors and for the expression for IFN-alpha receptors by peripheral blood leukaemic cell surfaces. There is no difference between recombinant IFN alpha 2b and alpha 2a regarding their efficacy in the treatment of Ph-positive CML patients. Either no randomized studies or the randomized ones show a superior effectiveness of IFN given as single agent in the induction treatment to that one of chemotherapy regarding the complete cytogenic response percentage. The ability of IFN-gamma to induce the expression of adhesion molecules such LFA 1 and ICAM 1 on peripheral blood leukaemic cell surfaces may suggest its use in the induction therapy of CML patients. Other than, a superior effectiveness of combined therapy including interferon and chemotherapy agents compared to chemotherapy alone has also been found. Finally no large series of trials to study the IFN efficacy both as second line treatment and maintenance therapy have been carried out.", "Ecological characterization of Heterorhabditis sonorensis (Caborca strain) (Nematoda: Heterorhabditidae), an entomopathogenic nematode from the Sonoran Desert.\nHeterorhabditis nematodes are parasites of a wide range of soil-dwelling insect species. Although these nematodes have been exploited as biological control agents since the last half of the 20th century, much research remains to be done to understand how these organisms function in agricultural and other ecosystems. In this study, we present some ecological traits of Heterorhabditis sonorensis, a natural parasite of the cicada Diceroprocta ornea, from the Sonoran Desert. Specifically, we evaluated its infectivity across a diverse panel of insect groups and assessed its fitness (infectivity and reproduction) considering different temperatures, and soil moisture levels. Three other Heterorhabditis species served as points of comparison for temperature and soil moisture assays. Host range experiments indicate that H. sonorensis, although isolated from seasonal cicada nymphs, is more virulent and reproductively fit in the lepidopteran hosts tested. This nematode has an optimum temperature range at 25-30 \u00b0C but can also successfully reproduce at temperatures ranging from 15 to 35 \u00b0C. Additionally, this nematode is adapted to a variety of soil moisture conditions with successful infections across the tested moisture range (3%-20%). Finally, we demonstrate that H. sonorensis infective juveniles have a high survival rate (over 80%) at various storage temperatures (10-25 \u00b0C) after 24 weeks of storage and remain infective as revealed by the post-storage infection assays.", "HIV-1 is the causative agent of AIDS. To date there are no promising vaccines or drugs to combat HIV-1. Our approach to the AIDS problem is to use peptide chemistry to develop potential vaccine candidates and new drugs. The work is based on the fact that CD-4 is the cellular receptor for the virus and that the amino acid sequence of CD-4 is well-known. In addition, we are relying on published data to guide us in determining the ligand for CD-4 on the virus. Our goal is to design and synthesize reagents that are capable of blocking the binding of the virus to cells. Anti-viral drugs will be conjugated to these reagents and the conjugates will be tested to evaluate their in vitro efficacy. The primary focus of our work is to develop a \"guided missile\" anti HIV- 1 reagent. Such a reagent should be able to recognize the receptor for the virus, bind to the receptor and enter the cell through the receptor. In addition, our goal is to not damage the cell but to kill the virus. We are currently developing monoclonal antibodies directed against CD-4, the HIV-1 receptor. Antibodies are against peptides derived from the receptor and should react with the native receptor protein. This makes them unique from what is commercially available. Studies are currently underway to evaluate which anti CD-4 monoclonals are taken up by CD-4 expressing cells. The techniques involved include peptide synthesis, receptor isolation and characterization, amino acid analyses, high performance liquid chromatography, affinity chromatography, new methods of conjugating nucleic acids to antibodies, antibody development and all the associative methods involved in production of specific monoclonals. Cell culture is used to produce large amounts of cells bearing the CD-4 receptor for use in our studies.", "Orthostatic vasoconstrictor response in patients with occlusive arterial disease assessed by laser Doppler flux and transcutaneous oximetry.\nPosturally induced microvascular constriction normally causes a decrease of transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tcPO2) and laser Doppler flux (LDF) measured on the forefoot at 37 degrees C. The authors used both methods to assess the vasoconstrictor response (VCR) in 31 patients with various degrees of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and analyzed factors that could have influenced the response. Disturbed VCR was indicated by a signal increase following leg dependency, which occurred significantly more often in tcPO2 than in LDF measurements (69% vs 32%, P < 0.001). Correspondingly the median sitting/supine ratio was 2.4 for tcPO2 and 0.7 for LDF (P < 0.0001). Age and clinical stage had no influence on the VCR. With ankle artery pressures below 50 mmHg an increase of LDF was more probable. TcPO2 predominantly increased with ankle artery pressure up to 100 mmHg, though the sitting/supine ratio of tcPO2 was correlated with ankle artery pressure. In nondiabetics the response of tcPO2 but not of LDF was influenced by the values at rest. Differences between the two methods may be explained in part by their different sample volumes. The authors assume that tcPO2 is predominantly monitoring a local myogenic response while LDF is reflecting venoarteriolar response.", "Primary and secondary phosphine complexes of iron porphyrins and ruthenium phthalocyanine: synthesis, structure, and P-H bond functionalization.\nReduction of [Fe(III)(Por)Cl] (Por = porphyrinato dianion) with Na2S2O4 followed by reaction with excess PH2Ph, PH2Ad, or PHPh2 afforded [Fe(II)(F20-TPP)(PH2Ph)2] (1a), [Fe(II)(F20-TPP)(PH2Ad)2] (1b), [Fe(II)(F20-TPP)(PHPh2)2] (2a), and [Fe(II)(2,6-Cl2TPP)(PHPh2)2] (2b). Reaction of [Ru(II)(Pc)(DMSO)2] (Pc = phthalocyaninato dianion) with PH2Ph or PHPh2 gave [Ru(II)(Pc)(PH2Ph)2] (3a) and [Ru(II)(Pc)(PHPh2)2] (4). [Ru(II)(Pc)(PH2Ad)2] (3b) and [Ru(II)(Pc)(PH2Bu(t))2] (3c) were isolated by treating a mixture of [Ru(II)(Pc)(DMSO)2] and O=PCl2Ad or PCl2Bu(t) with LiAlH4. Hydrophosphination of CH2=CHR (R = CO2Et, CN) with [Ru(II)(F20-TPP)(PH2Ph)2] or [Ru(II)(F20-TPP)(PHPh2)2] in the presence of (t)BuOK led to the isolation of [Ru(II)(F20-TPP)(P(CH2CH2R)2Ph)2] (R = CO2Et, 5a; CN, 5b) and [Ru(II)(F20-TPP)(P(CH2CH2R)Ph2)2] (R = CO2Et, 6a; CN, 6b). Similar reaction of 3a with CH2=CHCN or MeI gave [Ru(II)(Pc)(P(CH2CH2CN)2Ph)2] (7) or [Ru(II)(Pc)(PMe2Ph)2] (8). The reactions of 4 with CH2=CHR (R = CO2Et, CN, C(O)Me, P(O)(OEt)2, S(O)2Ph), CH2=C(Me)CO2Me, CH(CO2Me)=CHCO2Me, MeI, BnCl, and RBr (R = (n)Bu, CH2=CHCH2, MeC[triple bond]CCH2, HC[triple bond]CCH2) in the presence of (t)BuOK afforded [Ru(II)(Pc)(P(CH2CH2R)Ph2)2] (R = CO2Et, 9a; CN, 9b; C(O)Me, 9c; P(O)(OEt)2, 9d; S(O)2Ph, 9e), [Ru(II)(Pc)(P(CH2CH(Me)CO2Me)Ph2)2] (9f), [Ru(II)(Pc)(P(CH(CO2Me)CH2CO2Me)Ph2)2] (9g), and [Ru(II)(Pc)(PRPh2)2] (R = Me, 10a; Bu(n), 10b; Bn, 10c; CH2CH=CH2, 10d; CH2C[triple bond]CMe, 10e; CH=C=CH2, 10f). X-ray crystal structure determinations revealed Fe-P distances of 2.2597(9) (1a) and 2.309(2) A (2bx 2 CH2Cl2) and Ru-P distances of 2.3707(13) (3b), 2.373(2) (3c), 2.3478(11) (4), and 2.3754(10) A (5b x 2 CH2Cl2). Both the crystal structures of 3b and 4 feature intermolecular C-H...pi interactions, which link the molecules into 3D and 2D networks, respectively.", "The effect of raising gastric pH with ranitidine on the absorption and elimination of theophylline from a sustained-release theophylline tablet.\nPrior to evaluating the effect of ranitidine on theophylline absorption from a sustained-release theophylline tablet, the effect of ranitidine on the time course of gastric pH in 12 healthy subjects was evaluated with an encapsulated radio-telemetry device (Heidelberg capsule). Gastric pH was measured hourly from 7 AM to 1 PM prior to beginning ranitidine treatment at 2 PM (150 mg every 4 hr for eight doses). The next day, pH was again measured hourly from 7 AM to 7 PM. Subjects fasted overnight and remained fasted until lunch at 11 AM. Prior to ranitidine treatment, the mean morning gastric pH remained between 1.5 and 2.2. After lunch, the pH increased to 2.2-2.3. During ranitidine treatment the mean morning gastric pH measurements were 5.5 to 5.8, decreasing after lunch to 3.1 by 4 PM and increasing to 3.9 at 7 PM. One week later the subjects participated in a three-way crossover theophylline bioavailability study receiving at weekly intervals, single doses at 7 AM of (a) 5 x 100-mg immediate-release tablets, (b) 2 x 300-mg sustained-release theophylline tablets, and (c) 2 x 300-mg sustained-release theophylline tablets after ranitidine pretreatment of 150 mg every 4 hr beginning at 2 PM the previous day. The increase in gastric pH with ranitidine had no effect (P greater than 0.05) on the rate and extent of absorption or on the elimination rate of theophylline.", "[Psychological examinations of the personality of patients with cardiac syndrome X].\n76 patients with chest pain including 27 men and 49 women from 25 to 75 (mean 49.96 +/- 11.36) years old, were examined by means of the psychological test. All the patients showed positive exercise test and no changes in coronary arteries. Psychological test was done by the use of personality--MMPI--2 (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory) test and depression was diagnosed by GDS (Geriatric Depression Scale) by J. Yesavage--15 questions version. The highest mean values in MMPI--2 were obtained in neurotic scales. It indicates that emotional disorders in these patients emerge as hypochondriacal and hysterical neurosis. In 37 patients (48.7%) neurotic scales showed typical \"conversion valley\" and these who show such a change in MMPI--2 talk mainly about somatic complains (not psychological) during long-term stress situation. In 25 (32.9%) patients single psychological symptoms of depression could be seen and depression episodes were diagnosed in 17 patients (22.4%).", "Comparative study of the effects of some inducers with or without protein binding properties on bioavailability of isoxazolylpenicillins in rats.\nThe effect of various inducers with or without protein binding properties on serum levels and half life of Oxacillin, Cloxacillin and Dicloxacillin was studied. A total of 102 male rats classified in 3 \"categories\" according to the administered penicillin with 6 groups of rats in each of them were used. Each group was pretreated for 15 days with the following inducers: phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin, diazepam, chlorpromazine and phenylbutazone. The control groups received saline. The d-glucaric acid concentration in the urine prior to and after the administration of inducers and the liver weight were taken as enzyme induction indices. The results showed a decrease of serum levels and half life of three penicillins with a negative correlation between urine d-glucaric acid and serum penicillin levels. Phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin and chlorpromazine affected the 3 penicillins in the following statistically significant order: oxacillin, dicloxacillin, cloxacillin. Diazepam affected: cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, oxacillin, and phenylbutazone: dicloxacillin, cloxacillin and oxacillin. However all drugs finally produced a uniform effect on all 3 penicillins in the following decreasing order: phenobarbital (r = -0.910), diphenylhydantoin (r = -0.864), phenylbutazone (r = -0.851), chlorpromazine (r = -0.842) and diazepam (r = -0.821). For all inducers, the effect was most significant for oxacillin (r = -0.869), second most significant for dicloxacillin (r = -0.811) and finally for cloxacillin (r = -0.778). The results suggested an interaction of isoxazolylpenicillins and the above drugs.", "Since the invention of the single transistor dynamic memory cell, the basic rule of one transistor and one capacitor per stored bit has not changed. In order to pack more bits per unit of silicon area, more sophisticated lithographic equipment and methods are continuously being developed and used to fabricate these memory devices. Another way to achieve better density is to store more than one data bit per single memory cell. This is known commonly as multi-level cell memory. Prior art patents that discuss multi-level storage in dynamic semiconductor memory include U.S. Pat. No 5,293,563 of Ohta for MULTI-LEVEL MEMORY CELL WITH INCREASED READ-OUT MARGIN (\"Ohta\"). Ohta describes a dynamic semiconductor memory device using a memory cell consisting of two (2) transistors and a capacitor to store two bits of digital data. The result is a memory device using one and one-half (1.5) elements instead of two (2) elements per bit of storage. Ohta provides an enhanced cell signal storage with complementary polarities applied to the memory cell. One major disadvantage of the cell is its layout difficulty which results in larger than expected actual cell size.\nU.S. Pat. No. 5,283,761 of Gillingham entitled METHOD OF MULTI-LEVEL STORAGE IN DRAM (\"Gillingham\") describes a DRAM memory cell capable of storing four (4) voltage levels. To do this, Gillingham subdivides the bit line, uses about six (6) precharge and equalizing clocks involving complex and difficult to generate clock timings (including some precharge and isolation clocks twice activated in a single cycle), and a dummy word line. The bit line sections also have to be charged, equalized and discharged twice in a single cycle, resulting in a slow memory device, not suitable for high speed dynamic operation in high density DRAMs.", "Genome-wide transcriptional response of microRNAs to the benzo(a)pyrene stress in amphioxus Branchiostoma belcheri.\nAmphioxus, a cephalochordate found in sand habitats in shallow in-shore seawaters, has been widely used as a model in comparative immunology of chordates. However, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in amphioxus under abiotic stress, particularly xenobiotics with strong toxicity, remains largely unknown. Here, a widespread marine contaminant, benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is used to evaluate its toxic effects on miRNA expression of amphioxus. Six small RNA libraries were sequenced from Branchiostoma belcheri. A total of 144 known and 157 novel miRNAs were identified using deep sequencing and bioinformatics approaches. A total of 58 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were screened, including 25 up- and 33 down-regulated DEMs under BaP stress. Target genes possibly regulated by DEMs were predicted, and their functional enrichment analyses were performed. Targets of DEMs are primarily involved in xenobiotic and cellular homeostasis, catabolic and transport process. They could be largely linked to nine immune- and toxin detoxification-related pathways, including metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, drug metabolism-other enzymes, and drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, etc. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis for 12 key BaP-responsive DEMs validates the accuracy of deep sequencing. Experiments were then conducted to investigate their expression responses to BaP stress at different time intervals in detail to further determine their expression dynamic in responses of B. belcheri towards BaP exposure. This study, to the best of our knowledge, investigates the regulatory roles of miRNAs in the toxicological response of amphioxus for the first time, providing valuable information for the protection of lone existing cephalochordate amphioxus.", "Mitochondrial respiration and Ca2+ waves are linked during fertilization and meiosis completion.\nFertilization increases both cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration and oxygen consumption in the egg but the relationship between these two phenomena remains largely obscure. We have measured mitochondrial oxygen consumption and the mitochondrial NADH concentration on single ascidian eggs and found that they increase in phase with each series of meiotic Ca(2+) waves emitted by two pacemakers (PM1 and PM2). Oxygen consumption also increases in response to Ins(1,4,5)P(3)-induced Ca(2+) transients. Using mitochondrial inhibitors we show that active mitochondria sequester cytosolic Ca(2+) during sperm-triggered Ca(2+) waves and that they are strictly necessary for triggering and sustaining the activity of the meiotic Ca(2+) wave pacemaker PM2. Strikingly, the activity of the Ca(2+) wave pacemaker PM2 can be restored or stimulated by flash photolysis of caged ATP. Taken together our observations provide the first evidence that, in addition to buffering cytosolic Ca(2+), the egg's mitochondria are stimulated by Ins(1,4,5)P(3)-mediated Ca(2+) signals. In turn, mitochondrial ATP production is required to sustain the activity of the meiotic Ca(2+) wave pacemaker PM2.", "Risk of cardiovascular outcomes in users of estradiol/dydrogesterone or other HRT preparations.\nUse of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) used to be promoted to reduce the risk of ischemic cardiovascular diseases, a concept which has been challenged by results of the large Women's Health Initiative trial in users of estrogen and progestin. It is postulated that the type of progestin used in HRT affects the cardiovascular risk. We used the UK-based General Practice Research Database to conduct a follow-up study with a nested case-control analysis. We assessed and compared the risk of developing myocardial infarction, thrombotic stroke or venous thromboembolism in estradiol/dydrogesterone users, users of other HRT, or non-users of HRT. The incidence rates of myocardial infarction, thrombotic stroke and venous thromboembolism in estradiol/dydrogesterone users were 0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18-0.76), 0.27 (95% CI 0.10-0.58) and 0.31 (95% CI 0.13-0.64) per 1000 person-years, respectively. As compared to non-users of HRT, the adjusted relative risk estimates (odds ratios) in the nested case-control analysis for estradiol/dydrogesterone users or users of other HRT were 1.06 (95% CI 0.48-2.36) and 1.12 (95% CI 0.84-1.51) for myocardial infarction, 0.50 (95% CI 0.21-1.22) and 1.18 (95% CI 0.94-1.48) for thrombotic stroke, and 0.84 (95% CI 0.37-1.92) and 1.42 (95% CI 1.10-1.82) for venous thromboembolism, respectively. The study provides evidence that estradiol/dydrogesterone use of several months to a few years is not associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events than use of other HRT.", "A novel role for nitric oxide in the endogenous degradation of heparan sulfate during recycling of glypican-1 in vascular endothelial cells.\nWe show here that the endothelial cell-line ECV 304 expresses the heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican-1. The predominant cellular glycoform carries truncated side-chains and is accompanied by heparan sulfate oligosaccharides. Treatment with brefeldin A results in accumulation of a glypican proteoglycan with full-size side-chains while the oligosaccharides disappear. During chase the glypican proteoglycan is converted to partially degraded heparan sulfate chains and chain-truncated proteoglycan, both of which can be captured by treatment with suramin. The heparan sulfate chains in the intact proteoglycan can be depolymerized by nitrite-dependent cleavage at internally located N-unsubstituted glucosamine moieties. Inhibition of NO-synthase or nitrite-deprivation prevents regeneration of intact proteoglycan from truncated precursors as well as formation of oligosaccharides. In nitrite-deprived cells, formation of glypican proteoglycan is restored when NO-donor is supplied. We propose that, in recycling glypican-1, heparan sulfate chains are cleaved at or near glucosamines with unsubstituted amino groups. NO-derived nitrite is then required for the removal of short, nonreducing terminal saccharides containing these N-unsubstituted glucosamine residues from the core protein stubs, facilitating re-synthesis of heparan sulfate chains.", "Antibody repertoire development in fetal and neonatal piglets. I. Four VH genes account for 80 percent of VH usage during 84 days of fetal life.\nVDJ rearrangement and VH gene usage during fetal development in 35 outbred piglets was examined by PCR amplification of VDJs; VDJs were subsequently characterized by hybridization with VH-specific gene probes and by sequencing. VDJ rearrangement was first seen in the fetal liver on day 30 of a 114-day gestation. Four VH genes (V(H)A, V(H)B, V(H)C, and V(H)E) accounted for approximately 80% of all VH gene usage regardless of gestational age, choice of piglet, or lymphoid tissue tested; D(H)A and D(H)B were used in >90% of the fetal VDJs examined. Evidence of somatic hypermutation during fetal development was not found. The proportion of the four prominent fetal VH genes did not differ significantly between cDNA and DNA, suggesting the absence of selective B cell differentiation. A comparison of recombination signal sequences, flanking sequences, and framework sequences of these fetal genes with other germline VH genes of swine offered no clue as to their selective usage. N-region additions were prominent on day 40 but not on day 30, suggesting that the onset of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase activity occurs after 30 days of fetal development. These collective findings indicate that the preimmune, \"natural Ab\" repertoire of the fetal piglet is largely restricted to the use of four nonpolymorphic and nonmutated VH genes and two nonmutated DH segments. This suggests that the preimmune repertoire of swine is either highly restricted or almost entirely determined by junctional diversity in complementarity-determining region-3.", "A device is proposed for extracting a fine sample from a sample substrate as a sample preparation device facilitating preparation of a fine sample piece used for analysis devices, combining focused ion beam (Focused Ion BEAM: hereinafter abbreviated to as FIB) processing and micromanipulation technology. Such a technique is described in JP Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 5-052721 A (1993). Such a sample preparation device employs a probe in a charged particle device. The sample preparation device separates the fine sample for analysis from the sample substrate due to FIB processing. Moreover, this fine sample for analysis can be held and carried using the probe. The shape of the probe is recognized based on a scanning ion microscopy image (Scanning Ion Microscope: hereinafter referred to as SIM image) due to ion beam scanning and secondary electron detection. Moreover, there is also a technique for recognizing the shape of the probe based on an incoming current image obtained by synchronizing an incoming current of the probe and a scanning signal of a charged particle beam. Such a technique is described in JP Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2000-171364 A.", "Lewis Acid Activation and Catalysis of Dialkylaminyl Radical Reactions.\nLewis acid activation and catalysis of dialkylaminyl radical reactions is demonstrated both qualitatively and quantitatively. Cyclization of the N-butyl-4-pentenaminyl radical (1) in the presence of a wide range of Lewis acids was shown to be efficient with good to excellent yields of cyclic products obtained in reactions conducted even at -78 degrees C. Rate constants for fragmentation of the N-ethyl-2,2-diphenylethylaminyl radical (6), 6-exo cyclization of the N-methyl-6,6-diphenyl-5-hexenaminyl radical (7), and 5-exo cyclization of the N-methyl-5,5-diphenyl-4-pentenaminyl radical (8) in the presence of the Lewis acids LiBF(4), MgBr(2), and BF(3) were measured by laser flash photolysis (LFP) methods. The LFP studies demonstrated saturation kinetic behavior with respect to the Lewis acids. Equilibrium binding constants for the Lewis acids with the dialkylaminyl radicals and rate constants for reactions of the Lewis acid complexed dialkylaminyl radicals were obtained from nonlinear regression analysis of the observed rate constants.", "It is well recognized that hydrogen fuel generated from renewable power would be a desirable option to continued use of fossil fuels. Hydrogen powered fuel cells are developing rapidly, are more efficient than internal combustion engines, and have only water as an emission. Unfortunately, hydrogen storage systems suitable for automotive and other small-scale industrial or residential applications remain elusive. Solid state hydrogen materials such as metal hydrides or chemical hydride are some of the best potential materials for solving this problem. Unfortunately these materials have their own problems including poor reversibility, unacceptable reaction kinetics, and inadequate thermal conductivity. A cursory review of known hydrides reveals that materials with a high hydrogen content react at thermodynamically difficult temperatures and/or pressures whereas those with reasonable re/dehydrogenation contain little hydrogen. Hydride-based storage materials have been mixed with materials such as expanded graphite, porous aluminum foams, and porous silicon. While the exact mechanism that causes these materials to be of benefit is not always clear, the results have clearly demonstrated improvements to the reaction kinetics or thermodynamics of the hydriding or dehydriding reaction.\nDespite the advances in hydrogen storage materials noted above, a need exists for improved hydrogen storage materials and methods for making these materials. The present invention seeks to fulfill these needs and provides further related advantages.", "Mapping dietary habits may provide clues about the factors that determine food choice.\nFood deserts are thought to be a barrier to making healthier food choices. This concept has been challenged. The interaction between the physical environment and children's food choice has received little attention. The present study used food intake data to generate hypotheses concerning the role of the physical environment in food choice. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted of the dietary habits of Year 5 (9-10-year-old) children from 90 of Liverpool's 118 primary schools. Individuals with the 'best' and 'worst' food choices were mapped and two areas associated with these extreme choices located. One thousand five hundred and thirty-five children completed the dietary questionnaire and supplied a full and valid postcode. Two adjacent areas with relatively large numbers of children in the 'best' and 'worst' food choice groups were chosen. Both areas had very similar socio-economic profiles. The contrast in the physical environments was striking, even on visual inspection. Food deserts as a cause of poor food choice did not stand scrutiny; the area located by the worst food choices had a plethora of shops selling food (better termed a food prairie), whereas the area located by the best food choices had no shops in evidence but did have more 'space'.", "[Quinidine plasma concentration-cardiac electrophysiologic effects relationships in anesthetized dogs (author's transl)].\n1. The electrophysiologic effects of quinidine (Q)were studied in 15 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs using intracardiac electrography and programmed stimulation. With four successive bolus i.v. injections of Q gluconate (1, 3, 9, 18 mg/kg cumulative doses) at 30 min intervals, Q plasma concentration (Cp) ranged from 1.02 +/- 0.1 micrograms/ml to 5.7 +/- 0.6 micrograms at the time of electrophysiologic measurements 20 min after each injection. 2. In six control dogs, heart rate (HR), sinus node recovery time (TRS), conduction times (StH, HV, QRS), ventricular repolarization time (QTc) Wenckebach cycle length (L.W), and atrial refractory periods (RP) did not change significantly while the functional nodal (PRFN) and the effective ventricular (PREV) RPs significantly increased with time. 3. Quinidine produced a significant log- Cp related decrease in HR and increase in TRS corresponding to a decreased sinus automaticity. 4. StH and HV conduction times increased proportionally to log CpQ while the increase in QRS was not Cp-dependent. QTc did not increase significantly. 5. Quinidine resulted in significant log Cp-related increases in atrial RP PRFN and LW while the Q-induced changes in PREV were not Cp-dependent.", "Beta-MHC and SMLC1 transgene induction in overloaded skeletal muscle of transgenic mice.\nThe hypertrophic responses of white fast-twitch muscle to mechanical overload has been investigated using transgenic mice. After 7 wk of overload, endogenous beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC) and slow myosin light chain 1 and 2 (SMLC1, SMLC2) protein were increased in the overloaded plantaris (OP) muscle compared with sham-operated control plantaris (CP)muscle. Concurrently, the levels of endogenous beta-MHC, SMLC1, SMLC2, and cardiac/slow troponin C (CTnC) mRNA transcripts were significantly increased in OP muscles, whereas skeletal troponin C (sTnC) mRNA transcript levels decreased. As an initial attempt to locate DNA sequence(s) that governs beta-MHC induction in response to mechanical overload, multiple independent transgenic lines harboring four different human beta-MHC transgenes (beta 1286, beta 988, beta 450, beta 141) were generated. Except for transgene beta 141, muscle-specific expression and induction (3- to 22-fold) in OP muscles were observed by measuring chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity (CAT assay). Induction of a SMLC1 transgene (3920SMLC1) in OP muscles was also observed. Collectively, these in vivo data provide evidence that 1) a mechanical overload inducible element(s) is located between nucleotides -450 and +120 of the human beta-MHC transgene, 2) 3,900 bp of 5' sequence is sufficient to confer mechanical overload induction of a SMLC1 transgene, and 3) the increased expression of slow/type I isomyosin (beta-MHC, SMLC1, SMLC2) in response to mechanical overload is regulated, in part, transcriptionally.", "Chronic administration of a selective dopamine D-2 agonist: factors determining behavioral tolerance and sensitization.\nThe locomotor stimulant effects of sustained administration of a potent and selective dopamine (DA) D-2 receptor agonist, [+]-4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine (PHNO), in rats were assessed 24 h a day during 12 h light-dark cycles. PHNO was administered continuously with subcutaneous implants of Alzet osmotic minipumps (5 micrograms/h), for 12 h a day with modified osmotic minipumps (5 micrograms/h), or by daily injections (15 micrograms, SC). Tolerance was observed to occur only with 24 h continuous infusions and only during the light period. The other treatment regimens produced sensitization of the locomotor response. Daytime tolerance to continuous infusions of PHNO was reversed following reversal of the light-dark cycle. A normally 'arousing' stimulus also reversed (temporarily) daytime tolerance. The present results indicate that the temporal pattern of administration of DA agonists, the phase of the circadian cycle and environmental stimuli associated with arousal are important determinants of the behavioral consequences of long-term treatment.", "[Acute abdomen as form of presentation of hepatic adenoma].\nWe report the case of a woman aged 33 years old who was admitted with an acute abdomen. She referred oral contraceptives intake. Physical findings were abdominal tenderness, involuntary guarding and right upper quadrant rigidity. The following studies were performed: laboratory tests excluded hydatidosis and amebiasis. Ultrasonography showed a nodular image in the right hepatic lobe and a normal biliary tract. A low-density mass was observed with the computed tomographic scanning. A tomographic guided needle biopsy was informed as normal liver cells. Angiography showed tortuous hepatic arteries. Laparoscopy revealed a solid formation blood was obtained when it was punctured. Laparotomy was indicated. A tumor in the right hepatic lobe was found but a surgeon did not resect the lesion because a congelation biopsy failed to demonstrate tumoral cells. The diagnosis of hepatic adenoma was reached with the definitive biopsy. Our patient had a good evolution with the contraceptives withdrawal and a tomographic scanning one year after surgery showed the almost complete remission of the tumor. Pain as the initial symptom was observed in 12-52% of patients with an hepatic adenoma an audden onset in 33% of them. However this tumor is not frequently considered as a cause of acute abdomen.", "Plasma morphine and glucuronide (M3G and M6G) concentrations in hospice inpatients.\nPlasma morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) concentrations were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in 36 hospice inpatients receiving morphine orally or subcutaneously. The data were analyzed in relation to dose, serum creatinine, serum gamma glutamyl transferase, and presence or absence of opioid-induced adverse effects. There were significant associations (P < 0.05) between plasma morphine, M3G (subcutaneous route only), and M6G concentrations and dose for both routes of administration. The mean dose-corrected plasma morphine concentration for the subcutaneous group was three times that of the oral group, confirming present oral to subcutaneous dose conversion practices. Nineteen patients experienced symptoms attributed to morphine: nausea and vomiting in ten and acute delirium in nine. Serum creatinine was elevated in patients with adverse effects (P = 0.031), as were the dose-corrected plasma M3G (P = 0.029) and M6G (P = 0.043) concentrations. All seven patients with serum creatinine concentrations above the normal range had symptoms attributed to opioid-induced adverse effects. Plasma M3G, M6G, and dose-corrected plasma M3G and M6G concentrations were significantly (P < 0.001) higher in these patients than in those with normal serum creatinine concentrations. The data indicate that accumulation of M3G and M6G may be a causal or aggravating factor in the nausea and vomiting and cognitive function profile of palliative and terminal care patients with significant renal function impairment.", "Use of NIR spectroscopy in the production of modified industrial resins.\nNatural resins are scarcely used, but after appropriate modification processes they acquire characteristics of viscosity, point of softening, stability, etc. that facilitate their application in fields such as paintings, varnishes, cosmetic, etc. The complexity of resins makes it very difficult to monitor the reactions involved in their modification, the extent of which is usually determined via more experimentally accessible parameters. However, the methods typically used to determine such parameters are slow and produce environmentally unfriendly waste. In this work, we assessed the potential of NIR spectroscopy, as an alternative to the traditional analytical methods, for monitoring the industrial processes involved in the production of modified resins. To this end, we developed PLS calibration models that were used to quantify physical (viscosity and cloud point) and chemical parameters (acid and hydroxyl numbers), with a view to characterize the evolution of the resins during the reaction that take place throughout the fabrication process. Samples were withdrawn at different times stages of the process for analysis with the proposed quantitation models; the data thus obtained were compared with those provided by reference methods. Based on the results, NIR spectroscopy is an effective choice for the accurate, expeditious monitoring of industrial resin modification processes.", "Dynamic MRI of meningiomas and schwannomas: is differential diagnosis possible?\nWe studied 23 patients with meningiomas and 14 with schwannomas using dynamic spin-echo (TR/TE 200/15 ms) MRI. Histologically the meningiomas were classified according to the 1993 WHO classification. Serial images were obtained every 30s for 210s after rapid injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine (0.1 mmol/kg). The contrast-enhancement ratio (CER) was divided into three patterns; a sharp rise with a peak within 60 s (A), a relatively rapid increase with a peak between 60 and 210s (B), a slow increase without a peak (C). The patterns were correlated with the histology of the tumors. The signal intensities of the tumours on T2-weighted images were also analyzed and correlated with the dynamic patterns. Meningiomas had more varied dynamic patterns than schwannomas. Almost half of the meningiomas showed pattern A, and one third pattern C. Of six meningiothelial meningiomas showed pattern A; all schwannomas and fibrous meningiomas showed pattern C. Various patterns were observed in transitional meningiomas. Of the 8 meningiomas showing pattern C, only one gave high signal on T2-weighted images, and could not be differentiated from the schwannomas. Thus, one third of meningiomas could not be differentiated from schwannomas by the dynamic contrast enhancement alone. However, when this was combined with the signal intensity on T2-weighted images, most meningiomas could be differentiated from schwannomas.", "Teaching medical ethics: Phramongkutklao College of Medicine's model.\nThird-year (first preclinical year) Royal Thai Army (RTA) medical cadets were exposed to a rural community in a community medicine field activity. The poor, kind rural people gave good conditions for student's professional development and empathy. To report a community medicine field work activity for professional development of the RTA medical school. Descriptive analysis on two occasions to evaluate the third-year RTA medical cadets' impressions immediately after the community medicine field activity in a rural area in central Thailand and one year later using baseline scores of cadets' impressions against our institute's objectives. At the end of the field work, 90.9% of the cadets reported they achieved several institute objectives. The four most frequent mentioned were ethical development (70.6%), professionalism (84.3%), human relationship & communication skills (92.2%), and capability to work in the cmmunity (64.7%). Furthermore, RTA medical cadets rated the staff as good role models (51%). The community field work course provided a good environment for the third year medical cadets in building morality and professional development to be good doctors.", "Video assistance reduces complication rate of thoracoscopic sympathicotomy for hyperhidrosis.\nThoracoscopic sympathicotomy has proved successful in the treatment of palmar hyperhidrosis. However, up to 8% of patients experience Horner's syndrome, and about 50% show compensatory sweating. This study evaluates the role of video assistance in thoracoscopic sympathicotomy for primary hyperhidrosis of the upper limb. Six hundred fifty-six thoracoscopic sympathicotomies were performed from below T1 to T4 in 369 patients. Of the operations, 558 were done under direct view (CTS group) and 98, with video assistance (VATS group). Follow-up was complete for 78.3% of patients after a median observation period of 16 years. Dry limbs were immediately achieved in 93% of the CTS group and 98% VATS group (p = 0.98). In the CTS group, Horner's syndrome occurred after 2.2% of all operations and rhinitis in 8.3%. No patient in the VATS group showed any symptom of Homer's triad (p = 0.03 versus CTS group) or rhinitis (p = 0.02 versus CTS group). Compensatory sweating was observed in 66.8% in the CTS group versus 69% in the VATS group (p = 0.73) and gustatory sweating, in 50.4% versus 27.6%, respectively (p = 0.01). In performing thoracoscopic sympathicotomy for excessive upper-limb hyperhidrosis, we observed a significant decrease in the incidence of Horner's syndrome, rhinitis, and gustatory sweating when the procedure was guided by video imaging.", "[Oblique Lumbar Interbody Fusion Combined with Minimally Invasive Percutaneous Posterior Instrumentation for Adult Spinal Deformity].\nMinimally invasive surgery(MIS)for adult spinal deformity(ASD)is aimed at minimizing perioperative and postoperative complications. However, MIS techniques have been reported to result in suboptimal sagittal plane correction or pseudoarthrosis when used for severe deformities. The authors present their early experience with circumferential MIS(cMIS), which involves oblique lumbar interbody fusion(OLIF)with percutaneous pedicle screw(PPS)fixation using a rod cantilever technique to enhance lumbar lordosis(LL)for ASD. Twenty-one thoracolumbar ASD cases in which surgical correction was performed from the lower thoracic spine corresponded to class IIIa in the modified minimally invasive spinal deformity surgery(MISDEF)algorithm. Patients with a rigid curve and prior fusion were excluded. Surgery was performed in 2 stages. During the first stage, OLIF was performed from L1/2 or Th12/L1 to L4/5. After 4 to 7 days, the patients were re-imaged with standing radiography, and the second-stage surgery was performed with L5/S1 posterior lumbar interbody fusion(PLIF)and percutaneous instrumentation from the lower thoracic spine to the pelvis. Radiological deformity correction at 4 weeks and perioperative complications were evaluated. Scatter plots were created for comparison of preoperative and postoperative sagittal spinopelvic parameters. The patients' mean age was 75 years. The mean operative time was 488 min, and the blood loss was 901 mL. Significant improvement in the spinopelvic parameters were found on the preoperative images of the sagittal vertical axis(SVA)(108mm to 33.5 mm), lumbar lordosis(LL)(18\u00b0 to 48\u00b0), pelvic tilt(PT)(31.8\u00b0 to 19.2\u00b0), and Cobb angle(CA)(21.1\u00b0 to 11.9\u00b0). The change from the preoperative to the postoperative sagittal spinopelvic parameters(SVA, PI-LL, and PT)strongly correlated with preoperative values. As cMIS resulted in improvement in spinopelvic parameters and no major complications, this technique could provide a safe and effective strategy to manage ASD even with severe sagittal imbalance.", "Structural characterization of the lipovitellin from the shrimp Macrobrachium borellii.\nIn oviparous species, proteins and lipids are found in the vitellus forming lipoproteins called lipovitellins. They are an important energy source for embryos development and larvae growth and survival. We have previously isolated and partially characterized the sole egg cytosolic lipovitellin from the freshwater shrimp Macrobrachium borellii. It is a native protein of 440 kDa, composed of two subunits of 94 and 112 kDa. In the present work we studied size, shape and structure of M. borellii lipovitellin using electron microscopy, crosslinking reagents, MALDI-TOF, circular dichroism, fluorescence and partial proteolysis. The results showed that lipovitellin has a quasi spherical morphology with an estimated diameter of 18.5+/-3.5 nm. It appears to be composed of two subunits of 94 kDa, and one of 112 kDa. The larger subunit is more susceptible to trypsinolysis, indicating that it is less compactly folded and/or more exposed to the aqueous medium than the 94 kDa subunits. The hetero-trimer is held together by non-covalent interactions. Peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF, produced 42 polypeptides matching to a vitellogenin of a related species (Macrobrachium rosenbergii). Circular dichroism indicated that this protein contains 35.7% alpha-helix, 16.6% beta-sheet and 20% turns. Tryptophan fluorescence emission, at a maximum of 334 nm, indicated that the environment polarity of these aromatic residues is similar to that of other crustacean lipoproteins.", "[The surgical treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts following acute pancreatitis].\nThe tactics and results of the operative treatment of pancreatic cysts, complicating severe destructive pancreatitis in a series of thirteen patients, are discussed. The following operative methods are made use of: marsupialization (1), Yurash (10), cystojejunoanastomosis with Braunova (2). The character and scope of surgical intervention are determined intraoperatively, depending on the anatomical situation faced. In pancreatic cysts operated according to Yurash (cystogastroanastomosis), an original drainage method with two probes introduced nasally is used--one wider into the anastomosis, and a narrower one into the duodenum for feeding. The probes are retained for periods ranging from 9 to 35 days. No relapse of the cysts operated by different methods are registered, with the exception of a female patient undergoing marsupialization. In one case operated according to Yurash where no preoperative preparation is done the outcome is fatal, with the patient dying of hemorrhage on the third postoperative day. All patients are operated within 3 months after the formation of cysts. The preoperative preparation includes Kontrikal, Petphtoruracil, atropine, heparin and antibiotic; in some patients the listed drugs are introduced intraarterially into truncus celiacus. A number of inferences are reached and recommendations made: 1. Waiting for the generally accepted 3-month term is unnecessary. 2. In cysts involving the head of the pancreas, tightly adherent to the posterior wall of the stomach, the method of Yurash with the modification suggested for probing should be given preference. 3. In cysts of the body region and tail cystojejunoanastomosis with Braunova is practicable. 4. Proceeding with the preoperative medication in the postoperative period is advisable.", "A de novo PABPN1 germline mutation in a patient with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.\nOculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset autosomal dominantly inherited disorder characterized by dysphagia, ptosis, and proximal limb weakness and is caused by germline mutations (triplet repeat expansions) in the polyadenylate binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene. To describe a 70-year-old female patient with OPMD on the clinical and molecular genetic level and to develop a rapid and efficient molecular genetic screening method to study large patient groups. Detailed family history and clinical assessment of the OPMD patient were followed by mutation analysis of the PABPN1 gene by direct DNA sequencing and by our newly developed method, fluorescent PABPN1 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product (flPPP) method. A cohort of 50 healthy Swiss probands was screened using the flPPP to assess the frequency of the (GCG)7 allele in the Swiss population. Cricopharyngeal myotomy was performed as treatment for dysphagia. A heterozygous (GCG)9 triplet repeat expansion in PABPN1 was identified. Since the family history proved to be negative, the mutation is likely to have occurred de novo. The frequency of the (GCG)7 allele among healthy Swiss controls amounted to 1%. The flPPP method showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Two years after cricopharyngeal myotomy, the patient is still relieved of dysphagia. An otolaryngologist should include OPMD in the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with dysphagia, as this symptom can be the first sign of the disease and family history can be negative. Molecular genetic testing represents a highly accurate and rapid way to confirm the clinical diagnosis of OPMD. Cricopharyngeal myotomy relieves the patient of dysphagia in the majority of cases.", "Long-Term Outcome of Punctate Inner Choroidopathy or Multifocal Choroiditis with Active Choroidal Neovascularization Managed with Intravitreal Bevacizumab.\nTo evaluate the long-term outcome of active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC) or multifocal choroiditis (MFC) after intravitreal bevacizumab treatment. Retrospective study of consecutive patients of PIC/MFC complicated with active CNV. Outcome measures included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), total number of intravitreal injections of bevacizumab and recurrence of CNV. Correlation analysis was performed to find the correlation of various clinical factors and final BCVA. There were 23 eyes in 22 patients with a mean age of 33.22 years included in this study. The mean duration of follow-up was 6.48 years. Improvement of BCVA was noted through the first 3 years and at the final follow-up. BCVA at 1, 6, 12 months and recurrence of CNV were correlated with final BCVA. Most patients of PIC/MFC complicated with CNV managed with intravitreal bevacizumab had improved BCVA over 4 years.", "Risk of Breast Cancer in Patients with Thyroid Cancer Receiving or Not Receiving 131I Treatment: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study.\nAn increased risk of second primary malignancy after (131)I therapy has been reported. The objective of this study was to determine the risk of breast cancer in patients with thyroid cancer receiving or not receiving radioiodine treatment in Taiwan. This nationwide population-based cohort study was conducted using data obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database from 2000 to 2011. A total of 10,361 female patients with thyroid cancer (3,292 did not receive (131)I treatment and 7,069 received (131)I treatment) were enrolled, and 41,444 female controls were frequency-matched to the thyroid cancer patients in a 1:4 ratio by age (5-y age group). A Cox proportional hazards model was applied to estimate the risk of breast cancer in thyroid cancer patients receiving or not receiving (131)I treatment in terms of hazard ratios and 95% and 98% confidence intervals. The incidence rates of breast cancer in patients with thyroid cancer receiving (131)I therapy, those not receiving (131)I therapy, and controls were 18.9, 17.7, and 13.1 per 10,000 person-years, respectively. Compared with patients with thyroid cancer treated with a cumulative (131)I dose of 4.44 GBq or less, the risk of breast cancer was not significantly increased in those treated with a cumulative (131)I dose of more than 4.44 GBq (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-1.21, P = 0.26; 98% confidence interval, 0.45-1.33, P > 0.02). The greatest increased risk of breast cancer in patients with thyroid cancer is associated with the fact that the patient has thyroid cancer regardless of (131)I administration. However, (131)I further increased that risk but not as much as just having thyroid cancer.", "Type II Natural Killer T Cells that Recognize Sterol Carrier Protein 2 Are Implicated in Vascular Inflammation in the Rat Model of Systemic Connective Tissue Diseases.\nWe previously generated a rat model that developed systemic connective tissue diseases, including synovitis, myositis, and small-vessel vasculitis (SVV), and established a vascular endothelial cell-reactive T-cell clone, VASC-1, from the model. VASC-1 was determined to be a type II natural killer T-cell clone. In this study, we attempted to identify the antigen recognized by VASC-1. The monkey-derived cell line COS-7 was used because VASC-1 does not bind naturally to COS-7, although the amino acid sequences are well conserved between monkey CD1d and rat CD1d. We generated 98 COS-7 clones transfected with miscellaneous rat cDNA and screened them for VASC-1 binding. Consequently, we found one clone, 4D2, which could bind to VASC-1. Sequencing identified the rat cDNA introduced into 4D2 as sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2). When VASC-1 was co-cultured with SCP2 knockdown rat vascular endothelial cells, VASC-1 binding was reduced significantly. Moreover, we designed a series of rat SCP2 peptides and introduced them into COS-7 cells. On the basis of VASC-1 binding and proliferation, we revealed that the peptide rSCP2518-532 included the epitope recognized by VASC-1. Furthermore, immunization with rSCP2518-532 accelerated the development of SVV in the rat model. The collective findings suggest that type II natural killer T cells reactive with autologous SCP2 are implicated in vascular inflammation in the rat model.", "Providing Mothers with a Pedometer and Subsequent Effect on the Physical Activity of Their Children: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Children with Obesity.\nBackground: Obesity continues to rise, particularly among children, and is one of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century. Physical activity may reduce weight and increase well-being. A pedometer study from the United States, Australia, and Sweden showed that boys need to walk 15,000 steps/day, and girls 12,000 steps/day to maintain a healthy profile. Research shows children with obesity have limited physical activity and they may need parent support to increase their physical activity level. Objective: The aim of this randomized controlled study was to estimate the effect of mothers using pedometers on their children's daily number of steps. Methods: Children/adolescents aged 6-16 years were included and all of them received a pedometer and a step diary. In the intervention group, their mothers received pedometers but not so in the control group. Fifty children were randomized and 32 could be followed-up for 24 weeks. There was no difference in outcome between groups in intention to treat analysis. A complete case analysis showed that the intervention group increased their daily steps (2400, 95% confidence interval 430-4500) compared with the control group (p = 0.019). Conclusions: Involving and activating mothers may increase the children and adolescent's physical activity if implemented more successfully than was done in this study.", "Relative quantity judgments in the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) and the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus).\nNumerous studies have documented the ability of many species to make relative quantity judgments using an analogue magnitude system. We investigated whether one beluga whale, Delphinapterus leucas, and three bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, were capable of selecting the larger of two sets of quantities, and analyzed if their performance matched predictions from the object file model versus the analog accumulator model. In Experiment 1, the two sets were presented simultaneously, under water, and they were visually (condition 1) or echoically (condition 2) available at the time of choice. In experiment 2, the two sets were presented above the water, successively (condition 1) or sequentially, item-by-item (condition 2), so that they were not visually available at the time of choice (condition 1) or at any time throughout the experiment (condition 2). We analyzed the effect of the ratio between quantities, the difference between quantities, and the total number of items presented on the subjects' choices. All subjects selected the larger of the two sets of quantities above chance levels in all conditions. However, unlike most previous studies, the subjects' choices did not match the predictions from the accumulator model. Whether these findings reflect interspecies differences in the mechanisms which underpin relative quantity judgments remains to be determined.", "Factors predicting survival in patients with early stage laryngeal cancer: A cohort study between 2000 to 2015.\nIn recent years, trends of treatment and survival of laryngeal cancer have received heightened attention. Despite the fact that most laryngeal cancers are diagnosed at early stage, a concern of worsening survival in patients with localized cancer has been raised but not consistently observed. This study aimed to determine factors affecting laryngeal cancer survival. This was a cohort study from 2000 to 2015 in which clinical and demographic characteristics of patients at early stage of laryngeal cancer were collected. Medical records and telephone interviews were used to define patient's demographic and clinical status during the study period. Multivariate Cox model was used as the main method for analyzing data. Age at diagnosis, type of treatment, stage, and tumor grade were statistically associated with patient survival. Older patients were more prone to worse prognosis (HR=1.69, 95% CI: 1.03-2.75, p=0.03). The results also suggested that people who had surgery compared with those who received only radiation therapy (RT) survived longer (HR=0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.94, p=0.03). Furthermore, for those whose tumor was grade 3 at diagnosis, the risk of death was 2.45-fold higher than those with grade 1 (HR =2.45, 95% CI: 1.19-5.40, p=0.01). Stage II patients experienced worse prognosis than stage I patients (HR=1.77, 95% CI: 1.06-2.93, p=0.02). This study revealed several factors that can influence patient survival rate, among them different therapeutic approaches.", "Attenuation of breast tumor cell growth by conjugated linoleic acid via inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase activating protein.\nConjugated linoleic acid (CLA) consists of a group of linoleic acid geometric isomers that have been shown to reduce tumor growth and metastasis in animal models of breast, prostate and colon cancer. To delineate a possible mechanism of action for CLA, we have recently shown that the 5-lipoxygenase product, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), could play a role in CLA alteration of mammary tumorigenesis. In this study, we determined how CLA could modulate 5-lipoxygenase activity. The t10, c12-CLA isomer reduced production of 5-HETE but not 12- and 15-HETE in MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor cells. That isomer and the c9, t11-CLA isomer decreased 5-HETE production by competition with the lipoxygenase substrate, arachidonic acid (AA). Interestingly, t10, c12-CLA reduced the expression of five-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) but not the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme. Over-expression of FLAP abrogated t10, c12-CLA-reduced viability of MDA-MB-231 cells. These data suggest that the reduction of 5-HETE by t10, c12-CLA was due to competition with AA and the reduction of FLAP expression.", "Abiotic stresses activate a MAPkinase in the model grass species Lolium temulentum.\nForage and turf grasses are utilized in diverse environments that expose them to a variety of abiotic stresses, however very little is known concerning the perception or molecular responses to these various stresses. In the model grass species Lolium temulentum, a 46kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was activated in the leaf within 10min of exposing the roots to salt stress. When plants were subjected cold stress, no significant activation of the MAPK was observed. However, the 46kDa MAPK was rapidly activated in the leaves of plants within 3min of exposure to heat stress. Previously, mechanical wounding has been shown to rapidly activate a 46kDa and a 44kDa MAPK in L. temulentum. The wound activation of the MAPKs was delayed and diminished in plants undergoing cold treatment. In plants subjected simultaneously to 40\u00b0C and wounding, the activation of the 46kDa MAPK was enhanced. However if plants were subjected to heat and cold stress for more than 2h or exposed to 300mM NaCl for 24h prior to wounding, the wound activation of the 46kDa and a 44kDa MAPKs were significantly inhibited. These results suggest that the 46kDa MAPK plays a role in the response to various environmental stimuli.", "Evolution of control of epithelial transport in vertebrates.\nIn this review, the control of osmoregulation in the whole animal is discussed. Two main areas are considered: (i) the interaction between neural and hormonal control of osmoregulation and (ii) the relationship between vascular and osmoregulatory responses to these controlling factors. In the first area, the importance of neural influence on bullfrog kidney is described. The data suggest that alpha-adrenergic mechanisms are involved in glomerular as well as tubular functions. Innervation of tubular cels is seen in electron microscopic studies. Effects of neurotransmitters on fish gills and amphibian urinary bladder and skin transport are discussed. It is suggested that neural control in fish and amphibian epithelial transport might play an important role in osmoregulation. In the second area, a hypothesis is advanced for the evolution of renal function of arginine vasotocin (AVT). AVT probably first appeared as a vascular hormone. Its diuretic effect on fishes could be due to its systemic pressor action. During evolution, redistribution of vascular receptors, which became more numerous or more sensitive in the preglomerular circulation, resulted in glomerular antidiuresis as seen in the mudpuppy and bullfrog. Tubular receptors to AVT, present in the bullfrog, enhanced the antidiuretic property of this peptide. Effects of neurotransmitters on gill transport could be due in part to their vascular action on the branchial vasculature. The intimate relationship between vascular and osmoregulatory responses to controlling factors could be important in our understanding of the evolution of the control of osmoregulation.", "The pab1 gene of Coprinus cinereus encodes a bifunctional protein for para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) synthesis: implications for the evolution of fused PABA synthases.\nThe pab1 gene of the basidiomycete Coprinus cinereus encodes PABA synthase, necessary for para-aminobenzoic acid production. The C. cinereus protein is bifunctional with an N-terminal glutamine amidotransferase domain and a C-terminal chorismate amination domain. In most bacteria, these two functions are encoded in separate genes (e.g., pabA and pabB of E. coli). Fused PABA synthases have so far been detected in actinomycetes, Plasmodium falciparum, fungi and Arabidopsis thaliana. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the fused PAB sequences form a tight group that also includes uncharacterized PabB homologues from several bacteria. Unfused bacterial PabA proteins group with the glutamine amidotransferase subunits of bacterial anthranilate synthases, independent of organismal systematics, indicating a complex and perhaps independent evolutionary origin. In contrast, unfused PabB group and fused PabA/B proteins form a monophyletic group on a branch separate from the chorismate amination subunits of anthranilate synthases, probably reflecting a need for recognition of different positions in the common substrate chorismate.", "Preliminary evidence of anxiolytic effects of the CRF(1) receptor antagonist R317573 in the 7.5% CO(2) proof-of-concept experimental model of human anxiety.\nWe have validated the use of prolonged inhalation of 7.5% carbon dioxide (CO(2)) as a human model of anxiety and have shown that drugs from two prototypical classes of anxiolytics, benzodiazepines and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, attenuate CO(2)-induced symptoms (Bailey et al., 2007a). Preclinical evidence suggests that drugs acting at the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system may be useful for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and other stress-related disorders (Valdez, 2006), hence we have now examined the effects of a CRF(1) receptor antagonist in the 7.5% CO(2) model. In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, study in 32 healthy participants we examined the effects of 7 days of treatment with the CRF(1) receptor antagonist, R317573, at a dose that shows a favourable safety profile and is comparable with those effective in preclinical models (40 mg). On day 8, eight of the placebo-treated group received lorazepam (LZP) 2 mg as a positive control. All participants underwent 20 min inhalation of 7.5% CO(2)-enriched air. Subjective reports of peak gas effects were assessed using visual analogue scales and questionnaires. The mean age of participants was 26 years, and 13 were male. The peak effects of CO(2) were expressed as a difference from baseline scores obtained while breathing air alone. Compared with placebo (PLAC), both drug groups showed a decrease in all subjective symptoms, total score on the panic symptom inventory (CRF 11 [2.6], PLAC 16.4 [3.1], LZP 2.9 [3.0]) and a generalized anxiety disorder symptom scale (CRF 2.2 [1.5], PLAC 8.2 [2.2], LZP 1.1 [1.5]). We have shown that a drug that acts to inhibit the CRF(1) receptor shows efficacy in the 7.5% CO(2) model of anxiety in healthy participants.", "A biomimetic tongue by photoluminescent metal-organic frameworks.\nThe taste sensing capabilities of a \"biomimetic tongue\" based on the photoluminescence (PL) responses of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), [In(OH)(bdc)]n (bdc=1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), [Tb(btc)]n (MOF-76, btc=benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate), and [Ca3(btc)2(DMF)2(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O are proven on aqueous solutions of five basic tastants: sucrose (sweet), caffeine (bitter), citric acid (sour), sodium chloride (salty) and monosodium glutamate (umami). For [In(OH)(bdc)]n, the tastant interacts stereochemically with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and alters its conformations. The frequency and magnitude of chelation between COO(-) pendant groups of PAA and In(3+) nodes of [In(OH)(bdc)]n framework influence the corresponding PL reponses. For MOF-76, the tastant interacts with incorporated water in MOF-76 through hydrogen bonding. The limitation of O-H bond stretching of water results in the enhancement of the PL intensity. For [Ca3(BTC)2(DMF)2(H2O)2]\u00b73H2O, it is added as a third MOF component to increase the precision on taste discrimination. The significance of MOF-based \"biomimetic tongue\" includes: (1) PAA on [In(OH)(bdc)]n mimics the taste receptor cells (TRCs) for their structural flexibility, (2) the Weber-Fechner law of human sensing that sensation is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity is observed between the PL emission response of MOF-76 and the concentration of tastant, (3) the strength of taste is quantified by the \u03c4 scale and the PL emission intensity of MOF-76, which are dependent on the logarithmic tastant concentration, (4) the tastant is identified by the shape of the 3D principal component analysis contour map (i.e., pattern recognition method), and (5) the fabrication of [In(OH)(bdc)]n/PAA film by brushing is illustrated.", "6 pcs Capitano\u00c2\u00ae standard 30\" high quality fiberglass arrows with Replaceable Screw-in Tips for recurve, long, or compound (except for all-capture arrow rests) bows. *** Tips on choosing specific length of arrow for your bow: there shall be one inch of the arrow outside the most forward portion of the arrow rest when your bow is drawn at its full position.

Overcoming the species difference between guinea pig and man.\nRecently we reported the identification of a series of 8-[[3-(N-acylglycyl-N-methylamino)-2, 6-dichlorobenzyl]oxy]-3-halo-2-methylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridines as the first orally active non-peptide bradykinin (BK) B2 receptor antagonists (1-3). These compounds inhibited the specific binding of [3H]BK to guinea pig ileum membrane preparations expressing B2 receptors with nanomolar IC50's and also displayed in vivo functional antagonistic activities against BK-induced bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs at 1 mg/kg by oral administration. However, it was found that their affinities for the B2 receptors in human A-431 cells (human epidermoid carcinoma) were much lower. Intensive modifications of the terminal substituents at the glycine moiety elucidated the structure-activity relationships (SAR) for human B2 receptors, leading to an extended basic framework which incorporated a novel key pharmacophore. Thus, we overcame the species difference and identified the first clinical candidate 18c (FR167344) with IC50's of 0.66 and 1.4 nM for guinea pig ileum and human A-431 cells, respectively. This compound displayed in vivo functional antagonistic activity against BK-induced bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs with an ED50 value of 0.17 mg/kg by oral administration. This novel non-peptide B2 antagonist is extremely potent both in vitro and in vivo by oral administration and is expected to be the first member of a new class of drug for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases.", "Learning and development in neural networks--the importance of prior experience.\nInfants can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar grammatical patterns expressed in a vocabulary that is distinct from that used earlier during familiarization (Cognition 70(2) (1999) 109; Science 283 (1999) 77). Various models have captured the data, although each required that discrimination be distinct, in terms of the computational process, from familiarization. This article describes a simple recurrent network (SRN), equipped only with the assumption that it should predict what comes next, which models the data without distinguishing between familiarization and discrimination. To accomplish this, the SRN requires pre-training on a range of sequences instantiating different structures and different vocabulary items to those used subsequently during familiarization and test. Pre-training enables the network to avoid replacing structure acquired during familiarization with structure experienced at test. An equivalent enabling condition may underpin infants' resistance to catastrophic interference between the different structures and vocabulary items to which they are exposed.", "Lentiviral transduction of human dendritic cells.\nDendritic cells (DCs) are potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that play a pivotal role in stimulating antigen-specific T cells in vivo. The cardinal properties of DCs are: the ability to take up, process, and present antigens; (2) the ability to migrate through different tissues into lymphoid organs; and (3) the ability to interact with and stimulate T cells (3). Because of their unique capability of generating primary CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, DCs are of particular interest for immunotherapeutic approaches to infectious disease and cancer. There are many ways to load DCs with antigen and to subsequently induce specific immune responses in vivo and in vitro. One strategy relies on genetically modified peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived DCs to establish expression of a gene that encodes a specific antigen. In contrast to pulsing DCs with antigenic peptides or proteins, genetic engineering of DCs has the advantages of providing multiple epitopes for major histocompatibility class (MHC) class I-and MHC class II-restricted immune responses as well as a continuous supply of antigen for presentation alone or together with immunomodulatory proteins (cytokines, for example).", "Adherence of triamcinolone acetonide to various intraocular lens materials.\nTo determine the adherence of triamcinolone acetonide to various intraocular lens (IOL) materials. Department of Ophthalmology, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University, Izmir, Turkey. Four IOLs of 4 materials (single-piece poly(methyl methacrylate) [PMMA], 3-piece foldable silicone, 3-piece hydrophobic acrylic, and single-piece hydrophilic acrylic) were first immersed in triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg/mL) for 15 minutes and then bathed in a balanced salt solution for another 15 minutes. Afterward, each lens optic was examined under light microscopy and digital images were obtained with a digital color video camera. The percentage of optic area covered with triamcinolone acetonide was determined by image analysis. Mean triamcinolone coverage was 7.62% +/- 4.06% (SD) for PMMA IOLs (range 1.97% to 11.43%), 9.09% +/- 4.60% for silicone IOLs (range 4.70% to 15.32%), 8.75 +/- 7.20% for hydrophobic acrylic IOLs (range 1.31% to 16.86%), and 23.16 +/- 8.53% for hydrophilic acrylic IOLs (range 15.02% to 35.12%). Adherence of triamcinolone acetonide to hydrophilic acrylic lenses was statistically significant when compared with other IOL materials. Intraoperative triamcinolone injection may obscure visualization intraoperatively and postoperatively, especially in eyes with hydrophilic acrylic lenses, because triamcinolone acetonide seems to have a tendency to adhere to hydrophilic acrylic lenses in vitro.", "Steroids and miRNAs in assessment of ovarian tissue damage following cryopreservation.\nOvarian cortical tissue cryopreservation is a relatively novel approach to preserving fertility in women diagnosed with cancer. However, the effects of freezing-thawing are not fully understood, mainly due to the lack of suitable methods to assess tissue's survival after thawing. Disparities in steroid production have been associated with ovarian failure by disrupting folliculogenesis, ovulation and oocyte apoptosis. Moreover, specific microRNAs, identified in human ovarian follicles, are thought to play a fundamental role in folliculogenesis. In this study, we investigated the possible interplay between the ovarian steroidal production and microRNA expression patterns in spent culture media, as potential non-invasive markers for ovarian tissue damage after cryopreservation. Cryopreservation of ovarian cortical tissue decreased (P<0.05) both steroid production (oestradiol and progesterone) and expression of microRNA-193b and 320A in spent culture media over 5 days, however, expression of microRNA-24 increased (P<0.05). The number of primordial follicles were also reduced (P<0.05) in fresh-cultured and cryopreserved-cultured cortical tissues when compared with fresh tissues. Downregulation of microRNA-193b and microRNA-320A together with upregulation of microRNA-24 could have a synergistic role in cell apoptosis, and consequently leading to reduced oestradiol and progesterone production. Thus, there appears to be an interplay between these microRNAs, ovarian steroid production and cell damage, which can be further explored as novel non-invasive markers of cell damage following cryopreservation.", "Effects of triphenyltin acetate on survival, hatching success, and liver ultrastructure of early life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio).\nIn order to evaluate the toxicity of the fungicide triphenyltin acetate (TPTA) on hatching, survival, morphology, and histology of early life stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio), newly fertilized eggs were exposed to concentrations of 0.5, 5, 25, 75, and 100 microg/liter TPTA for 96 h at 28+/-0.5 degrees C. Embryos and larvae were kept under constant observation for up to 7 days and studied with respect to mortality and teratogenic effects as well as histological and cytological alterations in the liver as endpoints of sublethal toxicity of TPTA. Exposure to TPTA caused dose- and time-related effects with respect to all parameters investigated: (1) Hatching was delayed at concentrations >/=0.5 microg/liter TPTA; (2) mortality increased at >/=25 microg/liter TA after 96 h exposure, with TPTA toxicity being higher in larval than in embryonic stages; (3) from >/=25 microg/liter, larvae exhibited skeletal malformation, retarded yolk sac resorption, and edema in the heart and yolk sac regions; and (4) histo- and cytopathological alterations of larval liver included changes in nuclei and mitochondria as well as glycogen depletion from >/=0.5 microg/liter TPTA. The study thus demonstrates not only an elevated sensitivity of zebrafish embryos to TPTA in stages prior to hatching, but also the importance of continuous observation over extended periods after termination of the actual exposure for a comprehensive evaluation of the toxicity of chemical compounds.", "Interleukin-1 beta increases activity of human endothelial progenitor cells: involvement of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.\nInterleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) is a multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine upregulated in acute phase of heart ischemic disease. Controversial effects of IL-1\u03b2 have been demonstrated on endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) functional activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro effect of IL-1\u03b2 on activity of human origin EPCs and the possible mechanism involved. EPCs were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers without cardiovascular risk factors and characterized. After ex vivo cultivation, EPCs were stimulated with a series of final concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, and 10 ng/ml) of IL-1\u03b2 for 24 h. In some other experiments, EPCs were pretreated with 10 \u03bcM LY294002 (Akt inhibitor) for 30 min and then stimulated with 1 ng/ml IL-1\u03b2 for 24 h. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, and migration were determined, respectively, by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, annexin V/propidium iodide binding assay, adhesion assay, and transwell migration assay. In addition, the vascular endothelial vascular growth factor-A (VEGF-A) production has been examined using quantitative real-time RT-PCR and ELISA assay. Furthermore, the total and phosphorylation level of Akt was determined by Western blot. IL-1\u03b2 significantly stimulated EPC proliferation, migration, and adhesion and upregulated the angiogenic growth factor VEGF-A at mRNA and protein level, while exerted no influence on cell apoptosis. However, pretreatment with LY294002 significantly diminished IL-1\u03b2-induced proliferation, migration, adhesion, and VEGF-A production. One nanogram per milliliter IL-1\u03b2 for 15 min activated phosphorylation of Akt. These results suggest a potent role for IL-1\u03b2 in upregulating EPCs functions. The phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway could be involved in the regulation of EPCs functions induced by IL-1\u03b2.", "Introduction to the focus issue: chemo-hydrodynamic patterns and instabilities.\nPattern forming instabilities are often encountered in a wide variety of natural phenomena and technological applications, from self-organization in biological and chemical systems to oceanic or atmospheric circulation and heat and mass transport processes in engineering systems. Spatio-temporal structures are ubiquitous in hydrodynamics where numerous different convective instabilities generate pattern formation and complex spatiotemporal dynamics, which have been much studied both theoretically and experimentally. In parallel, reaction-diffusion processes provide another large family of pattern forming instabilities and spatio-temporal structures which have been analyzed for several decades. At the intersection of these two fields, \"chemo-hydrodynamic patterns and instabilities\" resulting from the coupling of hydrodynamic and reaction-diffusion processes have been less studied. The exploration of the new instability and symmetry-breaking scenarios emerging from the interplay between chemical reactions, diffusion and convective motions is a burgeoning field in which numerous exciting problems have emerged during the last few years. These problems range from fingering instabilities of chemical fronts and reactive fluid-fluid interfaces to the dynamics of reaction-diffusion systems in the presence of chaotic mixing. The questions to be addressed are at the interface of hydrodynamics, chemistry, engineering or environmental sciences to name a few and, as a consequence, they have started to draw the attention of several communities including both the nonlinear chemical dynamics and hydrodynamics communities. The collection of papers gathered in this Focus Issue sheds new light on a wide range of phenomena in the general area of chemo-hydrodynamic patterns and instabilities. It also serves as an overview of the current research and state-of-the-art in the field.", "Application of photochemical cross-linking to the study of oligomerization of amyloidogenic proteins.\nAssembly of amyloidogenic proteins into toxic oligomers and fibrils is an important pathogenic feature of over 30 amyloid-related diseases. Understanding the structures and mechanisms involved in the assembly process is necessary for rational approaches geared at inhibiting formation of these toxic species. Here, we review the application of photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) to two disease-related amyloidogenic proteins (1) islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), whose toxic oligomers are thought to cause the demise of pancreatic \u03b2-cells in type-2 diabetes mellitus and (2) \u03b1-synuclein, which aggregates into toxic oligomers and precipitates in Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease. PICUP is an effective method allowing chemical \"freezing\" of dynamically changing oligomers and subsequent study of the oligomer size distribution that existed before cross-linking. The method has provided insights into the factors controlling early oligomerization, which could not be obtained by other means. We discuss sample preparation, experimental details, optimization of parameters, and troubleshooting.", "Nosocomial outbreak of influenza virus A (H3N2) infection in a solid organ transplant department.\nThere is a strong body of evidence in favor of influenza virus immunization in solid organ recipients. However, little attention has been devoted to other reservoirs, such as the patients' relatives and, at the time of hospital admission, to the healthcare workers. Analysis of the epidemiology of an outbreak of nosocomial influenza A in a solid organ transplant unit. Four cases of influenza A virus infection were reported during a short 4-day outbreak in a 12 single-room transplant unit. None of the patients had been immunized against influenza. Three patients had not been visited by their relatives between admission and influenza infection. Three nurses, among the 27 healthcare workers, presented with clinical flu symptoms at times consistent with nosocomial transmission. Because the prevention of influenza infection by vaccination warrants a global strategy to target the different reservoirs, we suggest that the modern policy of vaccinating solid organ patients should be extended both to their relatives and to the healthcare workers of transplant units.", "Effect of low temperature on ethanolic fermentation in rice seedlings.\nRice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.) were incubated at 5-30 degrees C for 48 h and the effect of temperature on ethanolic fermentation in the seedlings was investigated in terms of low-temperature adaptation. Activities of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, EC 1.1.1.1) and pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC, EC 4.1.1.1) in roots and shoots of the seedlings were low at temperatures of 20-30 degrees C, whereas temperatures of 5, 7.5 and 10 degrees C significantly increased ADH and PDC activities in the roots and shoots. Temperatures of 5-10 degrees C also increased ethanol concentrations in the roots and shoots. The ethanol concentrations in the roots and shoots at 7.5 degrees C were 16- and 12-times greater than those in the roots and shoots at 25 degrees C, respectively. These results indicate that low temperatures (5-10 degrees C) induced ethanolic fermentation in the roots and shoots of the seedlings. Ethanol is known to prevent lipid degradation in plant membrane, and increased membrane-lipid fluidization. In addition, an ADH inhibitor, 4-methylpyrazole, decreased low-temperature tolerance in roots and shoots of rice seedlings and this reduction in the tolerance was recovered by exogenous applied ethanol. Therefore, production of ethanol by ethanolic fermentation may lead to low-temperature adaptation in rice plants by altering the physical properties of membrane lipids.", "The hemodynamic simulation of mitral regurgitation in ventricular septal defect after myocardial infarction.\nThe development of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) following myocardial infarction is an uncommon complication which clinically can be confused with mitral insufficiency due to infarction of a papillary muscle. The clinical and hemodynamic records of six patients with documented acute VSD secondary to myocardial infarction were analyzed to determine which descriptors would be of value in clinically separating these two entities. All six of our patients had a right heart catheterization showing an oxygen step-up consistent with a VSD, and five had a large pulmonary wedge V wave suggesting concomitant mitral insufficiency. The echocardiogram showed only nonspecific chamber enlargement. Since these patients were being considered for open heart surgery to close the VSD, left and right cardiac catheterization including selective coronary arteriography was done. Despite large V waves being present in the pulmonary wedge and/or left atrial pressure tracing in five of the six patients, no mitral insufficiency was present on the left ventricular cineangiograms. It is concluded that a large pulmonary wedge and/or left atrial V wave does not necessarily indicate mitral insufficiency. Since both a VSD and mitral insufficiency are surgically correctable, patients who develop new holosystolic murmurs following myocardial infarction should have complete right and left heart catheterizations with LV angiography for accurate diagnosis if surgical correction of the lesion is contemplated.", "GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors inhibit neurotransmission in the mouse striatum through a cholinergic mechanism: implication for Parkinson's disease.\nThe GluN2 subunits that compose NMDA receptors (NMDARs) determine functional and pharmacological properties of the receptor. In the striatum, functions and potential dysfunctions of NMDARs attributed to specific GluN2 subunits have not been clearly elucidated, although NMDARs play critical roles in the interactions between glutamate and dopamine. Through the use of amperometry and field potential recordings in mouse brain slices, we found that NMDARs that contain the GluN2D subunit contribute to NMDA-induced inhibition of evoked dopamine release and of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the striatum of control mice. Inhibition is likely mediated through increased firing in cholinergic interneurons, which were shown to express GluN2D. Indeed, NMDA-induced inhibition of both dopamine release and glutamatergic neurotransmission is reduced in the presence of muscarinic receptor antagonists and is mimicked by a muscarinic receptor agonist. We have also examined whether this function of GluN2D-containing NMDARs is altered in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. We found that the inhibitory role of GluN2D-containing NMDARs on glutamatergic neurotransmission is impaired in the 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned striatum. These results identify a role for GluN2D-containing NMDARs and adaptive changes in experimental Parkinsonism. GluN2D might constitute an attractive target for the development of novel pharmacological tools for therapeutic intervention in Parkinson's disease.", "Remediation of oil spill-contaminated sands by chemical-free microbubbles generated in tap and saline water.\nOil spill-contaminated sands caused by marine oil spillage could severely impact aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In this work, self-collapsing microbubbles (MBs)-based method was explored as a chemical free approach for remediation of oil spill-contaminated sands. Tap water and saline water with 32 g/L of sodium chloride were employed as the media to generate MBs. Results showed that almost all oils were removed from the oil spill-contaminated sands after the 40-min treatment with MBs generated in tap water. The oil removal efficiency of MBs in saline water was slightly lower than that in tap water, while more than 90% of oil removal efficiency was still achieved after the 40-min treatment. The analyses by FTIR and UV spectra further confirmed the oil removal from oil spill-contaminated sands by MBs. Consequently, self-collapsing MBs showed a great potential as an environmentally friendly technology for high-efficiency remediation of oil spill-contaminated sands.", "Rhabdospora thelohani Laguess\u00e9, 1895 (Apicomplexa): new host and geographic records with taxonomic considerations.\nNew fish species and geographic records for Rhabdospora thelohani Laguess\u00e9, 1895 (rodlet cells) are presented. Additionally, the ultrastructure of R. thelohani in Alburnoides bipunctatus ohridanus Karaman, Borostomias antarcticus (L\u00f6nnberg), Leuciscus cephalus albus Bonaparte and Rutilus rubilio (Bonaparte) is compared with that reported by other authors and with members of Subphylum Apicomplexa. The ultrastructure of R. thelohani was similar in all the fish species examined; however, the organism was not present in all members of any single species and had intertissue density variations. Rhabdospora thelohani is pyriform, averaging in size 7 X 12 micrometer, with a basal nucleus. The surface complex is composed of a layer (0.5 micrometer diameter) formed by microfilaments (9.3 nm) and an outer trilaminar membrane (9.3 nm). The cytoplasm contains structures identical to rhoptries, micronemes and subpellicular microtubules. Mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, and rough endoplasmic reticulum were not observed, althouth free ribosomes were present and arranged in a vesicular pattern. The observations suggest that the organism moves between cell of epithelial layers and is either released into a lumen intact or passively or actively discharges its contents into a lumen. Results from this study indicate that R. thelohani should be considered a member of Apicomplexa unless definitive evidence is presented to the contrary.", "Crime scene ethics: souvenirs, teaching material, and artifacts.\nPolice and forensic specialists are ethically obliged to preserve the integrity of their investigations and their agencies' reputations. The American Academy of Forensic Sciences and the Canadian Society of Forensic Science provide no guidelines for crime scene ethics, or the retention of items from former crime scenes. Guidelines are necessary to define acceptable behavior relating to removing, keeping, or selling artifacts, souvenirs, or teaching specimens from former crime scenes, where such activities are not illegal, to prevent potential conflicts of interest and the appearance of impropriety. Proposed guidelines permit the retention of objects with educational value, provided they are not of significance to the case, they are not removed until the scene is released, permission has been obtained from the property owner and police investigator, and the item has no significant monetary value. Permission is necessary even if objects appear discarded, or are not typically regarded as property, e.g., animal bones.", "Current management of peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer.\nApproximately 5% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients will develop peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) in the absence of systemic disease. Iconographic staging is only moderately accurate, but may be improved by diffusion weighted MR imaging. Systemic chemotherapy prolongs survival in PC patients, but is less active than in patients with hepatic metastasis. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy is based mainly on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic observations. An increasing number of patients is treated with cytoreductive surgery followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC). Provided a complete resection can be performed, a median survival of almost three years may be achieved. The combined procedure is, however, associated with potentially significant morbidity. In patients with resected CRC at high risk of peritoneal recurrence, planned repeat surgery with \"prophylactic\". HIPEC has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of peritoneal recurrence. Cytoreduction and HIPEC should be a component of a multimodal approach, including neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapeutic regimens. Several questions remain, such as the specific role of HIPEC versus surgery alone, and the results of ongoing randomized trials are expected to provide important answers.", "A satisfaction survey of opioid-dependent patients with methadone maintenance treatment.\nThe aim of this study was to examine opioid-dependent patients' satisfaction with the methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) program in Malaysia and identify predictors of satisfaction. We used an interviewer-administered questionnaire developed and validated by Rankin Court, New South Wales, Australia. Of 502 patients approached in 11 MMT centers in Malaysia, 425 agreed to participate giving a response rate of 85%. In terms of overall satisfaction, a high percentage of respondents (85%) were satisfied with the MMT services. A logistic regression analysis showed that only \"centres\" and marital status were associated with overall satisfaction and that being single (OR 3.31; 95% CI 1.52 to 7.20) or married (OR 4.06; 95% CI 1.76 to 9.38) was associated with higher odds of overall satisfaction compared to being divorced or separated. An analysis of the responses pertaining to the most desired changes required at the center found dosing hours, waiting area and staff shortages to be common. The findings acquired from this survey will be useful to attain a clearer perspective on what aspects of the MMT service need to be reviewed for the improvement of service delivery.", "Crystal structures of the Met148Leu and Ser86Asp mutants of rusticyanin from Thiobacillus ferrooxidans: insights into the structural relationship with the cupredoxins and the multi copper proteins.\nThe crystal structures of the Met148Leu and Ser86Asp mutants of rusticyanin are presented at 1.82 and 1.65 A resolution, respectively. Both of these structures have two molecules in the asymmetric unit compared to the one present in the crystal form of the native protein. This provides an opportunity to investigate intramolecular electron transfer pathways in rusticyanin. The redox potential of the Met148Leu mutant ( approximately 800 mV) is elevated compared to that of the native protein ( approximately 670 mV at pH 3.2) while that of the Ser86Asp mutant ( approximately 623 mV at pH 3.2) is decreased. The effect of the Ser86Asp mutation on the hydrogen bonding near the type 1 Cu site is discussed and hence its role in determining acid stability is examined. The type 1 Cu site of Met148Leu mimics the structural and biochemical characteristics of those found in domain II of ceruloplasmin and fungal laccase. Moreover, the native rusticyanin's cupredoxin core and the type 1 Cu site closely resemble those found in ascorbate oxidase and nitrite reductase. Structure based phylogenetic trees have been re-examined in view of the additional structural data on rusticyanin and fungal laccase. We confirm that rusticyanin is in the same class as nitrite reductase domain 2, laccase domain 3 and ceruloplasmin domains 2, 4 and 6.", "Hematological and clinical chemistry changes induced by subchronic dosing of a novel phosphorothionate (RPR-V) in Wistar male and female rats.\nA novel phosphorothionate [2-butenoic acid-3-(diethoxy phosphinothioyl)-ethyl ester; RPR-V] synthesized at Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (Hyderabad, India) was studied using subchronic doses of 0.033 (low), 0.066 (medium), and 0.099 (high) mg kg(- 1) in male and female rats daily for 90 days. Continuous treatment with RPR-V caused significant (p < 0.05) decreases in body-weight gain, feed intake, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), and total erythrocyte count (TEC), whereas total leukocyte count (TLC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were increased. Similarly, RPR-V caused significant elevation in serum clinical chemistry parameters calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, and chloride contents, whereas protein and glucose levels were depressed in both male and female treated rats after 45 and 90 days of treatment. These alterations were significant when compared with two-way ANOVA showing that these changes were dose- and time-dependent. The effects of low dose were generally not statistically significant, whereas medium and high doses caused significant effects. The changes in male rats were not significant when compared with female rats showing no sexual dimorphism by this compound. Recovery was observed after 28 days post-treatment (withdrawal study), indicating that the compound entered into the system was eliminated from the body, and the blood parameters were improved. Hematological and clinical chemistry parameters can be detected rapidly and hence can be used for prediction and diagnosis of pesticide toxicity. Alterations in these parameters show toxic stress in the treated animals especially on blood and blood-forming organs.", "Postmortem drug screening by non-targeted and targeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technology.\nIn the medical examiner setting, comprehensive drug screening is an essential analytical tool in the investigation of cause and manner of death.We have validated non-targeted and targeted screening assays for drugs and metabolites using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) interfaced with mass spectrometry (MS) in single and tandem stages. For non-targeted screening by UPLC-MS electrospray interface, in-source fragmentation was used along with MS scanning (m/z 80-650) and library search for over 700 drug and metabolite analytes. Targeted detection of over 200 analytes by UPLC-MS-MS was performed with dual transition ion monitoring. Validation studies confirmed reproducibility of both mass spectra produced by in-source fragmentation and transition ion ratios by collision-cell dissociation. Lower limit of detection by UPLC-MS (10-150 ng/mL) and UPLC-MS-MS (1-50 ng/mL) was determined for a subset of drugs and correlated with extraction recovery and matrix effect. Drug findings by UPLC-MS and UPLC- MS-MS were compared with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) screening in postmortem blood from 410 medical examiner cases with 1121 positive drug findings by all methods. Accuracy, based on results of confirmation testing, was high (98-99%) across all screening assays and detection sensitivity by GC-MS (71%), UPLC-MS (73%), and UPLC-MS-MS (76%) was determined. UPLC-MS plus UPLC-MS-MS screening resulted in the highest drug detection rate (95%) and provided optimal dual-screening for the postmortem casework.", "Magnetic Reduced Graphene Oxide/Nickel/Platinum Nanoparticles Micromotors for Mycotoxin Analysis.\nMagnetic reduced graphene oxide/nickel/platinum nanoparticles (rGO/Ni/PtNPs) micromotors for mycotoxin analysis in food samples were developed for food-safety diagnosis. While the utilization of self-propelled micromotors in bioassays has led to a fundamentally new approach, mainly due to the greatly enhanced target-receptor contacts owing to their continuous movement around the sample and the associated mixing effect, herein the magnetic properties of rGO/Ni/PtNPs micromotors for mycotoxin analysis are additionally explored. The micromotor-based strategy for targeted mycotoxin biosensing focused on the accurate control of micromotor-based operations: 1) on-the-move capture of free aptamers by exploiting the adsorption (outer rGO layer) and catalytic (inner PtNPs layer) properties and 2) micromotor stopped flow in just 2 min by exploiting the magnetic properties (intermediate Ni layer). This strategy allowed fumonisin B1 determination with high sensitivity (limit of detection: 0.70 ng mL-1 ) and excellent accuracy (error: 0.05 % in certified reference material and quantitative recoveries of 104\u00b14 % in beer) even in the presence of concurrent ochratoxin A (105-108\u00b18 % in wines). These results confirm the developed approach as an innovative and reliable analytical tool for food-safety monitoring, and confirm the role of micromotors as a new paradigm in analytical chemistry.", "Aztreonam in the treatment of urinary tract infections: a multicenter trial.\nA multicenter trial involving several urologic units in Italy provided pooled data on 1,427 patients with urinary tract infections to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aztreonam, a new monobactam antibiotic. Microbiologic and clinical data were collected methodically in all cases. A majority of the patients (79.9%) were hospitalized during the study period, an associated pathology was noted in 29.1%, and 16.7% were receiving additional therapy. Aztreonam was administered by different routes and in different dosages according to the severity of the pathology. At the end of treatment, 93.6% of the patients showed a positive microbiologic response. Eradication percentages of the 6 main pathogens determined from cultures taken within the seventh day after the end of treatment were as follows: 93.9% for Escherichia coli (n = 415), 86.3% for Pseudomonas sp. (n = 207), 91.6% for Proteus sp. (n = 192), 89.8% for Providencia sp. (n = 59), 96.2% for Klebsiella sp. (n = 56), and 98.1% for Serratia sp. (n = 56). Aztreonam was well tolerated. Of the 1,427 patients evaluated for safety, only 54 (3.8%) reported 55 adverse reactions, necessitating the withdrawal of therapy in 5 (0.2%) instances.", "Effect of afterload on left ventricular performance in experimental animals. Comparison of the pre-ejection period and other indices of left ventricular contractility.\nAfterload reduction has become a routine treatment of patients with severe heart failure. In order to investigate the effect of afterload changes on indices of left ventricular performance, seven anesthetized dogs were studied. Serial alterations of afterload were produced with sodium nitroprusside and methoxamine infusions while the heart rate was maintained constant with right atrial pacing (120/min). High fidelity left ventricular (LV) pressure, aortic pressure (AoP) and systolic time intervals (STI) were measured simultaneously as a control and each time with the AoP changes. LV max dp/dt was measured by an RC differentiation and DP/DT was calculated from the pressure pulses and systolic time intervals. Each change in AoP resulted in a significant change in isovolumic pressure (IP) and the changes were parallel. Changes in pre-ejection period (PEP) and LV max (dp/dt)/(IP) were parallel changes in IP. A significant direct relationship was found between changes in IP and PEP, and an inverse relationship existed between changes in PEP and LV max (dp/dt)/(IP). Changes in LV max dp/dt and calculated DP/DT were parallel and approached unity. Thus, afterload changes with resultant changes in IP directly alter PEP and inversely affect max (dp/dt)/(IP). These effects of pure afterload changes must be considered in clinical pharmacologic studies when LV contractility is evaluated. Furthermore, calculated DP/DT can be used to measure changes in max dp/dt because of the close relationship between these two parameters.", "Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the interleukin-10 gene: differences in frequencies, linkage disequilibrium patterns, and haplotypes in three United States ethnic groups.\nInterleukin-10 (IL-10) is a cytokine that seems to function as a downregulator of the innate (nonadaptive) immune system. Approximately three-quarters of interindividual variability in human IL-10 levels has been attributed to genetic variation, and there is evidence suggesting a potential role for IL-10 in a range of human diseases. To provide a basis for haplotype analysis and future disease association studies, we characterized genetic variation in IL10 by sequencing all exons, and 2.5 kb of the 5'- and the 3'-flanking region in a panel of DNA samples from 24 African Americans, 23 European Americans, and 24 Hispanic Americans. The region sequenced was found to contain 28 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 16 with frequency >2% and 14 with frequency >5%. All SNPs with frequency >5% were present in subjects from all three populations. No SNP caused amino acid changes. Differences in pairwise linkage-disequilibrium (LD) patterns and in SNP and haplotype frequency distributions among the three populations may be of potential importance for disease association studies.", "Interleukin 1 is more than an interleukin.\nGery and co-workers(1) first described lymphocyte activating factor (LAF) in 1972, as an activity produced by cultured human peripheral blood adherent leukocytes which was directly mitogenic for murine thymocytes but not for immunocompetent peripheral lymphocytes. Human LAF also synergistically augmented the mitogenic effects of the lectins ConA and PHA on murine thymocytes and splenic T lymphocytes(1). Since then LAF has been shown to promote lymphocyte differentiation and functions and even to affect a variety of nonlymphocytic larget cells. In view of the many biological activities attributed to this macrophage-derived factor, LAF was renamed 'interleukin 1' (IL 1) at the Second International Lymphokine Workshop at Ermatingen, Switzerland, in 1979(2). Partly as a consequence of the resultant controversy, this term has become widely known and will be used in this review, even though, as J. J. Oppenheim and Igal Gery show, IL 1 is more than a signal between leukocytes.", "Modeling investigation of learning a fast elbow flexion in the horizontal plane--prediction of muscle forces and motor units action.\nExperimental investigation of practicing a dynamic, goal-directed movement reveals significant changes in kinematics. Modeling can provide insight into the alterations in muscle activity, associated with the kinematic adaptations, and reveal the potential motor unit (MU) firing patterns that underlie those changes. In this paper, a previously developed muscle model and software (Raikova and Aladjov, Journal of Biomechanics, 35, 2002) have been used to investigate changes in MU control, while practicing fast elbow flexion to a target in the horizontal plane. The first trial (before practice) and the last trial (after extensive practice) of two subjects have been simulated. The inputs for the simulation were the calculated external moments at the elbow joint. The external moments were countered by the action of three flexor muscles and two extensor ones. The muscles have been modeled as a mixture of MUs of different types. The software has chosen the MU firing times necessary to accomplish the movement. The muscle forces and MUs firing statistics were then calculated. Three hypotheses were tested and confirmed: (1) peak muscle forces and antagonist co-contraction increase during training; (2) there is an increase in the firing frequency and the synchronization between MUs; and (3) the recruitment of fast-twitch MUs dominates the action.", "Forced Oxidative Degradation Pathways of the Imidazole Moiety of Daclatasvir.\nDaclatasvir hydrochloride (DCV) is the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Daklinza, a marketed product for the treatment of hepatitis C viral infection. The intrinsic stability of daclatasvir was evaluated via a forced degradation study. DCV was found to be stable in the solid state. In solution, its carbamate moiety is susceptible to basic hydrolysis, whereas its imidazole is liable to base-mediated autoxidation to form degradants 1 and 3, 7-8, respectively. The imidazole moiety can also be oxidized to form degradants 6-7 in the presence of hydrogen peroxide or azobisisobutyronitrile. The chloro-adduct degradant 9 was also observed in hydrogen peroxide solution. Furthermore, the imidazole moiety is sensitive to photodegradation in solution. Degradants 2-8 were observed in a solution of DCV exposed to high intensity light/UV light; the formation of degradants 2 and 5-8 was postulated through 4 degradation pathways. The degradants 3 and 4 were deemed to be secondary degradants of 7 and 5, respectively.", "Saponin-based adjuvants create a highly effective anti-tumor vaccine when combined with in situ tumor destruction.\nToday's most commonly used microbial vaccines are essentially composed of antigenic elements and a non-microbial adjuvant, and induce solid amounts of antibodies. Cancer vaccines mostly aim to induce anti-tumor CTL-responses, which require cross-presentation of tumor-derived antigens by dendritic cells (DCs). Adjuvants that improve DC function and antigen cross-presentation are therefore advantageous for inducing anti-tumor immunity. Previously, we have reported that in situ tumor destruction of established murine tumors by ablation efficiently delivers antigens to DC for the in vivo induction of anti-tumor immunity. Yet, tumor ablation alone resulted in only partial protection against a subsequent tumor-challenge. In this article, the ability of various non-microbial vaccine adjuvants to modulate the immune response following cryo-ablation was tested. The data show that tumor ablation with co-injection of saponin-based adjuvants, but not oil-in-water, water-in-oil or alum-based adjuvants, creates a highly effective in situ vaccine. Draining lymph node CD11c+ DCs acquire antigens more efficiently and become increasingly activated following ablation with saponin adjuvants relative to ablation alone. Moreover, our data reveal that the saponin-based adjuvants facilitate an in this model unprecedented level of antigen cross-presentation, induction of tumor-specific CTL and long-lasting tumor protection. Collectively, combining saponin-based adjuvants with in situ tumor destruction leads to an extremely potent systemic anti-tumor response. This combination approach forms a powerful in situ DC vaccine for which no prior knowledge of tumor antigens is required. As saponin-based adjuvants are currently clinically available, they represent attractive tools for various human and veterinary settings where in situ tumor destruction is applied.", "Multicenter retrospective study of retinal detachment associated with atopic dermatitis.\nEpidemiological and clinical study of retinal detachment associated with atopic dermatitis. A multicenter retrospective study. We analyzed the records of 417 eyes of 348 patients operated on during 5 years from 1989 to 1993 and followed up for more than 6 months by vitreo-retinal specialists in 33 hospitals throughout Japan. The number of eyes operated on increased yearly from 42 in 1989 to 132 in 1993. These cases associated with atopic dermatitis were 2.3% of the average number of eyes operated on for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment during the same period, but when restricted to the Kanto area or further to Tokyo only, the percentage was as high as 3.8% and 4.7%, respectively. Clinical characteristics of retinal detachment previously reported, such as traumatic slapping or rubbing of the lids by patients as the most likely pathogenetic factor, and high incidence of cataract and proliferative vitreoretinopathy, were confirmed. The primary surgical procedure was scleral buckling in 78% of the cases and vitreous surgery in 22%, and initial and final reattachment rates were 75.3% and 92.6%, respectively.", "[Usefulness of thickness of the pelvic floor muscle as a predictor for urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy].\nA total of 49 patients were enrolled in this study. Voiding symptoms were investigated on medical records at 3 and 6 months after retropubic retrograde radical prostatectomy. Incontinence was defined as any involuntary urine leakage. First, clinical and surgical factors were analyzed in continent and incontinent patients. Then, the thickness of the pelvic diaphragm and the levator ani of 38 patients were measured on a monitor using a preoperative magnetic resonance image. The differences between these factors and the continent status were analyzed. Incontinence was noted in 57 and 29% of the patients at 3 and 6 months, respectively. There were significant differences in the thickness of the pelvic diaphragm on sagittal images between the continent and incontinent groups at both 3 and 6 months postoperatively (p = 0.006 and p = 0.02, respectively). There were no differences on other factors. The pelvic diaphragm thickness may be a predictive factor of post-prostatectomy incontinence. The data suggested that patients having a thin pelvic diaphragm might not be expected to achieve earlier recovery of continence after radical prostatectomy.", "Neurological outcome in high risk weight appropriate for gestational age preterm children at early school age.\nNeurological development in preterm children with birth weight appropriate for gestational age is reported in two separate groups: a longitudinal study of 97 preterm children and 93 term children as a control group and a cross-sectional study of 249 preterm children. Both preterm groups were regarded as high risk with respect to number of outborns, distribution of gestational age and perinatal risk factors. Neurological outcome at 5-6 years of age in the majority of the preterm children was comparable to that of the term children. However, 15% of boys and 9% of girls in the preterm group were diagnosed as having cerebral palsy. Mild diplegia was most frequently observed; 4% of the children were severely impaired. Fourteen percent of the preterm vs 2% of the term boys and 6-9% of the preterm vs none of the term girls received motor therapy during early school age. There was a small but consistent sex difference in neurological outcome in favour of the term and preterm girls. Effects of drop out rate and of incompleteness of ascertainment are reported in detail.", "Bronchoscopic and cytopathological findings of tracheobronchial involvement in esophageal carcinoma.\nTo evaluate the usefulness of bronchoscopic and cytopathologic examinations for tracheobronchial involvement of esophageal carcinoma, we reviewed 14 cases of esophageal carcinoma suspected of tracheobronchial invasion. Two cases underwent bronchoscopy for postoperative respiratory symptoms, and both revealed endotracheal tumor growth and proved positive at brush cytology and biopsy. Among nine cases submitted to preoperative examination, bronchoscopy showed only protrusion in four cases, and redness with mucosal protrusion in five cases. Two of the latter evidenced cancer cells on brushing specimen, and their prognosis was poor. The remaining three cases underwent bronchoscopy for preoperative severe respiratory symptoms. Tumor growth was noted in two of them, and cytology or biopsy was positive. We conclude that bronchoscopy for tracheobronchial involvement of esophageal carcinoma plays a major role in the diagnosis of extra-esophageal extension. Because of the anatomical situation, biopsy is sometimes difficult. Brush cytology is important in the case of mucosal protrusion and redness.", "Presence of the BRAF V600E point mutation in morphologically benign appearing thyroid inclusions of cervical lymph nodes.\nThe biologic nature of morphologically bland-appearing thyroid inclusions in cervical lymph nodes continues to be a controversial topic. The diagnosis of benignity entails a much more conservative clinical approach than does malignancy. Arriving at the correct interpretation, however, can be difficult when only morphologic examination is performed. Incorporating the use of the recently identified BRAF V600E point mutation, a highly specific biomarker for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, may provide a useful adjunct in assessing the biologic nature of morphologically bland-appearing thyroid inclusions in cervical lymph nodes. In this case report, bland thyroid inclusions were noted in addition to a primary papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and morphologically recognizable cervical lymph node metastasis. Cells from these separate entities were procured by lasercapture microdissection, and the DNA was isolated, amplified, and sequenced. Molecular analysis provided integral data indicating these morphologically bland thyroid inclusions were malignant, findings not readily apparent by morphologic examination alone.", "Comparison of IMRT techniques in the radiotherapeutic management of head and neck cancer: is tomotherapy \"better\" than step-and-shoot IMRT?\nCurrently, the most common method of delivering intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is through step-and-shoot, segmental multi-leaf collimator (SMLC)-based techniques. Although rotational delivery methods such as helical tomotherapy (HT) have been proposed as offering advantages in the treatment of head and neck cancer, a lack of clinical data exists on its potential utility. This study compared dosimetric, clinical, and quality-of-life endpoints among 149 patients treated by HT and SMLC-IMRT for head and neck cancer. Dosimetric analysis revealed that the use of HT resulted in significant improvements with respect to mean dose (23.5 versus 27.9 Gy, p = 0.03) and V30 (30.1 versus 43.9 Gy, p = 0.01) to the contralateral (spared) parotid gland. However, the incidence of grade 3+ xerostomia in the late setting was 10% and 8% among patients treated by HT and SMLC-IMRT, respectively (p = 0.46). There were no significant differences in any of the quality of life endpoints among patients treated by HT and SMLC-IMRT (p > 0.05, for all). Acknowledging the biases inherent in this retrospective analysis, we found that the dosimetric advantages observed with HT compared to SMLC-IMRT failed to translate into significant improvements in clinical outcome. Prospective studies are needed to further evaluate how HT may affect the therapeutic ratio.", "Respiratory complications after major surgery.\nTo discuss the recent literature concerning the significance of respiratory complications as a determining factor in postoperative complications after major surgery. Although many studies have identified risk factors focusing on the prevention of respiratory complications, these complications continue to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Here, we will examine the diagnosis, contributing factors, consequences, and early treatment of respiratory complications. General anesthesia and surgery are the main causes of postoperative respiratory complications. Atelectasis, a common respiratory complication, may contribute to pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. Recently, it has been shown that activation of abdominal muscles during the induction of anesthesia contributes to a reduction of lung capacity, leading to a higher degree of atelectasis. Additionally, long-term mortality at 5 and 10 years has recently been shown to remain significantly increased in patients with respiratory complications. Prevention or early therapy of respiratory complications may, therefore, be beneficial in improving outcome in postoperative patients. Postoperative respiratory complications may have significant deleterious consequences. Increasing the understanding of the underlying causes of respiratory complications and developing early treatment strategies will likely provide improved benefits. To date, early treatment with prophylactic or therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure has proved beneficial in an abdominal surgical patient population; however, the efficacy in a general population remains unclear.", "Stimulated release of arachidonic acid by agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and retinoic acid receptors.\nRelease of arachidonic acid from rat liver cells is stimulated after a 6-hour incubation with 9-cis retinoic acid, all trans retinoic acid, the selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma synthetic thiazolidinedione, ciglitazone, the cyclopentenones, 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14) PGJ2 and PGA1 and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, celecoxib and indomethacin. The rates of the release stimulated by 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14) PGJ2 differ from those observed with celecoxib. Arachidonic acid release by9-cis retinoic acid in the presence of either ciglitazone or trans retinoic acid is synergistic. It is additive in the presence of celecoxib. Cycloheximide and actinomycin inhibit the release of arachidonic acid stimulated by 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14) PGJ2 but not by celecoxib. The findings indicate that agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and retinoic acid receptors stimulate the release of arachidonic acid. The mechanisms involved may differ in the cases of 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14) PGJ2 and celecoxib.", "Influence of legislation in toxicology.\nThe influence of toxicology on legislation is quite clear in countries where chemicals are regulated by the authorities. There is normally a toxicological evaluation--in addition to other considerations--behind sales and use permissions and the levels that are accepted in food, air, water, etc. How does legislation affect toxicology? If there is no legislation, then clinical and forensic toxicology will be the most used toxicological disciplines (accidents and other cases of poisoning). The more sophisticated and restrictive the legislation becomes, the more toxicology is used not only to permit the use of chemicals but also to ban them. In addition, legislation for the protection of experimental animals has a profound influence in toxicology and accelerates the use of in vitro and other alternative methods. This paper discusses whether countries in the \"developed\" world are overdoing it, thereby maybe hampering the essential use of chemicals in the developing countries.", "International expert consensus conference on testosterone deficiency and its treatment held in Prague, Czech Republic.\nAn international expert consensus conference regarding testosterone deficiency (TD) (also known as hypogonadism) and its treatment was held on 1 October 2015, in Prague, Czech Republic. The impetus for this meeting was to address several key scientific issues that have been misunderstood or distorted during the recent intense media attention to this topic. Eighteen experts from 11 countries participated, from the disciplines of urology, endocrinology, andrology, diabetology, and basic science research. The goal was to identify scientific concepts for which there was broad agreement. It was noted that recent public controversies regarding testosterone therapy have been anchored by two retrospective studies reporting increased cardiovascular (CV) risks. Both these studies contained major flaws, and are contradicted by a large body of evidence suggesting CV benefits with testosterone therapy. Other topics discussed included the negative impact of TD on male health; the questionable validity of restrictions on treatment based on age-specific cut-offs, presence of identified underlying conditions, or application of rigid biochemical thresholds; and the lack of evidence regarding prostate cancer risks. Final consensus statements (resolutions) are under development. It is hoped these will serve as a scientific foundation for further discussion, and will thereby reduce misinformation regarding TD and its treatment.", "Impairment of dilator responses of cerebral arterioles during diabetes mellitus: role of inducible NO synthase.\nDuring diabetes, expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) plays an important role in the development of endothelial dysfunction in extracranial blood vessels. Progression of vascular dysfunction after the onset of diabetes differs among vascular beds. In this study, the effects of hyperglycemia/diabetes on vasomotor function were examined in cerebral arterioles at 2 different times in control and iNOS-deficient mice and compared with the effects on carotid arteries. Streptozotocin (150 mg/kg IP) was given to induce diabetes. The diameter of cerebral arterioles was measured through a cranial window in diabetic and nondiabetic mice in vivo. Vasomotor function of the carotid artery was examined in vitro. In diabetic mice, responses of the cerebral arterioles to acetylcholine (1 mumol/L) were normal after 3 weeks of diabetes but were significantly impaired after 5 to 6 weeks of diabetes (4+/-1% [mean+/-SEM] increase in diameter) compared with control mice (14+/-1; P=0.0002). Responses to sodium nitroprusside were similar in diabetic and nondiabetic mice at both time points. In contrast, the vasomotor function of the carotid artery was not affected after 5 to 6 weeks of diabetes. In diabetic iNOS-deficient mice, cerebral arteriolar vasomotor function was not impaired, even after 4 months of diabetes. During diabetes, endothelial dysfunction of cerebral arterioles requires expression of iNOS and develops earlier than in carotid arteries.", "Histological findings at the boundary of craniopharyngiomas.\nAlthough a craniopharyngioma is grossly well circumscribed, microscopically the borders are frequently irregular and may be associated with gliosis in the adjacent brain tissue. In the current study, we investigated the histology of the interface between craniopharyngiomas and surrounding normal structures such as the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Histologically, we classified the findings at the boundary of craniopharyngiomas into three types. In type 1, a relatively thick capsule-like tissue was identified at the boundary between the craniopharyngioma and surrounding normal structure composed of tumor cells and inflammatory changes. In type 2, a craniopharyngioma had a relatively clear cleavage between the surrounding gliosis. In type 3, the boundary had some interdigitation of the tumor in the surrounding gliotic layer adjacent to the craniopharyngioma. In types 1 and 3, surgeons may fail to accomplish complete resection of the tumor. These histological features may result in recurrence of craniopharyngioma even after gross total resection.", "Flight capacity increases then declines from the core to the margins of an invasive species' range.\nIndividuals that disperse farther than other individuals are more likely to be on the frontlines of spreading populations and may be more likely to mate with one another as a consequence of their spatial proximity. Over generations, this process-known as spatial sorting-can produce patterns of increasing dispersal ability from a population's core towards the spreading front. By contrast, when the spread of a population is limited by the availability of suitable habitat, theory predicts that range boundaries can select against more dispersive phenotypes and produce patterns of decreasing dispersal capacity towards population margins. In a common garden study of invasive kudzu bugs (Megacopta cribraria)-which are limited by the availability of hostplants in their southern and western margins-I show that midrange individuals fly 49% farther than individuals in the core and 37% farther than individuals at margins. This result highlights that other processes, such as maternal effects or selection at range boundaries, may create more complicated patterns of dispersal ability across landscapes than predicted by models of spatial sorting alone.", "Peripheral T-cell subsets in asymptomatic hepatitis B-virus carriers.\nTo ascertain whether the abnormalities of circulating T-cell subsets in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related chronic liver diseases represent the primary immunological process or are secondary to liver disease process, peripheral T-cell subsets were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies against total T cells (OKT3), T helper/inducer cells (OKT4), and T suppressor/cytotoxic cells (OKT8), in 30 asymptomatic HBV carriers without biochemical or histological evidence of liver disease, and the results were compared to 15 HBV-induced chronic active liver diseases. The results revealed that OKT4/OKT8 ratios were significantly reduced in 15 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive asymptomatic carriers as compared with controls, with decreased OKT4-positive cells and increased OKT8-positive cells, while T-cell subsets and ratios were normal in 15 hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe)-positive asymptomatic carriers. The changes of circulating T-cell subsets in 15 HBe-Ag-positive asymptomatic carriers showed no significant difference from those of 15 HBeAg-positive patients with chronic active liver diseases. These findings suggest that the deranged T-cell subsets in chronic HBV infection are not secondary to liver cell damage, but might represent the underlying immunological abnormalities which are closely related to HBeAg/anti-HBe status, and that the pathogenetic mechanism of liver cell damage in chronic HBV infection may not be simply related to circulating T-cell subsets.", "Catalytic activity and expression of two flavin-containing monooxygenases from Drosophila melanogaster.\nTwo flavin-containing monooxygenase genes occur in the Drosophila genome (named DmFMO-1 and DmFMO-2). Differences exist between these two FMOs in: (1) genomic DNA architecture and predicted post-translational modifications; (2) recombinant protein solubility, activity, and absorbance spectra; and (3) subcellular distribution and developmental transcription/translation profiles in wildtype flies. Characteristic FAD absorbance spectra and strong catalytic competence in methimazole sulfoxidation were observed for recombinant DmFMO-2. Alternatively, weak sulfoxidation was observed for DmFMO-1, which correlated with reduced solubility in the recombinant system. Western blot analyses using specific antisera raised to each FMO showed the two FMOs to be immunologically distinct. In addition, Western blot analyses revealed FMO protein expression in both the microsomal and cytosolic sub-cellular fractions. Interestingly, a larger form of DmFMO-1 occurs in the cytosol that is most strongly expressed in the adult head. These findings suggest divergent physiological roles for DmFMO-1 and DmFMO-2. More specifically, it appears that DmFMO-1 has a distinct developmental role, while DmFMO-2 may have a general housekeeping function.", "Clinical and prognostic effects of CDKN2A, CDKN2B and CDH13 promoter methylation in ovarian cancer: a study using meta-analysis and TCGA data.\nBackground: Promoter methylation of tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) CDKN2A, CDKN2B and CDH13 has been reported in ovarian cancer. However, the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic role of CDKN2A, CDKN2B and CDH13 promoter methylation in ovarian carcinoma remained unclear. Methods: The pooled odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratios (HRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated in this meta-analysis. The Cancer Genome Atlas data were obtained to confirm the role of CDKN2A, CDKN2B and CDH13 methylation in ovarian cancer. Results: CDKN2A, CDKN2B and CDH13 promoter methylation was higher in ovarian cancer than in normal ovarian tissues. CDH13 promoter methylation was correlated with tumour histology (serous vs. non-serous type: OR = 0.33, p = 0.031). CDKN2A promoter methylation was not linked to overall survival (OS), but it was correlated with a poor prognosis in progression-free survival (HR = 1.55, p = 0.004). TCGA data showed no correlation between CDKN2A, CDKN2B and CDH13 methylation and OS as well as disease-free survival (DFS). Conclusions: CDKN2A, CDKN2B and CDH13 promoter methylation may correlate with the increased risk of ovarian cancer. CDKN2A promoter methylation may be an independent prognostic biomarker for predicting progression-free survival.", "Lipopolysaccharide induces DNA binding activity specific for the IFN-stimulated response element in murine peritoneal macrophages.\nSeveral murine macrophage genes that exhibit transcriptional response to LPS (e.g., IP-10, D3) have IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) sequences present in regions flanking the transcription start sites. In the present study, the ability of LPS to activate proteins in murine peritoneal macrophages capable of binding to the ISRE has been investigated. Nuclear extracts from both LPS-treated and untreated macrophages are capable of forming four distinct complexes with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the ISRE sequence as detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. LPS-treated nuclei contained an additional ISRE binding activity (complex I) that was not found in unstimulated cells. The induction of the latter activity by LPS was sensitive to polymyxin B sulfate, a lipid A antagonist, demonstrating that LPS was the primary inducing activity. All five retarded protein-DNA complexes formed were specific for the ISRE sequence as shown by competition with a series of oligonucleotides containing either ISRE-related or -unrelated sequences. Complex I binding activity was dependent upon the concentration of LPS and the time of LPS treatment. Furthermore, complex I was similar to that induced in response to treatment with IFN-beta in terms of electrophoretic mobility and specificity for the ISRE. LPS-induced complex I formation was partially independent of protein synthesis and could not be blocked by including neutralizing antibody to IFN-alpha/beta in the culture medium. Thus, even though LPS is a potent inducer of IFN-beta in murine macrophages, class I IFN expression may not be an obligatory intermediate event in the LPS-driven activation of ISRE binding activity. These results suggest that induction of ISRE binding activity may be an important part of the signaling process initiated by LPS.", "Abstract The proposed project integrates groups from academia and industry to develop and perform initial testing of a novel platform for the potential eradication of HIV-1 by endowing the patient's own cells with stable resistance to HIV infection. To safely and effectively achieve such resistant cells, we propose to deploy a process call genome editing to either (i) perform targeted insertion of anti-HIV gene sequences, and/or permanently disrupt HIV relevant gene targets, directly in the genome of the patient's hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC). Genome editing is achieved by invoking the cell's own natural DNA repair pathways to heal a double-strand break (DSB) introduced in vivo at the target locus by an engineered DNA cleavage enzyme called a zinc finger nuclease (ZFN). This technology has recently entered the clinic in subjects with HIV, where the safety, tolerability and early evidence of genetic protection from HIV infection has been observed following an infusion of autologous CCR5 gene edited CD4+ T cells. While CCR5 is a validated target for development of HIV therapeutics, disruption of this gene in isolation will not confer resistance to dual or X4-tropic HIV isolates. To expand the potential application of genome edited HSPCs to achieve a potential cure for HIV our strategy is perform the genetic addition of anti-HIV gene products to a defined location in the stem cell genome. Specifically, we propose to develop targeted nucleases to enable the in situ editing of endogenous human restriction factors as well develop methods to achieve the site-specific addition of anti-HIV genes in the critical long term hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC). The latter has recently been identified as a key area for optimization of genome editing strategies in these promising therapeutic stem cells.", "The oxidative folding rate of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease is enhanced by a covalently attached oligosaccharide.\nBovine pancreatic ribonuclease B (RNase B) differs from RNase A by the presence of an oligosaccharide moiety covalently attached to Asn 34. Oxidative folding studies of RNase B were carried out at different temperatures using DTT(ox) as the oxidizing agent, and the results were compared with those for RNase A. The oxidative folding rates of RNase B are between 1.7 and 1.3 times faster than those of RNase A at the temperatures that were investigated. The folding pathways of RNase B were determined to be similar to those of RNase A in that two structured intermediates, each lacking one native disulfide bond, were found to populate the regeneration pathways at 25 degrees C and pH 8.3. The thermodynamic stabilities of these two glycosylated intermediates, and their rates of formation from their unstructured precursors in the rate-determining step, were found to be higher than those of their unglycosylated counterparts from RNase A. Thus, the underlying cause for the faster rate of oxidative regeneration of native RNase B appears to be both thermodynamic and kinetic due to the higher stability, and faster rate of formation, of the intermediates of RNase B compared to those of RNase A.", "Metabolism of the heart and brain during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass.\nThe alterations in tissue metabolism induced by hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass are not completely known. Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to determine the effect of hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass on energy states and intracellular pH of the heart and brain. Sheep were instrumented for cardiopulmonary bypass and had a radiofrequency coil placed over either the heart or skull. The animals were placed in a 4.7-T magnet at 37 degrees C and spectra obtained. The animals were cooled on cardiopulmonary bypass to either 26 degrees C (n = 17) or 18 degrees C (n = 14) for brain studies and to 26 degrees C (n = 12) for heart studies. Hypothermia increased the phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate ratio in the heart (2.38 +/- 0.23 versus 3.18 +/- 0.37, 37 degrees versus 26 degrees C, respectively, p = 0.03). The brain phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate ratio increased from 1.70 +/- 0.09 at 37 degrees C to 2.00 +/- 0.12 at 26 degrees C (p = 0.009) and 2.10 +/- 0.07 at 18 degrees C (p = 0.0001). Intracellular pH increased during hypothermia (heart: 7.05 +/- 0.02 to 7.18 +/- 0.02, 37 degrees versus 26 degrees C, p = 0.0001; and brain: 7.07 +/- 0.02 versus 7.32 +/- 0.02, 37 degrees versus 18 degrees C, p = 0.0001). The adenosine triphosphate resonance position is known to be sensitive to magnesium binding as well as temperature and was shifted upfield (p less than 0.01) in both the heart and brain. This effect could be totally explained by the temperature dependence of this process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "Cultivation, photobioreactor design and harvesting of microalgae for biodiesel production: a critical review.\nMicroalgae have the ability to mitigate CO(2) emission and produce oil with a high productivity, thereby having the potential for applications in producing the third-generation of biofuels. The key technologies for producing microalgal biofuels include identification of preferable culture conditions for high oil productivity, development of effective and economical microalgae cultivation systems, as well as separation and harvesting of microalgal biomass and oil. This review presents recent advances in microalgal cultivation, photobioreactor design, and harvesting technologies with a focus on microalgal oil (mainly triglycerides) production. The effects of different microalgal metabolisms (i.e., phototrophic, heterotrophic, mixotrophic, and photoheterotrophic growth), cultivation systems (emphasizing the effect of light sources), and biomass harvesting methods (chemical/physical methods) on microalgal biomass and oil production are compared and critically discussed. This review aims to provide useful information to help future development of efficient and commercially viable technology for microalgae-based biodiesel production.", "The use of magnesium sulfate in acute asthma: rapid uptake of evidence in North American emergency departments.\nSystematic reviews of approximately 13 randomized trials support treatment with intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)) in patients with severe acute asthma; however, little is known about its actual clinical use. We sought to examine the use of intravenous MgSO(4) in the emergency department (ED) and physician attitudes toward its use. Data for MgSO(4) use were obtained from observational cohort studies of ED patients with acute asthma. Investigators were asked about MgSO(4) through a brief Internet-based survey. The main outcomes were the percentage of sites reporting MgSO(4) use and patient factors that potentially modified the use of this agent. Among 9745 ED patients with acute asthma, 240 (2.5%) received MgSO(4). Increasing age, previous intubation, higher initial respiratory rate, lower initial PEF, higher number of beta-agonists in the ED, and use of systemic corticosteroids were associated with MgSO(4) use (P < .01). Overall, 103 (87%) of 119 potential sites completed the survey. Most (92%) respondents stated their EDs had MgSO(4) available, and 64% had recently used it. More respondents listed severity (96%) and failure to respond to initial beta-agonists (87%) as factors prompting their use of MgSO(4). Other factors, such as age, sex, and duration of exacerbation, less commonly influenced MgSO(4) use. Most ED physicians accept the efficacy of MgSO(4) in acute asthma. Despite this belief and the ready availability of MgSO(4), its ED use remains uncommon (2.5% of cases). In both practice and theory, emergency physicians appear to appropriately restrict its use to patients with severe acute asthma.", "The relation of diabetes to the severity of acute myocardial infarction and post-myocardial infarction survival in Mexican-Americans and non-Hispanic whites. The Corpus Christi Heart Project.\nThe effect of diabetes on survival after myocardial infarction (MI) was examined in a prospective population-based study of individuals hospitalized with MI in a bi-ethnic community of Mexican-Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Among Mexican-Americans, 54% (331 of 610) had diabetes compared with 33% (192 of 589) of non-Hispanic whites (P < 0.001). Among those with diabetes, the prevalence of a history of a cardiac event before the index admission was significantly higher (odds ratio = 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-1.8) than among nondiabetic subjects. During the index hospitalization, diabetic subjects received cardiac catheterization less frequently than did nondiabetic subjects (45.1 vs. 51.5%, P = 0.03). Diabetic subjects had lower estimated ejection fractions, and the number of coronary arteries with significant obstruction (> 75%) was higher (P < 0.001). The peak creatine phosphokinase and creatine phosphokinase myocardial isoenzyme (CK-MB) levels were similar in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. Despite a similar infarct size, diabetic subjects had a higher incidence of congestive heart failure (relative ratio = 2.2, 95% CI 1.7-2.8), more adverse indexes of short-term and long-term prognosis, and a longer average hospital stay (12.1 vs. 8.9 days, P < 0.01). After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, the cumulative risk for total mortality, over 44 months of follow-up, was 37.4% among diabetic compared with 23.3% among nondiabetic subjects (P < 0.001). Diabetic subjects had a higher 28-day case-fatality rate post-MI as well as higher long-term mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "Resuspension of sediments from the Elbe River can significantly decrease pH values due to high acid-producting potential and low neutralizing capacity. Metals can be released into the dissolved phase, but may subsequently be readsorbed or precipitated in part to solid phases. To evaluate the potential for metal release and scavenging on a regional and long-term scale, experiments were undertaken at stable neutral-pH values. Rates of total metal release and metal scavenging were extrapolated from time series of netrelease values measured over 630 hours. The order of total release from the sediment was Cd (5%) > Zn (1.5%) > Cu (1%) > Pb (0.7%). The scavenging of released metals was in the reverse order: Pb (86%) > Cu (53%) > Zn (34%) > Cd (30%). Dominant processes are adsorption on organic substances, adsorption/coprecipitation by fresh Fe-Mn oxides and precipitation of metal phosphates originating from the decomposition of organic matter. Based on our experimental results and relevant published data, a four-stage interaction model is developed for metals in anoxic sediments. This model describes the behavior of heavy metals in the system subsequent to oxidation.", "Standardization of diagnosis for coiling of the umbilical cord around fetal neck by ultrasound.\nTo elucidate classification of coiling of the umbilical cord around fetal neck (CUFN) by ultrasound and forming factors of entanglement angle of CUFN. From January 2006 to December 2012, color Doppler ultrasonic was used to observe the blood flow vector of umbilical artery, and prospective descriptive observation was made for entanglement direction and type of 707 single fetuses taking prenatal examination in our hospital during the middle and late trimester of pregnancy and having umbilical cord echo around the neck. The relationship of position of fetus, position of placenta and entanglement direction of umbilical cord with the entanglement angle of umbilical cord is analyzed. Among the 707 fetuses, 634 had one circle of coiling, 43 had two circles of coiling, two had three circles of coiling, and 28 had CUFN. According to entanglement direction, 361 had entanglement from left to right and 318 had entanglement from right to left According to entanglement type, 305 were C-shaped type (43.14%), 85 were O-shaped type (12.02%), 289 were \u03b1-shaped type (40.88%), and 28 were L-shaped type (3.96%). Color Doppler ultrasound was used to detect the entanglement direction of umbilical cord and establish the five-type classification of umbilical cord around the neck, laying the foundation for the feasibility of establishing the normalization of diagnostic standard of umbilical cord around the neck.", "Mouse DDA3 gene is a direct transcriptional target of p53 and p73.\nThe p53 tumor suppressor is a transcription factor that activates the expression of many target genes. We have previously reported the identification of a p53-regulated mouse gene DDA3. The 5' upstream genomic region of the mouse DDA3 was cloned, and sequence analysis revealed the presence of a potential p53 response element (RE2) residing at nucleotides +390 approximately +409 relative to the first translation start site. When fused upstream to a luciferase reporter gene, 5' genomic regions of the DDA3 gene containing RE2 were shown to be responsive to the wild-type, but not mutant p53, in a transient transfection assay. RE2 was sufficient to confer the transactivation responsiveness to p53. Furthermore, gel mobility shift analysis showed that RE2 formed specific complexes with wild-type p53. Induction of DDA3 was found in adriamycin treated normal mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEF), but not in p53 knockout (p53(-/-)) MEF. Overexpression of p73 induced DDA3 mRNA expression, and luciferase reporter analysis indicated that RE2 was responsive to transactivation by members of the p73 family proteins. Consistent with these findings, elevated expression of p73 protein and DDA3 mRNA were observed concomitantly in the p53(-/-) MEF cells treated with cisplatin. These results together demonstrated that DDA3 is a transcriptional target gene of p53 and its related-protein p73.", "Evaluating Behavior in Mouse Models of the Behavioral Variant of Frontotemporal Dementia: Which Test for Which Symptom?\nThe behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting people in their early sixties, characterized by dramatic changes in individual and social behavior. Despite the heterogeneity in the presentation of the clinical symptoms of bvFTD, some characteristic changes can be highlighted. Social disinhibition, changes in food preferences as well as loss of empathy and apathy are commonly described. This is accompanied by a characteristic and dramatic atrophy of the prefrontal cortex with the accumulation of protein aggregates in the neurons in this area. Several causative mutations in different genes have been discovered, allowing the development of transgenic animal models, especially mouse models. In mice, attention has been focused on the histopathological aspects of the pathology, but now studies are taking interest in assessing the behavioral phenotype of FTD models. Finding the right test corresponding to human symptoms is quite challenging, especially since the frontal cortex is much less developed in mice than in humans. Although challenging, the ability to detect relevant prefrontal cortex impairments in mice is crucial for therapeutic approaches. In this review, we aim to present the approaches that have been used to model the behavioral symptoms of FTD and to explore other relevant approaches to assess behavior involving the prefrontal cortex, as well as the deficits associated with FTD.", "A new dynamic model of the cortico-basal ganglia loop.\nAn important issue in the neural control of posture and movement is how motor-related areas of the cerebral cortex modulate the activity of the output nuclei of the basal ganglia. In this chapter, the functional significance of the 'hyperdirect' cortico-subthalamo-pallidal pathway is emphasized, and further a new dynamic model of basal ganglia function is presented. When a voluntary movement is about to be initiated by cortical mechanisms, a corollary signal is conveyed through the 'hyperdirect' pathway to first inhibit large areas of the thalamus and cerebral cortex that are related to both the selected motor program and other competing programs. Next, another corollary signal is sent through the 'direct' cortico-striato-pallidal pathway to disinhibit this second pathway's targets, and ensure activation of only the selected motor program. Finally, a third corollary signal is sent through the 'indirect' cortico-striato-external pallido-subthalamo-internal pallidal pathway to strongly inhibit this third pathway's targets. This sequential information processing ensures that only the selected motor program is initiated, executed and terminated at the appropriate times, whereas other competing programs are canceled.", "Design, construction and performance of a horizontal subsurface flow wetland system in Australia.\nMalabugilmah is a remote Aboriginal community located in Clarence Valley, Northern NSW, Australia. In 2006, seven horizontal subsurface flow wetland clusters consisting of 3 m \u00d7 2 m wetland cells in series were designed and constructed to treat septic tank effluent to a secondary level (Total Suspended Solids (TSS) < 30 mg/L and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5) <20 mg/L) and achieve >50% Total Nitrogen (TN) reduction, no net Total Phosphorus (TP) export and \u226599.9% Faecal Coliform (FC) reduction. The wetland cell configuration allowed the wetlands to be located on steeper terrain, enabling effluent to be treated to a secondary level without the use of pumps. In addition to the water quality targets, the wetlands were designed and constructed to satisfy environmental, economic and social needs of the community. The wetland systems were planted with a local Australian wetland tree species which has become well established. Two wetland clusters have been monitored over the last 4 years. The wetlands have demonstrated to be robust over time, providing a high level of secondary treatment over an extended period.", "The relationship between patient age and astigmatism magnitude after congenital cataract surgery.\nTo evaluate the magnitude of refractive astigmatism after congenital cataract surgery and to define its correlation with patient age. The authors retrospectively reviewed the charts of all pediatric patients who underwent congenital cataract extraction with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation through a 3.0-mm clear corneal incision from 1998 to 2003, and had no suture removal for 5 months afterward. Thirty-four children were included, aged 2 months to 15 years. Refractive astigmatism was assessed manually 1 week, 3 months, and 5 months after surgery by an experienced optometrist. The paired t test was used to compare the magnitude of postoperative astigmatism at different postoperative periods. Spearman correlation was used to determine the correlation between patient age and the postoperative refractive astigmatism. Mean refractive astigmatism in all patients was 1.8+/-1.5 diopters (D) at 1 week postoperatively. It significantly decreased to 1.0+/-0.7 D at 3 months postoperatively (p=0.001), and to 0.8+/-0.7 D at 5 months postoperatively (p=0.03). The change in astigmatism was significantly greater during the first 3 postoperative months than during the following 2 months (p=0.04). Patient age was significantly correlated with 1 week postoperative astigmatism (Spearman coefficient, r = -0.46; p=0.006) and with 3 months postoperative astigmatism (Spearman coefficient, r =-0.37; p=0.03). Congenital cataract surgery using a small, clear corneal incision for IOL implantation caused high early postoperative astigmatism, which spontaneously regressed thereafter. Younger patients had higher early postoperative astigmatism.", "Cervicomediastinal magnetic resonance imaging in persistent or recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma: clinical use and limits.\nCervicomediastinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was evaluated in 13 consecutive persistent or recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients, previously treated by total thyroidectomy and radioiodine ablation. All had elevated thyroglobulin (Tg) levels and were therefore submitted to a new therapeutic radioiodine dose followed by a posttherapeutic whole-body scan (131I-WBS) and subsequent MRI. Patients with known distant metastases were excluded from the study. Group 1 included 7 patients with a negative 131I-WBS, whereas cervical and/or mediastinal 131I-uptake was evidenced in the other 6 patients (group 2). MRI was thus compared to 131I-WBS, and additionally in 8 reoperated cases, to histology. MRI was positive in 11 of 13 (85%) patients, corresponding to 23 of 55 (41.8%) histologically confirmed sites. In group 1, MRI was positive in 5 of 7 patients, with a sensitivity of 47% (15/32 histologically positive sites), allowing appropriate indication of surgery: 4 neck surgery, and 1 mediastinal dissection because of too distant lymph node foci. In group 2, MRI always showed more localization than 131I-WBS; histology was obtained in 3. Because all the foci located in the mediastinal area (0.8 to 1.8 cm) were histologically confirmed (7/7 sites), MRI avoided underestimation of surgery in the 8 reoperated patients. However, additional images were also observed corresponding to a normal thymus, a small neuroma or inflammatory lymph nodes, but pretracheal and very small nodes (less than 0.5 cm) were missed. In conclusion, although less specific than radioiodine scintigraphy, MRI can detect local persistent or recurrent PTC, and seems particularly effective for evaluation of mediastinal involvement.", "Color-flow Doppler sonography in the differential diagnosis and management of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.\nAmiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) may be caused by excessive thyroidal hormone synthesis and release (type 1) or by a destructive process (type 2). This differentiation is considered essential for therapeutic choice. To evaluate the utility of color-flow Doppler sonography (CFDS) in the differential diagnosis and management of AIT. The clinical and laboratory data, thyroid sonography (grayscale sonography [GSS], CFDS), thyroid radioiodine uptake (RAIU) and thyroid scintigraphy, treatment, and clinical outcome were retrospectively reviewed in 21 AIT patients. The CFDS pattern of thyroid nodules was separately described from that of the perinodular parenchyma, and AIT was classified as type 1 (increased blood flow) or type 2 (low/no blood flow). Type 1 AIT patients were treated with methimazole (alone or associated with potassium perchlorate), while type 2 patients were treated with prednisone or amiodarone withdrawal alone. Eleven patients with increased blood flow were considered as type 1, and 10 with low/no blood flow as type 2. Ten of the 11 patients in the first group showed a hypervascular nodular pattern, while one showed a hypervascular parenchymal pattern. Clinical diagnoses were toxic nodular goiter and Graves' disease, respectively. Of the 10 patients with low/no blood flow, six had normal thyroid volume, three small diffuse goiter, and one small multinodular goiter. The clinical outcome showed that 20 of the 21 patients were treatment responsive. CFDS is a useful tool in the differential diagnosis of AIT. This differentiation appeared to be of clinical relevance as regards therapeutic choice. Separate evaluation of parenchymal blood flow from that of nodules may prove beneficial in the diagnosis of underlying thyroid diseases in patients with type 1 AIT.", "The burden of pneumococcal disease among adults in developed and developing countries: what is and is not known.\nThe burden of pneumococcal disease among adults in developed countries is neither widely known nor appreciated. The incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia is uncertain because a precise diagnosis cannot be obtained for most patients. Population-based data on invasive pneumococcal disease (e.g., bacteraemia and meningitis) suggest an annual incidence in all developed countries of > or =15-20 cases per 100,000 persons of all ages and > or =50 cases per 100,000 elderly adults (> or =65 years). In developing countries there are no population-based data on the burden of pneumococcal disease among adults. Studies of high risk groups, hospital-based studies, vaccine efficacy trials, extrapolations from surveillance of \"native populations\" in developed countries, and demographic studies in developing regions all suggest a high burden of disease. The broad variation in these estimates, however, indicates that better studies are needed. Increased use of pneumococcal vaccines among adults in all countries will depend on better scientific and public understanding of the burden of pneumococcal disease. In developing countries, intensive community-based studies of the impact of pneumococcal disease, or, alternatively, a \"vaccine probe\" approach, in which a population is vaccinated and the reduction in pneumonia is compared with that in a control population, could give more accurate estimates of the burden of disease and of the potential effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination among adults.", "LINCOLN HEIGHTS, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Perhaps it's a sight many wouldn't expect near downtown Los Angeles, but a winery in Lincoln Heights is celebrating its 100th anniversary.The San Antonio Winery has been a landmark in Lincoln Heights since 1917, and after four generations, it appears to be stronger than ever.\"Let's say I started at 2 years old. So I've been doing this for 66 years,\" Santo Riboli, president of the San Antonio Winery said with a laugh.While 66 years sounds like a long time, Santo Riboli's mother and father have him beat. Even though they're in their mid-90s, they're still active participants at the winery.\"They've been working here together for over 70 years,\" Santo Riboli said.And now the fourth generation, Anthony Riboli, heads the wine making operations at San Antonio Winery.\"My grandparents, they worked hard. There are those days when you're tired and your knee hurts and it's like no, no, no. These people were working 12 hours a day all the time. Let's keep it going,\" Anthony Riboli said.Making it to the 100 year point has not been easy for the San Antonio Winery. There were 90 wineries in Los Angeles back in 1917.Shortly after prohibition ended though, San Antonio Winery was the only one left standing.The perseverance has paid off, as San Antonio Winery now has tasting rooms in Paso Robles and Ontario. Their wine is also sold worldwide.The secret to good grapes is the roots, and that's something the Ribolis never forget.\"My mother, great visionary, always said, 'Never leave Los Angeles,'\" Santo Riboli said.", "Immunohistochemical analysis of proteins of the Bcl-2 family in pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis: association of Bcl-2 expression with hormone receptor status.\nPulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a disease of young women, is characterized by proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle cells (LAM cells), which often differ from normal pulmonary smooth muscle cells by frequently having estrogen and progesterone receptors. To evaluate the relationships among several factors related to proliferation and apoptosis in LAM cells, we employed immunohistochemical methods for the localization of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 (inhibitors of apoptosis), Bax (a promoter of apoptosis), c-Myc (an apoptosis-related oncoprotein), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (an indicator of mitotic activity), and nick end labeling (to identify apoptotic cells) in lung tissues of 9 patients with LAM. In all patients, most LAM cells reacted positively for Bax. The LAM cells were positive for both Bcl-2 and estrogen receptor in 5 patients, positive for only Bcl-2 in 1 patient, positive for only estrogen receptor in another patient, and negative for both in 2 patients. More than 50% of the Bcl-2-positive LAM cells were also positive for estrogen receptor. The reaction for c-Myc was positive in all patients. The immunoreactivity for Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, which inhibit apoptosis, was more intense in LAM cells than in normal vascular and bronchial smooth muscle cells. In 6 patients, more than 50% of the LAM cells were positive for proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Apoptosis was infrequent in LAM cells. Our results suggest that the expression of Bcl-2 in LAM cells may be related to hormonal regulation, and that by decreasing apoptosis, Bcl-2 and related proteins contribute to the imbalance between proliferation and death of LAM cells.", "[Tracheal deformity observed in tracheostomized Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients who can speak with appropriately inflated cuff of tracheal tube].\nRespiratory failure occurring during late adolescence is a major cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). A number of respiratory assistance techniques including tracheostomy and positive pressure mechanical ventilation have been utilized not only to prolong DMD patients' life but also to improve quality of their life. It is surprising that most of the tracheostomized DMD patients can speak under positive pressure ventilatory assistance. Preserved functions of glosso-pharyngo-laryngeal muscles in these patients presumably make it possible to control the air leak around tracheal tube, which does not necessitate tight inflation of the tube cuff. Recently we noticed that some patients are still able to speak even when the cuff is fully inflated. In order to understand the mechanism of this phenomenon, we visualized the topographical relationship between trachea and the tube cuff using computed tomography by filling the cuff with aqueous contrast medium. We obtained following findings: 1) Trachea is flat and deviated from normal midline position, and 2) the tube cuff is located eccentrically in trachea resulting in compression of one side of the inner wall and leaving open space on the other side. We conclude that the tracheal malposition and deformity underlie this strange phenomenon and tight inflation of the cuff to prevent air leak may result in unfavorable complications in DMD patients.", "Reduced PM2.5 in Trujillo, Peru, on El Dia Sin Autos (\"The Day Without Cars\").\nStreet-level and rooftop (three-story building) concentrations of particulate matter < or = 2.5 microm in diameter (PM2.5) were measured in downtown Trujillo, Peru, in July and August 2003 to determine the PM2.5 concentration reduction on days with normal traffic conditions (32 days) versus a day when motor vehicles were temporarily banned from the downtown district (8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., July 15) known as El Dia Sin Autos (\"The Day Without Cars\"). The mean 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. street-level PM2.5 concentration during the motor vehicle ban (21.4 microg/m3; one day) was 49% lower than when vehicles were not impeded (42.2 +/- 7.8 microg/m3--mean +/- 1 standard deviation; 20 days). The rooftop monitoring station indicated a 20% decrease in PM2.5 concentrations (24.8 +/- 2.6 microg/m3 vs. 19.9 +/- 6.0 microg/m3) when motor vehicles were not present within historic downtown Trujillo. Temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed during the motor vehicle ban and during normal traffic were not significantly different (p > .05).", "Creating a strategic management plan for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provision.\nWe were commissioned by the West Midlands NHS Regional Specialized Services Group (RSSG) to formulate a strategic plan for the management of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) within the West Midlands, UK. We needed to establish whether an increase in MRI provision was required, and if so to develop criteria to shape both the nature and location of MRI provision. We found that the UK had relatively low MRI provision per capita by international standards, and that the West Midlands region of the UK had less than the UK average level of MRI provision per capita. Within the region there was a 'mixed economy' of MRI provision involving fixed site scanners owned by the NHS and private companies, and private sector mobile MRI provision. There was little evidence of inappropriate MRI use, but considerable evidence of under-provision. Most MRI scanners in the region were heavily utilized, and average waiting times for MRI frequently exceeded guidelines (of a maximum 13-week wait for non-urgent MRI scans). Projections from NHS Trusts, MRI suppliers, and experts in the MRI field, led us to the conclusion that demand for MRI was likely to grow by between 12.5 and 18.5% per annum. This implies that 8-14 additional MRI scanners might be required within the West Midlands over the next 5 years, to meet existing, and rising demand for MRI. We therefore developed criteria (outlined in the paper) to enhance the productive and allocative efficiency of the deployment of MRI provision, whilst improving the configuration of MRI with reference to geographical equality of access to MRI.", "Early detection by diffusion-weighted sequence magnetic resonance imaging of severe brain lesions after fetoscopic laser coagulation for twin-twin transfusion syndrome.\nMonochorionic twins treated by fetoscopic laser coagulation (FLC) for twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment. Our aim was to evaluate the additional value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) over fetal sonography and T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the detection of acute ischemic cerebral lesions shortly following FLC. This was a prospective cohort study of fetuses with TTTS treated by FLC. All fetuses underwent brain DWI and T2-MRI within 24-96 h after the procedure and a follow-up MRI at 30-32 weeks' gestation. All fetuses also had frequent ultrasound evaluation until delivery. Thirty pregnancies with TTTS were included in the study. Eight resulted in survival of only one twin after the procedure (Group A), while the other 22 pregnancies resulted in the survival of both twins (Group B), as assessed at the time of initial MRI. Two fetuses in Group A and four in Group B had evidence of transient bleeding in the germinal matrix. Three fetuses in Group B and none in Group A had diffuse ischemic changes in the white matter. One fetus died in utero 24 h after MRI. The other two fetuses in Group B demonstrated an acute infarct 24-48 h after the procedure. Subsequent scans at 28-29 and 32 weeks showed brain atrophy compatible with an old infarct. DWI can demonstrate cerebral damage immediately after FLC. Larger cohorts are needed to determine the role of fetal MRI in the prenatal assessment and follow-up of patients with TTTS.", "Treatment of external biliary, pancreatic and intestinal fistulas with a somatostatin analog.\nSomatostatin and its long-acting analog octreotide (SMS 201-995) inhibit several gastrointestinal functions. Their effects have been studied in the treatment of small numbers of external pancreatic, intestinal and biliary fistulas. We treated 8 biliary, 4 pancreatic and 5 intestinal cutaneous fistulas with octreotide. Mean decreases in fistula output before octreotide treatment were not significant (p > 0.01 for each group). On the 1st day of octreotide treatment, mean fistula output decreased from 412 +/- 60.4 to 234 +/- 57.7 ml in the biliary, from 457.5 +/- 57.5 to 217.5 +/- 11.8 ml in the pancreatic and from 564 +/- 49.2 to 217.5 +/- 11.8 ml in the enterocutaneous fistula groups (p < 0.01 for each). No serious side effects were recorded. We conclude that octreotide is an important adjunct in the conservative treatment of external biliary, pancreatic and intestinal fistulas, by decreasing their output.", "Microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia: a long-term follow-up study.\nIn this report, we present our experience with microvascular decompression (MVD) as treatment for trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and discuss factors related to recurrence after this procedure. Between 1986 and 2004, 90 patients underwent MVD for treatment of idiopathic TN at the Marmara University Department of Neurosurgery and Marmara University Neurological Sciences Institute. Individuals with atypical and secondary forms of TN were excluded from the study. The patient characteristics, work-up findings, observations during surgery, and results of MVD for the 90 cases are reviewed. In 87 (97%) of the patients, exposure of the pontocerebellar angle revealed a vascular structure compressing the trigeminal nerve. In the patients with vascular compression, the problem vessel was an artery in 80 (92%) cases and a vein in 7 (8%) cases. In 77 cases, all symptoms were completely resolved by the operation. Ten patients experienced significant partial relief, and the intensity of the residual pain in these cases was not severe enough to require medication. Three patients experienced no improvement after MVD. There was no mortality associated with MVD in the 90 cases. The findings for our series of 90 patients with TN who underwent MVD indicate that this operation is an effective and reliable treatment for this condition. We recommend MVD as the first-line surgical approach for patients with TN who do not respond to medical management.", "Non-allergic rhinitis: diagnosis and management.\nPatients in the rhinitis clinic with negative skin prick tests present a challenge. Non-allergic rhinitis consists of a variety of conditions including infection, hormonal changes, drugs and autonomic dysfunction. There is also a range of systemic disorders to be considered. The pathogeneses of many of these are less well understood than that of allergic rhinitis, diagnosis and treatment pathways are also more complex. A detailed accurate history needs to be taken followed by relevant investigations which may include allergen challenge, because skin prick and RAST-negative allergic rhinitis is now recognised. Nitric oxide levels may prove helpful: elevated levels suggest inflammation, very low levels indicate the possibility of primary ciliary dyskinesia or cystic fibrosis. Treatment is of the underlying cause when found: for those without obvious pathology a trial of combined therapy with topical corticosteroids plus antihistamine or plus anti-cholinergic may be worth while. A complex inter-relationship between allergic and infectious rhinitis is becoming apparent.", "Screw fixation in bone of guinea pigs sensitized to nickel and cobalt.\nA screw was inserted transversely through the distal femora and proximal tibiae of guinea pigs sensitized to either Ni or Co. An equal number of nonsensitized animals were treated in the same way. The animals with Ni allergy received an ASIF stainless steel screw and the animals with Co allergy a Howmedica Vitallium screw. After 6 weeks no obvious differences were observed in the histological picture around the femur screws that could be ascribed to metal sensitivity. The mechanical strength of the bone adjacent to the tibial screws was tested by measuring maximum torque during continuous tightening of the screws at a rate of 2 revolution/second. No significant differences in maximum torque resistance were found between sensitized and nonsensitized animals. The results indicate that sensitivity to Ni or Co does not compromise the mechanical fixation between metal and bone during the early period after the implantation.", "Defective renal handling of water in the rat with a portacaval shunt.\nMale rats with a portacaval anastomosis, placed in metabolic cages excreted twice as much urine as unoperated control rats. After subcutaneous injection of one unit of pitressin tannate in oil, the rats on average exhibited a 27% reduction in fluid intake and a 37% reduction in urine volume. Nevertheless the rats still excreted 60% more urine than control rats. Fluid restriction resulted in a reduction in urine volume and an increase in urine osmolality in both groups of rats. Shunted rats, however, continued to excrete 49 ml.kg.(-1)24h-1, while drinking only 43 ml.kg.(-1)24h-1. Owing to the negative water balance plasma osmolality rose by 22 mosm/kg H2O. Two weeks after portacaval anastomosis arterial prostaglandin-E concentrations were 412 ng/1, compared to 158 ng/1 in control rats. The results are consistent with the idea, that the shunt induced diuresis may be due to the renal effects of prostaglandin-E.", "Risk factors for shigellosis in Thailand.\nTo assess the potential risk factors for shigellosis including housefly density. A matched case-control study to investigate potential risk factors for shigellosis was conducted in a semi-urban area, Kaengkhoi District, Saraburi Province, central Thailand. Shigella cases were ascertained from a two-year population-based surveillance study detecting diarrhea and shigellosis in the area. The study evaluated a wide range of exposures, which were assessed by odds ratios (OR) adjusted for proxy markers of socioeconomic status: family income, and type of residence, using conditional logistic regression analysis. Hygiene behaviors such as regular hand washing (p<0.05), a clean environment surrounding the household (p<0.001), and the availability of water to flush the toilet (p=0.08) were associated with a reduced risk for shigellosis in the multivariate model. In contrast factors indicating a lower than average socioeconomic status, such as having to rent instead of owning one's housing (p<0.001) and a low family income (p<0.01) were associated with an increased risk for shigellosis. For children, breastfeeding showed a strong protective effect in reducing the risk of shigellosis (p<0.01). Prior to adjustment for environmental factors, fly density in the kitchen area was associated with an increased risk of shigellosis (p<0.01). We found a correlation between socioeconomic status and the risk for shigellosis. To reduce shigellosis in this setting, we recommend interventions focused on three aspects: improved water supply and sanitation (especially latrines and garbage disposal) including fly control, health education on hand washing, and the promotion of breastfeeding.", "Contrast media-induced ventricular fibrillation: an experimental study of the effects of dimeric contrast media during wedged catheter injection in dogs.\nWe investigated the cardiac effects of an ionic dimer, ioxaglate and two nonionic dimers, iotrolan, and iodixanol. During a simulated wedged catheter situation, 22 ml of each contrast medium was injected into the left anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery in seven open-chested, anesthetized dogs. Of 13 injections with each contrast medium, ioxaglate induced ventricular fibrillation in 11 after 34 +/- 5 sec, iotrolan in 6 after 42 +/- 4 sec, and iodixanol in 3 after 61 +/- 1 sec. Ioxaglate markedly lengthened monophasic action potential duration in contrast medium-perfused myocardium. Iotrolan, and iodixanol induced biphasic changes, first lengthening and then shortening action potential duration. The electrophysiological changes occurred later when using iodixanol. The risk of ventricular fibrillation during long-lasting contrast media exposure to the myocardium, as in a wedged catheter situation, appears to be much lower with iodixanol compared with ioxaglate and also lower than when using iotrolan.", "Portfolio theory and the alternative decision rule of cost-effectiveness analysis: theoretical and practical considerations.\nBridges and Terris (Soc. Sci. Med. (2004)) critique our paper on the alternative decision rule of economic evaluation in the presence of uncertainty and constrained resources within the context of a portfolio of health care programs (Sendi et al. Soc. Sci. Med. 57 (2003) 2207). They argue that by not adopting a formal portfolio theory approach we overlook the optimal solution. We show that these arguments stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of the alternative decision rule of economic evaluation. In particular, the portfolio theory approach advocated by Bridges and Terris is based on the same theoretical assumptions that the alternative decision rule set out to relax. Moreover, Bridges and Terris acknowledge that the proposed portfolio theory approach may not identify the optimal solution to resource allocation problems. Hence, it provides neither theoretical nor practical improvements to the proposed alternative decision rule.", "The synthesis and reaction chemistry of new amino-functionalised tin(II) alkoxides.\nSn(ii) derivatives of the aminoalcohols (t)Bu(H)NC(Me)(H)CH(2)OH (Htbap, ), (R(1)R(2)NCH(2))(2)C(H)OH (R(1) = R(2) = Me, , Hbdmap; R(1) = (t)Bu, R(2) = H, , Hbtbap), (R(1)R(2)NCH(2))(3)COH (R(1) = R(2) = Me, , Htdmap; R(1) = (t)Bu, R(2) = H, , Httbap) have been synthesised by reaction of the alcohol with Sn[N(SiMe(3))(2)](2). The structures of the ligands , .H(2)O, along with Sn(ttbap)(2) have been determined; the latter is pseudo-trigonal bipyramidal with nitrogen atoms in axial sites and oxygen atoms and a stereochemically-active lone pair in the equatorial positions. Sn(ttbap)(2) reacts with Fe(2)(CO)(9) in 2 : 1 ratio (Sn : Fe = 1 : 1) to afford the donor-acceptor complex (ttbap)(2)Sn:-->Fe(CO)(4), while in 1 : 1 ratio (Sn : Fe = 1 : 2) the Sn(0) complex (Httbap)Sn[Fe(CO)(4)](2) is formed, in which Httbap is a neutral zwitterionic form of the ligand. The structures of both bimetallic species are reported. Thermal decomposition of (Httbap)Sn[Fe(CO)(4)](2) under low-pressure CVD conditions gives a film containing a mixture of cubic-Sn, cubic-Fe and the hexagonal intermetallic phase Fe(3)Sn.", "Induction of proliferation and apoptotic cell death via P2Y and P2X receptors, respectively, in rat glomerular mesangial cells.\nCell surface receptors for adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP; P2 receptors) have been subdivided into two families: ligand-gated ion channels (P2X1-7) and G-protein-coupled (P2Y1-8) receptors. We investigated the potential role of P2 receptors on rat glomerular mesangial cells. To investigate cell proliferation, DNA synthesis was assayed by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. For detecting apoptosis, morphological features, DNA fragmentation, and exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outside surface of the cell membrane were investigated. Expression of mRNA and distribution of receptors were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. ATP triggered a dose-dependent increase in DNA synthesis. This response was also induced by uridine triphosphate (UTP), an agonist equipotent with ATP at P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptors; both P2Y2 and P2Y4 mRNA are expressed in glomerular mesangial cells and isolated glomeruli. In contrast, the P2X7 receptor agonist 2'-83'-O-(4-benzoyl benzoyl) ATP (BzATP) caused a decrease in cell number. BzATP produced DNA cleavage and exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outside of the cell membrane. P2X7 receptors were distributed heterogeneously in unstimulated cells. The expression of P2X7 mRNA was maintained at a low level, but was induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Stimulation of glomerular mesangial cells via P2Y2 and/or P2Y4 and via P2X7 receptors can induce proliferation and apoptotic cell death, respectively. The balance between proliferation and apoptosis will depend on the relative stimulation and expression of these P2 receptor subtypes, and could play an important role in normal and abnormal glomerular function.", "Label-free Pb(II) whispering gallery mode sensing using self-assembled glutathione-modified gold nanoparticles on an optical microcavity.\nAn ultrasensitive assay for the detection of Pb(II) has been developed using whispering gallery mode (WGM) sensing. In this technique a photonic microcavity was decorated with glutathione (GSH)-modified gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). The resonator was functionalized using an aminosilane to promote adhesion of the GSH-modified NPs creating a highly sensitive sensor specific to Pb(II). Upon introduction of Pb(II) solutions via a fluidic cell, Pb(II) ions bind to the GSH-Au NP complex and induce a shift of the resonant wavelength. Using this detection strategy we show that we are able to detect Pb(II) concentrations down to 0.05 nM in the presence of alkaline and heavy metal interferences such as Mg(II), Mn(II), Ca(II), Ni(II), Cd(II), Cr(II), Fe(II), and Hg(II). The signal was found to be proportional to the Pb(II) concentration within the range of 2.40-48.26 nM and was found to have an association constant of 2.15 \u00d7 10(5) M(-1) s(-1). The sensitivity obtained shows unparalleled advantages over currently available technology and satisfies the exposure thresholds set out by world organizations such as International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We believe that this sensor has the potential to be made portable for applications in environmental monitoring and in-field applications.", "Solution structure of the TnAn DNA duplex GCCGTTAACGCG containing the HpaI restriction site.\nThe solution structure of the self-complementary DNA duplex [d(GCCGTTAACGGC)]2, which contains the HpaI restriction site GTTAAC, has been elucidated by two-dimensional NMR, distance geometry (DG), and NOE back-calculation methods. Initial distance constraints were determined by polynomial fitting the two-spin initial NOE rates; backbone constraints from NOE and J-coupling observations (Kim et al., 1992) were included. RMSDs between initial-distance-refined structures derived from random-embedded DG, A-DNA, and B-DNA starting structures were all in the range 0.5-1.0 A, indicating good convergence properties of the algorithm, regardless of the starting structure. A semiautomatic back-calculation refinement procedure was developed and used to generate more refined structures for which the BKCALC-simulated NOE volumes matched the experimental data. The six final structures refined from various starting structures exhibit very good agreement with the experimental data (R values = 0.18) and converge well to within 0.8-A RMSD differences for the central 8 base pairs. The torsion and pseudorotation phase angles were found to be well determined by the data, and the local helical parameters for each base step converged quite well. The final structures show that the central T6-A7 step is somewhat underwound (twist angle ca. 29 degrees), with a large negative cup and a normal (wide) minor groove width, while the T5-T6 and A7-A8 steps have a partially narrowed minor groove.", "A second primary esophageal cancer developing 7 years after chemoradiotherapy for advanced esophageal cancer.\nWe report a rare case of advanced carcinoma and a second primary carcinoma of the esophagus, both of which were successfully cured by chemotherapy and operation at different times. In 1991, a 38-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with advanced esophageal cancer, which was unresectable because of the bronchial invasion of the tumor. He was given chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP), combined with radiotherapy. During a 4-year follow-up, neither regrowth of the primary tumor nor distant metastasis occurred. In 1995, esophagoscopy demonstrated a lugol-unstained region located 3 cm distal from the area of radiation to the primary lesion shown by esophagography. Histological examination of a biopsy specimen showed the mucosa to be normal. Nevertheless, yearly surveillance by endoscopy and histological examinations showed that the mucosa of the esophagus gradually began to demonstrate mild dysplasia, followed by severe dysplasia; in 1998, a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma was made. Esophagectomy with lymph node dissection was performed. Microscopic examination revealed that there had been pathologic complete response for the original advanced esophageal cancer.", "Although an association between early age alcohol abuse and deficits in decision-making has been documented the question of whether such traits constitute a predisposing factor to, or a consequence of, alcohol exposure remains open. The long-range goal of this proposal is to assess the effects of voluntary adolescent alcohol intake on choice behavior in a rodent model. Because most strains of rats do not freely consume significant amounts of alcohol in solution, these studies will employ an ethanol gelatin preparation that has been shown to yield high levels of intake. The effects of sustained alcohol exposure during adolescence on future risk behavior will be assessed using a probability-discounting operant task. Preliminary data suggest that, while control animals perform this task near optimally, rats that consumed high levels of alcohol during adolescence demonstrate increases in risk preference and sub-optimal decisions when choice is assessed in adulthood after weeks of alcohol abstinence. Building upon this finding, these studies will identify the timing and duration of adolescent alcohol exposure that contributes to increased incidence of risky decisions, examine the extent of the effect of alcohol exposure on choice behavior and use Fos-like immunohistochemistry to identify potential neural correlates for alcohol induced influence on risky choice. This research aims to expand our current understanding of the potential long-term behavioral and neurobiological effects of early-life alcohol exposure.", "Binge drinking among female Veterans Affairs patients: prevalence and associated risks.\nThis study evaluated the prevalence and associated risks of binge drinking, defined as having > or = 4 drinks on an occasion in the past year, in a female patient population. Of 1,259 female Veterans Affairs patients surveyed, 780 reported drinking alcohol in the past year, and 305 (24% of respondents, 39% of drinkers) reported binge drinking in the past year; 84 (11% of drinkers) had done so monthly or more often. Age-adjusted logistic regression analyses indicated that women who reported past-year binge drinking monthly or more often reported significantly increased odds of morning drinking (odds ratio [OR] = 40.3), others worrying about their drinking (OR = 38.6), arguments after drinking (OR = 13.5), hepatitis or cirrhosis (OR = 3.1), frequent injuries (OR = 2.6), smoking (OR = 3.7), drug use (OR = 22.2), and multiple sexual partners (OR = 4.6).", "[Radiologic aspects of the complications of duodenal diverticula].\nThe duodenum is the second most common site, after the colon, for intestinal diverticulae. This condition is most often asymptomatic and is usually an accidental finding. Complications, with variable clinical presentations, may occur in up to 5% of such individuals. We report a retrospective analysis of 5 patients who presented with complicated duodenal diverticular disease. The complications, either isolated or multiple, consisted of bezoar formation (n = 2), diverticulitis (n = 2), extrinsic compression of the common bile duct (n = 3), perforation (n = 1), choledocholithiasis (n = 1), and an abnormality of the bilio-pancreatic ductal convergence (n = 1). The radiological aspects, in particular, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features are reviewed. These are, to our knowledge, the first descriptions of MRI and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatographic (MRCP) findings in complicated duodenal diverticular disease. MRI facilitates precise delineation of the complicated duodenal diverticulum while MRCP allows assessment of the effects on the biliary and pancreatic ducts.", "[The diagnostic value of ultrasonic elastography and ultrasonography comprehensive score in cervical lesions].\nObjective: To evaluate the clinical value of ultrasonic elastography and ultrasonography comprehensive scoring method in the diagnosis of cervical lesions. Methods: A total of 116 patients were selected from the Department of Gynecology of the first hospital affiliated with Central South University from March 2014 to September 2015.All of the lesions were preoperatively examined by Doppler Ultrasound and elastography.The elasticity score was determined by a 5-point scoring method. Calculation of the strain ratio was based on a comparison of the average strain measured in the lesion with the adjacent tissue of the same depth, size, and shape.All these ultrasonic parameters were quantified, added, and arrived at ultrasonography comprehensive scores.To use surgical pathology as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy of Doppler Ultrasound, elasticity score and strain ratio methods and ultrasonography comprehensive scoring method were comparatively analyzed. Results: (1) The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of Doppler Ultrasound in diagnosing cervical lesions were 82.89% (63/76), 85.0% (34/40), and 83.62% (97/116), respectively.(2) The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the elasticity score method were 77.63% (59/76), 82.5% (33/40), and 79.31% (92/116), respectively; the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the strain ratio measure method were 84.21% (64/76), 87.5% (35/40), and 85.34% (99/116), respectively.(3) The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ultrasonography comprehensive scoring method were 90.79% (69/76), 92.5% (37/40), and 91.38% (106/116), respectively. Conclusion: (1) It was obvious that ultrasonic elastography had certain diagnostic value in cervical lesions. Strain ratio measurement can be more objective than elasticity score method.(2) The combined application of ultrasonography comprehensive scoring method, ultrasonic elastography and conventional sonography was more accurate than single parameter.", "Metal-doped inorganic nanoparticles for multiplex detection of biomarkers by a sandwich-type ICP-MS immunoassay.\nMetal-doped inorganic nanoparticles were synthesized for the multiplex detection of biomarkers by a sandwich-type inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) immunoassay. The synthesized Cs-doped multicore magnetic nanoparticles (MMNPs) were used not only for magnetic extraction of targets but also for ratiometric measurement in ICP-MS. In addition, three different metal/dye-doped silica nanoparticles (SNPs) were synthesized as probes for multiplex detection: Y/RhBITC (rhodamine B isothiocyanate)-doped SNPs for CRP (cardiovascular disease), Cd/RhBITC-doped SNPs for AFP (tumor), and Au/5(6)-XRITC (X-rhodamine-5-(and-6)-isothiocyanate)-doped SNPs for NSE (heart disease). For quantification, the doped metals of SNPs were measured by ICP-MS and then the signal ratio to Cs of MMNPs was plotted with respect to the concentration of targets by a ratiometry. Limits of detection (LOD) of 0.35 ng/mL to 77 ng mL(-1) and recoveries of 83%-125% were obtained for serum samples spiked with the biomarkers. Since no sample treatment was necessary prior to the extraction, the proposed method provided short analysis time and convenience for the multiplex determination of biomarkers, which will be valuable for clinical application.", "Diagnosis of lateral hypopharyngeal pouches: a comparative study of videofluorography and pseudovalsalva maneuver in double contrast pharyngography.\nTo evaluate the difference between the pseudovalsalva maneuver in double-contrast pharyngography and the videofluorographic swallowing examination in the detection and grading of lateral hypopharyngeal pouches. Two hundred twenty-seven videofluorographic swallowing examinations and double-contrast pharyngography using the pseudovalsalva maneuver were retrospectively analyzed by two radiologists. The mean age of the patients was 54 years (range = 21-81 years). The examination was performed on a fluoroscopy unit with a U-matic videorecording system in standard projections. Iodinated contrast agent was used, followed by barium if there was no massive aspiration. In contrast to the videofluorographic swallowing examination, which showed 170 lateral hypopharyngeal pouches (113 grade I, 39 grade II, 18 grade III) in 101 patients, the pseudovalsalva maneuver showed 304 pouches (304 grade III) in 179 patients. No videofluorographically diagnosed lateral hypopharyngeal pouches were missed by the pseudovalsalva maneuver; 134 pouches in 78 patients diagnosed with pseudovalsalva maneuver had no correlation videofluorographically. Double-contrast pharyngography using the pseudovalsalva maneuver is not a reliable method for the diagnosis of lateral hypopharyngeal pouches.", "Effects of prophylactic irradiation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the central nervous system of children.\nThe development of prophylactic therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the central nervous system in children has resulted in an improvement of the prognosis and prolongation of patients' lives. On the other hand, late irradiation effects have increased with the improvement of the prognosis. Therefore, there is now an important need to lessen these late effects without deteriorating the prognosis. We have investigated the recurrence rate, the survival rate and the cause of death of ALL patients who were divided into a none prophylactic irradiation group and 15 Gy, 20 Gy and 24 Gy irradiation groups. The results show that the effect of prophylactic irradiation has been more effective in the 20 Gy group than that of the 24 Gy group. Furthermore, brain atrophy and leukoencephalopathy, which were investigated by X-ray CT in long-term survivors of post-prophylactic irradiation without recurrence, have been less in the 20 Gy group than in that of the 24 Gy group. This report presents the result that the most favorable dose for prophylactic irradiation for central nervous system leukemia of ALL in children is 20 Gy by a step-up method.", "Affective Disposition and the Letter of Reference.\nThe present study attempted to determine the relationship between affective disposition and the favorability of letters of reference. We hypothesized that individuals with positive dispositions would write more favorable letters than would individuals with less positive or neutral dispositions. In addition, we also hypothesized that length of letter would partly mediate the relationship between affective disposition and letter favorability. To test these hypotheses, two studies were conducted. In order to present letter writers with a controlled stimulus, Study 1 entailed having 110 undergraduate students write letters of reference for two hypothetical job candidates in a laboratory setting. In order to test the generalizability of the laboratory study, Study 2 involved 95 faculty members who submitted three recent letters of reference they had written. Results showed that affective disposition was related to the favorability of letters of reference in both studies. Results also revealed that length of letter partly mediated the relationship between affective disposition and letter favorability. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.", "Transcranial direct-current stimulation reduced the excitability of diaphragmatic corticospinal pathways whatever the polarity used.\nWe investigated effects of transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) on the diaphragmatic corticospinal pathways in healthy human. Anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS were randomly applied upon the left diaphragmatic motor cortex in twelve healthy right-handed men. Corticospinal pathways excitability was assessed by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) elicited motor-evoked-potential (MEP). For each tDCS condition, MEPs were recorded before (Pre) tDCS then after 10 min (Post1, at tDCS discontinuation in the anodal and cathodal sessions) and 20 min (Post2). As result, both anodal and cathodal tDCS significantly decreased MEP amplitude of the right hemidiaphragm at both Post1 and Post2, versus Pre. MEP amplitude was unchanged versus Pre during the sham condition. The effects of cathodal and anodal tDCS applied to the diaphragm motor cortex differ from those observed during tDCS of the limb motor cortex. These differences may be related to specific characteristics of the diaphragmatic corticospinal pathways as well as to the diaphragm's functional peculiarities compared with the limb muscles.", "One executive function never comes alone: monitoring and its relation to working memory, reasoning, and different executive functions.\nMonitoring is involved in many daily tasks and is described in several theoretical approaches of executive functioning. This study investigated the relative relationship of cognitive processes that are theoretically relevant to monitoring, such as concept formation, reasoning, working memory, and general cognitive control functions. Data from 699 participants who performed the Balanced Switching Task, aiming at capturing monitoring, were used. Subsamples also performed standard tasks assessing the processes assumed to be related to monitoring. Structural equation modeling revealed that general cognitive control processes are particularly relevant. They mediate the relationship between working memory, reasoning, and monitoring. Updating and maintaining information, as well as concluding from information which strategies can guide behavior toward predefined goals, is required for the ability to exert general cognitive control, which again may be relevant for implementing strategies in a goal-directed way. Together, these processes seem to be necessary to adequately monitor behavior in complex tasks.", "Membrane-Permeable Mn(III) Complexes for Molecular Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Intracellular Targets.\nIntracellular compartments make up roughly two-thirds of the body, but delivery of molecular imaging probes to these spaces can be challenging. This situation is particularly true for probes designed for detection by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a high-resolution but relatively insensitive modality. Most MRI contrast agents are polar and membrane impermeant, making it difficult to deliver them in sufficient quantities for measurement of intracellular analytes. Here we address this problem by introducing a new class of planar tetradentate Mn(III) chelates assembled from a 1,2-phenylenediamido (PDA) backbone. Mn(III)-PDA complexes display T1 relaxivity comparable to that of Gd(III)-based contrast agents and undergo spontaneous cytosolic localization via defined mechanisms. Probe variants incorporating enzyme-cleavable acetomethoxy ester groups are processed by intracellular esterases and accumulate in cells. Probes modified with ethyl esters preferentially label genetically modified cells that express a substrate-selective esterase. In each case, the contrast agents gives rise to robust T1-weighted MRI enhancements, providing precedents for the detection of intracellular targets by Mn(III)-PDA complexes. These compounds therefore constitute a platform from which to develop reagents for molecular MRI of diverse processes inside cells.", "Functional expression of 5-HT2A receptor in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells.\nIn the previous study, we reported the gene expression for proteins related to the function of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) and elucidated the expression patterns of 5-HT(2) receptor subtypes in mouse osteoblasts. In the present study, we evaluated the possible involvement of 5-HT receptor subtypes and its inactivation system in MC3T3-E1 cells, an osteoblast cell line. DOI, a 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptor selective agonist, as well as 5-HT concentration-dependently increased proliferative activities of MC3T3-E1 cells in their premature period. This effect of 5-HT on cell proliferation were inhibited by ketanserin, a 5-HT(2A) receptor specific antagonist. Moreover, both DOI-induced cell proliferation and phosphorylation of ERK1 and 2 proteins were inhibited by PD98059 and U0126, selective inhibitors of MEK in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment with fluoxetine, a 5-HT specific re-uptake inhibitor which inactivate the function of extracellular 5-HT, significantly increased the proliferative activities of MC3T3-E1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Our data indicate that 5-HT fill the role for proliferation of osteoblast cells in their premature period. Notably, 5-HT(2A) receptor may be functionally expressed to regulate mechanisms underlying osteoblast cell proliferation, at least in part, through activation of ERK/MAPK pathways in MC3T3-E1 cells.", "[Early infancy onset of type 1A diabetes mellitus in dizygotic twins: association with genetic and environmental factors].\nThe onset of type 1A diabetes before the first year of age is a rare condition and is probably due to an interaction between genetic and environmental factors (infection), which, together, may explain such an early event. Studies say that about 15% of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic patients had human Cytomegalovirus (CMV) specific viral genome in their lymphocytes. We report two cases of dizygotic twins with type 1 diabetes onset in their first 9 months of age, with genetic homogeneity (for HLA DR3/DR4 alleles), a history of CMV infection (positive IgG and urinary PCR) and positive antibody anti-GAD (9.6 UI/ml), present only in the second twin. Although they were dizygotic twins, which concordance rate is 3.8%, they assume the equivalent risk as monozygotic (40%) as they have similar high risk genotype (HLA) for type 1 diabetes. We believe that both time concordance and also the early onset of diabetes are due to an association between infection and the high genetic liability.", "Cautious gait in relation to knowledge and vision of height: is altered visual information the dominant influence?\nFor some people, visual exposure creates difficulty with movement and balance, yet the mechanisms causing this are poorly understood. The altered visual environment is an obvious possible cause of degraded balance. We studied locomotion in normal healthy adults along a 22-cm-wide walkway at ground level and at a height of 3.5 m. This produced substantial changes in gait progression (velocity reduced by 0.34 ms(-1), P <0.01), proportion of time spent in double support more than doubled (P <0.01), and galvanic skin conductance, a measure of physiological arousal, increased significantly (P <0.01). Since increasing visual distance is known to destabilize balance, our primary question was whether the disturbing effects of height could be eliminated by replacing sight of the drop with a visual surround comparable to ground level while retaining the danger and knowledge of the risk. Removing visual exposure did not significantly change the gait progression (P = 0.65) or double support duration (P = 0.58) but produced a small, significant reduction in physiological arousal (P = 0.04). In response to postural threat, knowledge of danger rather than current visual environment was the dominant cause of cautious gait and elevated physiological arousal in response to postural threat. We conclude that the mechanisms disturbing locomotion, balance, and autonomic response occur at a high task level which integrates cognition and prior experience with sensory input.", "Multiple-dose arecoline infusions in Alzheimer's disease.\nTwelve patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type received two-hour infusions of placebo and the muscarinic cholinergic agonist arecoline hydrobromide at rates of 1, 2, and 4 mg/h in a double-blind, randomized fashion. These infusions resulted in dose-dependent physiologic and neuroendocrine effects consistent with central cholinergic stimulation. Infusions were generally well tolerated. No statistically significant improvement in performance on most cognitive tasks assessing knowledge memory and episodic learning and memory was observed at any dose, although marginal improvement in picture recognition ability and in ratings of word-finding were observed at the lower doses. Psychomotor activation and slightly improved affect were reliably observed at the lower doses, whereas increasing psychomotor retardation was observed at the highest dose. The data support a role for central cholinergic modulation of some aspects of cognition, behavior, and affect in this population. The apparent greater behavioral sensitivity of patients with Alzheimer's disease in comparison with subject populations previously studied, as well as the altered dose responsiveness, merit further study in relationship to normal aging.", "Clinical Evaluation of All Ceramic Zirconia Framework Resin Bonded Bridges.\nTo evaluate the clinical longevity of 58 adhesively bonded single unit yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline (Y-TZP) ceramic Resin Bonded Bridges (RBB). Twenty six consecutive patients with at least one congenitally missing tooth in the maxilla or mandible were provided with 58 single unit Y-TZP RBBs. The cantilever RBBs were designed and milled using a CAD-CAM system to produce frameworks which were veneered using a glass-ceramic material and cemented with a self-etching dual-cure resin cement. Following a mean follow up period of 36.2 months (maximum 62.3 months, minimum 25.4 months), 48 restorations remain in service with a survival rate of 82.7%. One anterior retainer fracture was encountered and no fractures of the posterior framework or ceramic were noted within the time frame reported. All ceramic Y-TZP RBBs replacing maxillary and mandibular teeth in the anterior and posterior areas demonstrated an 82.7% Kaplan Meier survival rate over 3 years, which was comparable to previously published survival rates for the non-perforated metal framework RBBs. Replacement of anterior or posterior teeth using single unit cantilevered RBBs using Y-TZP ceramics should be considered a viable restorative option with a high survival rate.", "Intracellular trafficking and metabolic turnover of yeast prepro-alpha-factor-SRIF precursors in GH3 cells.\nChimeric genes coding for prepro region of yeast alpha-factor and anglerfish SRIF were expressed in rat GH3 cells to determine whether yeast signals could regulate hormone processing in mammalian cells. We report that nascent hybrid polypeptides were efficiently targeted to ER, where cleavage of signal peptides and core glycosylation occurred, and were localized mainly in Golgi. These data indicate that prepro region of yeast alpha-factor functions in sorting molecules to secretory pathway in mammalian cells. A hybrid construct with a mutated signal peptide underwent similar ER translocation, whereas such a mutation resulted in defective translocation in yeast (Cheong et al., 1997). This difference may be due to the differences in ER translocation between yeast and mammalian cells, i.e., posttranslational versus cotranslational translocation. Processing and secretion of metabolically labeled hybrid propeptides to mature SRIF peptides were assessed by HPLC. When pulse-labeled cells were chased for up to 2 h, intracellular propeptides disappeared with a half-life of approximately 25 min, showing that approximately 68% of initially synthesized propeptides were secreted constitutively. About 22% of SRIF-related products were proteolytically processed to mature SRIF, of which 38.7% were stored intracellularly with a half-life of approximately 2 h. In addition, immunocytochemical localization showed that a small proportion of SRIF molecules accumulated in secretory vesicles. All these results suggest that yeast prepropeptide could direct hybrid precursors to translocate into ER lumen and transit through secretory pathway to the distal elements of Golgi compartment, but could process and target it less efficiently to downstream in rat endocrine cells.", "Gastroesophageal reflux in children with recurrent abdominal pain.\nIn this study we investigated the presence of gastroesophageal reflux in children with recurrent abdominal pain and its possible relationship to food intolerance-associated duodenal inflammation. Twenty-four-hour intra-esophageal pH monitoring, an endoscopic duodenal biopsy and a small bowel 51Cr-EDTA permeability test were performed in 25 children with recurrent abdominal pain. In 14 cases (56%) the pH monitoring was abnormal, pointing to the presence of pathological gastroesophageal reflux. Treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in the latter patients resulted in resolution or improvement of abdominal pain in 10 cases (71%). Gastroesophageal reflux did not appear to be associated with either intestinal permeability to 51Cr-EDTA or duodenal biopsy findings. We conclude that pathological gastroesophageal reflex is a frequent finding in children with recurrent abdominal pain, that it is unrelated to duodenal inflammation and that there might be a causal relationship between pathological gastroesophageal reflux and recurrent abdominal pain in children.", "Comparison of effects of 3 and 7% hypertonic saline nebulization on lung function in children with cystic fibrosis: a double-blind randomized, controlled trial.\nBeneficial effects of hypertonic saline on lung function in cystic fibrosis patients are well documented. However, the effects of various concentrations of hypertonic saline are not well studied. We, therefore, compared the effects of 3 and 7% hypertonic saline administered by nebulization on lung function in children with cystic fibrosis. In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 31 children with cystic fibrosis were randomized to receive either 3% saline or 7% saline nebulization twice daily for 28 days. Spirometry was performed and functional status was measured on Day 14 and 28. Of 31 children enrolled in the study, 30 completed the 28 days follow up (15 in each group). Percentage change in Forced Expiratory Volume during first second (FEV(1)) from baseline to Day 14 and on Day 28 was significantly higher in the group receiving 3% saline as compared with those receiving 7% saline inhalation. There was some decrease in FEV(1) (percentage predicted) immediately after 7% saline inhalation unlike 3% saline. The functional status remained comparable between the two groups. The results suggest that 3% hypertonic saline nebulization was better than 7% saline inhalation. There is a need for studies with larger sample size and longer duration to confirm our results.", "Non invasive study of left ventricular function in chronic renal failure before and after hemodialysis.\nEight patients with chronic renal failure, who were on chronic hemodialysis were studied. The systolic time intervals were measured from simultaneous recordings of the electrocardiogram, phonocardiogram and carotid arterial pulse tracing. The ventricular volumes and stroke volume were calculated from echocardiographic recordings. The following indices of contractility were derived from the echocardiographic traces - the mean circumferential fiber shortening rate (mean VCF), and mean posterior wall velocity (PWV), mean normalized posterior wall velocity (VPW), and mean normalized interventricular septal velocity (VIVS). The studies were performed immediately before and after a routine dialysis. All the patients had abnormal end diastolic volumes in the basal state. After dialysis the end diastolic volume, stroke volume and left ventricular ejection time were reduced significantly. These changes in cardiac pump function reflect the post dialysis reduction of blood volume. The values for the contractility indices all improved after dialysis and this change correlates well with the abbreviation of left ventricular ejection time (r = .92). It is concluded that the main effects of dialysis are on pump function, and although the changes in the normalized velocities may indicate a real improvement in contractility, their validity is limited by their dependence on left ventricular load conditions and ejection time. Echocardiographic determination of ejection fraction and mitral valve E point - septal separation are suggested as reliable indices of cardiac pump function.", "[Ultrasound guided breast biopsy--a retrospective study and literature review].\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy and clinical usefulness of ultrasound guided core biopsy for diagnosing suspicious radiologically detected breast lesions. We retrospectively evaluated the results of percutaneous core biopsy with 14-gauge needles performed over a period of 14 months on 229 suspicious lesions detectable on mammography and/or ultrasound exam (BI-RADS 4 or 5). The imaging-histological concordance was ascertained for each lesion. In cases of discordance, repeat biopsy or surgical excision was performed. Six-month ultrasound control was recommended in cases of benign lesions. For borderline and malignant lesions a surgical excision was done. Concordance between biopsy results and subsequent examinations (surgical excision or follow-up) was also evaluated. Histological analysis of core biopsy samples showed 143 (62.4%) benign lesions, 21 (9.2%) borderline lesions and 65 (28.4%) malignant lesions. Follow-up, repeated biopsy, or surgical excision showed four false negative cases. Accuracy of ultrasound guided core biopsy was 98.3%. Ultrasound guided core biopsy is a safe and reliable method for diagnosing suspicious breast lesions without any significant complications as was reported in previous studies.", "Prevalence and risk factors for diabetes mellitus in a selected urban population of a city in Punjab.\nTo estimate the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (diagnosed and undiagnosed), impaired fasting glucose and possible risk factors for diabetes mellitus among Pakistani population. This cross sectional study was performed in Rawalpindi which is one of the cities in Northern Punjab of Pakistan in July 2008. An area was selected in Rawalpindi city, with mixed population representative of almost all provinces with different socioeconomic groups. Three hundred and thirteen houses were selected through systematic random sampling technique and fasting blood glucose was obtained and subjects were labeled to have diabetes according to WHO criteria of diagnosing diabetes mellitus. The statistical analysis was performed by using Stata version 10. There were 1091 respondents who were selected after cleaning the data, among them 293 were males and 798 were females. Of the total 15.41% of the males and 12.31% of females were found to have diabetes mellitus. Thus making a total prevalence of 13.14%. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was found in 5.14% males and 5.78% females making a total prevalence of 5.61%. Over all (DM & IFG) was found to be 20.55% in males and 18.09% in females. The main risk factors identified were obesity, family history, hypertension and increasing age. There is an increased prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in Pakistan and main risk factors identified were obesity, overweight, family history of diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.", "In comparison with reciprocating and rotary engines, gas turbine engines offer significant benefits in terms of small size and light weight. In terms of fuel economy, however, gas turbine engines have lagged behind the other engines, particularly for the small engine sizes. Gas turbine engines have also been considerably more expensive, mainly due to intricate designs, close manufacturing tolerances, and the use of exotic materials. Data as to many of these prior art engines are found in \"The Aircraft Gas Turbine Engine And Its Operation,\" United Technologies (Pratt and Whitney), 1988; and \"Aircraft Gas Turbine Guide,\" (General Electric (Aircraft Engine Group), 1980.\nMy gas turbine engines have a smaller size and lesser weight than current turbine engines having the same power. Consequently, they provide less weight for the same power or more power for the same weight as prior engines. As a result, they offer greater range or flying power and savings in fuel consumption, initial cost, and maintenance.", "A signal amplification probe enhances sensitivity of antibodies and aptamers based Immuno-diagnostic assays.\nOne major unmet need is improving the sensitivity of immune-diagnostic assays. This is particularly important in the field of biomarker discoveries and monitoring. We have established a novel signal amplification probe system enabling a highly sensitive target detection platform to be used in immuno-assays. The probe consists of a double stranded DNA that can carry a large number of signaling elements such as biotin or fluorescent molecules. The DNA probe anchors to the recognition unit, whether an antibody or an aptamer, by covalent conjugation or by a simple and rapid molecular association process. Binding curves obtained by using the DNA amplification probe are dose dependent and linear over a wide range of antigen concentration. The optimal slopes are characterized by high signals and low background increasing the assay sensitivity and reducing the limit of detection by up to 10-fold compared to biotinylated antibodies commonly used in ELISA systems. When using aptamers in combination with the amplification probe for antigen recognition, the limit of detection is comparable to that obtained by biotinylated antibodies. Biotin labeled aptamers practically cannot be used for detection of low target levels. The DNA amplification probe system enables to expand the range of diagnostic assays including clinical samples and meet research needs.", "The long-term objective of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic transmission from photoreceptors to second-order neurons in the vertebrate retina. This problem is being studied in the retina of the tiger salamander, principally through the use of electrophysiological and pharmacological techniques. During the next grant period, the focus will be on the role of chloride and hydrogen ions in shaping the light responses of photoreceptors and horizontal cells and in modulating signal transfer between these cells. The specific aims are: (1) to measure the activities of chloride and hydrogen ions in photoreceptors and horizontal cells through intracellular recording from these cells in the intact retina with double-barrel Cl-sensitive and pH-sensitive microelectrodes as well as through optical recording from isolated cells with the fluorescent pH indicator BCECF, with the objective to determine whether chloride is distributed passively or is pumped actively in these neurons, (2) to measure extracellular pH in the outer retina in various physiological states, with the objective to determine whether there are significant activity-dependent pH changes which might modulate neuronal function, (3) to uncover the mechanism(s) involved in regulating internal chloride levels in photoreceptors and horizontal cells, and in particular, to use specific pharmacological blockers and the method of acid challenge to test for the presence of the major known chloride pumps, C1/HCO3 exchange and Na/K/2C1 cotransport, in these cells, and (4) to clarify the specific functions of chloride conductances in photoreceptors and horizontal cells through experiments which alter the movement of chloride ions across the plasma membrane such as chloride substitution and the application of chloride channel blockers and chloride transport blockers.", "[The value of soft tissue neurogenic tumors in the extremities with 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging].\nTo explore the diagnostic value of 3.0T MRI in neurogenic tumor of soft tissue in the extremities. The MRI appearance of 17 neurogenic tumors with pathological confirmation was retrospectively analyzed. Various imaging characteristics of tumors were evaluated and different imaging findings were compared. The diagnosis value of each MRI features was evaluated with receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) analysis. In the benign tumors significant differences between neurilemmoma and neurofibromas were noted for the position (P = 0.044). Heterogenicity on T(2)-weighted fat suppression images was also significant in differentiating between neurilemmoma and neurofibromas ( P = 0.020) . The shape of tumors, maximum length of tumor short diameter, edem around masses, relationship with adjoining fascia had the best discriminatory ability. The ROC analysis yield the area under curve (AUC) of them was 0.967 (P = 0.037), 0.923 (P = 0.048) , 0.981 (P = 0.034) , 0.981 (P = 0.034), respectively. If the neurogenic tumors of soft tissue in the extremities had one or several features of these characteristics (irregular margin, big volume, edem around masses, aggressive behavior with adjoining fascia) on 3.0T MRI, they had more possibility to be malignant. T(2)-weighted fat suppression series on 3.0TMRI was very important for discrimination of tumor histological characteristics.", "A variety of processes are performed in the fabrication of semiconductor devices. For example, deposition processes are performed in the fabrication of some semiconductor devices to form a layer or film of an oxide or other material. Deposition processes may be carried out on a batch of semiconductor wafers, as opposed to depositing the layers on wafers one at a time. The batch of wafers that are exposed to a particular deposition process may include production wafers, which are the wafers on which the semiconductor devices are formed, and may also include dummy wafers. The dummy wafers are sometimes included in a batch of wafers so that uniform deposition on the production wafers of oxides or other materials can be achieved, e.g., the dummy wafers may be included in order to provide a desired number of total wafers in the batch, for example, in a case where less than a full batch of production wafers are available for processing and the processing is sensitive to the number/load of wafers being processed. The dummy wafers are thus subjected to the same deposition of material as are the production wafers; however, the dummy wafers do not typically proceed to further processing steps in the production of the semiconductor devices. Rather, the dummy wafers are typically discarded after a certain number of uses, or after the dummy wafers have accumulated a certain thickness of the deposited material. Discarding dummy wafers increases the costs of producing the production wafers.", "[Terminal renal failure caused by interstitial nephritis following mushroom poisoning by Cortinarius speciocissimus].\nA 14 year old boy was admitted for vomiting, anorexia, flank pain and leukocyturia/hematuria. Shortly after admission, he developed anuria and acute renal failure so that hemodialysis had to be started. Pre- and post-renal causes were excluded. There were no signs of acute glomerulonephritis; liver enzymes were normal. The 123Iodine-Hippuran scan showed a shock kidney pattern lacking tubular clearance. Renal biopsy revealed an interstitial nephritis with edema and a mixed cellular infiltration. History was empty for nephrotoxic agents except for mushroom ingestion: Five days before admission the boy ate Cortinarius speciocissimus mushrooms, the toxine of which is known to be nephrotoxic, causing irreversible renal failure in severe cases (Orellanus Syndrome). Renal function did not improve much and renal transplantation was performed after 14 months on hemodialysis. In interstitial nephritis of unknown etiology the possibility of mushroom poisoning should be considered.", "Lipoprotein(a) as a risk factor for calcific aortic valvulopathy in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.\nA large number of epidemiological studies in ethnically diverse populations show that lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels above 30-50 mg/dL are significantly associated with calcific aortic valve stenosis, although less so in African Americans. Patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (he-FH) have a marked lifelong elevation of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level, and the prevalence of aortic valve calcification (AVC) is at least two-fold higher among adult he-FH patients compared with healthy controls. Additionally, Lp(a) levels above 50 mg/dL were recently found to be an independent risk factor for AVC among asymptomatic statin-treated he-FH patients. Given that worldwide an estimated 1.4 billion people have an Lp(a) level over 50 mg/dL, and that one out of 250 individuals has he-FH, then globally about 5 million he-FH patients should have an Lp(a) level higher than 50 mg/dL. However, because Lp(a) levels are, on average, significantly higher in he-FH patients than the general population, the actual number of he-FH patients with such high Lp(a) levels must be even higher. We proposed recently that Lp(a) life-years is a useful metric of cumulative burden of risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and now posit that this metric may be extended to the development of AVC. The Lp(a) life-years illustrates the age-dependent exposure to a given Lp(a) level (years x mg/dL). Effective novel pharmacotherapies using apo(a) antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based therapies targeting the hepatic expression of apo(a) offer unprecedented potential for significant reduction in the cumulative exposure of the aortic valves to Lp(a), and need to be tested in controlled clinical trials on the progression of AVC.", "Endogenous brain cytokine mRNA and inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide are elevated in the Tg2576 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.\nBeta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques have been shown to induce inflammatory changes in Alzheimer's disease brains. Cortical, but not cerebellar tissue from 16-month-old Tg2576 (Tg+) mice showed significant increases in interleukin (IL)-1alpha (2.2-fold), IL-1beta (3.4-fold), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (3.9-fold), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (2.5-fold) mRNA levels compared to controls (Tg-). These changes were not apparent in 6-month-old Tg+ mice except for TNF-alpha. mRNA levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein and complement components, C1qA and C3 were also elevated in aged mice. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (25 microg/mouse, i.v.) induced a significantly greater production of IL-1beta protein in the cortices and hippocampi of Tg+ vs. Tg- mice at 1, 2, 4, and 6 h. Experiments in 6-month-old mice showed that not only was there less cytokine produced compared to 16-month-old mice, but the exacerbated cytokine response to LPS in Tg+ mice was not apparent. Higher levels of Abeta1-40 were measured in the cortices of 6- and 16-month-old Tg+ mice at 4-6 h after LPS, which returned to baseline after 18 h. We demonstrate that Abeta plaques elicit inflammatory responses in Tg2576 mice that are further exacerbated when challenged by an exogenous inflammatory insult, which may serve to amplify degenerative processes.", "Vasoconstrictor mechanisms in the cerebral circulation are unaffected by insulin resistance.\nInsulin-resistance (IR) impairs agonist-induced relaxation in cerebral arteries, but little is known about its effect on constrictor mechanisms. We examined the vascular responses of the basilar artery (BA) and its side branches in anesthetized Zucker lean (ZL) and IR Zucker obese (ZO) rats using a cranial window technique. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) constricted the BAs in both the ZL and ZO rats, but there was no significant difference between the two groups (ZL: 36 +/- 8%; ZO: 33 +/- 3% at 10(-8) M). Inhibition of the ET(A) receptors by BQ-123 slightly increased the diameters of the BAs, with no difference shown between the ZL (6 +/- 1%) and ZO (5 +/- 3%) rats. Expressions of the ET(A) receptors and ET-1 mRNA examined by immunoblot analysis and RT-PCR, respectively, were also similar in the ZL and ZO groups. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), and the thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)) mimetic U-46619 constricted the BAs, but similarly to ET-1, there was no significant difference between the ZL and ZO groups (10(-6) M PDBu: ZL: 33 +/- 2%; ZO: 32 +/- 4%; and 10(-7) M U-46619: ZL: 23 +/- 1%; ZO: 19 +/- 2%). Inhibition of Rho-kinase with Y-27632 induced dilation of the BAs, and these responses were also comparable in the ZL and ZO rats (ZL: 39 +/- 4%; ZO: 38 +/- 2% at 10(-5) M). In contrast, nitric oxide-dependent relaxation to bradykinin was significantly reduced in the ZO rats (10(-6) M: 10 +/- 3%) compared with ZLs (29 +/- 7%, P < 0.01). These findings indicate that vasoconstrictor responses of the BA mediated by ET-1, TxA(2), PKC, and Rho-kinase are not affected by IR.", "Ovarian cancer surgery: health and coping during the perioperative period.\nThe study objective was to survey general health and coping in women undergoing ovarian cancer surgery, and subsequently to develop and test a supportive care intervention. Women who underwent surgery on the suspicion of ovarian cancer participated in a follow-up questionnaire study in which the Short Form-36 Questionnaire was used to survey general health twice during the perioperative period and the Life Orientation Questionnaire (SOC) was used once to define the postoperative coping capacity. An evidence-based, preoperative supportive care programme was subsequently developed and tested. This consisted of lean methodology applied to clinical pathways, preoperative optimisation, and psychosocial care and support. From 294 women allocated to three study groups, a total of 546 Short Form-36 questionnaires and 253 SOC questionnaires were available for analysis. The overall response rate was 86 %. The presence of ascites, a pelvic mass, and a Risk of Malignancy Index >200 proved to be appropriate clinical markers for intensified preoperative care. Concerning physical health, levels were low throughout the perioperative period; the majority however stayed within standard levels. Concerning mental health, levels were below standard during the entire period, but did improve with time, also in women in whom the potential cancer diagnosis was refuted. The preoperative differences between these groups leveled out postoperatively in terms of physical health. At the end of the perioperative period, the coping capacity was close to normal. A need for supportive care during the perioperative period was identified. This should be adjusted to the nature of the disease and the extent of the treatment. Participation in a preoperative supportive programme supported physical health during the perioperative period; however, further support of mental health seemed required.", "Saliva cotinine and thiocyanate: chemical indicators of smokeless tobacco and cigarette use in adolescents.\nRecent attempts to measure smoking behavior using chemical tests may have been confounded by the use of smokeless tobacco. An objective measure of smokeless tobacco use is needed, particularly among adolescents who may not provide accurate self-reports of tobacco usage. Saliva cotinine was used to distinguish self-reported tobacco users from nonusers and a combination of saliva cotinine and thiocyanate (SCN) tests was used to distinguish smokers from smokeless tobacco users. The subjects were 471 students in grades 7 through 11 who lived in a high-tobacco production area. Approximately 89% of reported nonusers had no detectable cotinine and 99% of nonusers had levels less than 25 ng/ml. Of those who had used tobacco within the last 12 hr, 95% had detectable levels of cotinine. Samples that tested positive for cotinine were also tested for SCN. Eighty-six percent of smokers and 74% of mixed users had SCN values of greater than 1000 mumol/liter, while only 14% of smokeless users had SCN values at that level. The combination of cotinine and SCN was effective in distinguishing smokers from smokeless users but was not effective in distinguishing mixed use from the other two types of use.", "FADS genotypes and desaturase activity estimated by the ratio of arachidonic acid to linoleic acid are associated with inflammation and coronary artery disease.\nThe delta-5 and delta-6 desaturases, encoded by FADS1 and FADS2 genes, are key enzymes in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism that catalyze the conversion of linoleic acid (LA) into arachidonic acid (AA) and that of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) into eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FADS1 and FADS2 have been associated with different concentrations of AA and LA, and those associations have possible functional consequences for desaturase activity. We aimed to evaluate the possible association among FADS genotypes, desaturase activity, inflammation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). Thirteen FADS SNPs and the ratio of AA to LA (AA/LA) on red blood cell (RBC) membranes, a marker of desaturase activity, were evaluated in 876 subjects with (n = 610) or without (n = 266) angiographically documented CAD. Both AA/LA and the ratio of EPA to ALA (EPA/ALA) were higher in patients with CAD than in those without CAD, but, in a multiple logistic regression model, only a higher AA/LA resulted an independent risk factor for CAD (odds ratio: 2.55; 95% CI: 1.61, 4.05 for higher compared with lower ratio tertile; P for trend < 0.001). Furthermore, concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein increased progressively across tertiles of AA/LA. Graded increases in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations and CAD risk were related to the carriership of FADS haplotypes, including the alleles associated with a higher ratio. In populations following a Western diet, subjects carrying FADS haplotypes that are associated with higher desaturase activity may be prone to a proinflammatory response favoring atherosclerotic vascular damage.", "Neural correlates of envy: Regional homogeneity of resting-state brain activity predicts dispositional envy.\nEnvy differs from common negative emotions across cultures. Although previous studies have explored the neural basis of episodic envy via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), little is known about the neural processes associated with dispositional envy. In the present study, we used regional homogeneity (ReHo) as an index in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to identify brain regions involved in individual differences in dispositional envy, as measured by the Dispositional Envy Scale (DES). Results showed that ReHo in the inferior/middle frontal gyrus (IFG/MFG) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) positively predicted dispositional envy. Moreover, of all the personality traits measured by the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R), only neuroticism was significantly associated with dispositional envy. Furthermore, neuroticism mediated the underlying association between the ReHo of the IFG/MFG and dispositional envy. Hence, to the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that spontaneous brain activity in multiple regions related to self-evaluation, social perception, and social emotion contributes to dispositional envy. In addition, our findings reveal that neuroticism may play an important role in the cognitive processing of dispositional envy.", "Do bacteria have an electric permanent dipole moment?\nIn the scientific literature in the last 40 years, some data for the permanent dipole moment and the electric polarizability of Escherichia coli can be found [S.P. Stoylov, Colloid Electro-Optics - Theory, Techniques and Application, Academic Press, London, 1991]. In this paper the data based mainly on electro-optic investigation is considered as much as some dipolophoretic (most often called dielectrophoretic) studies. Serious grounds are found to doubt the conclusions made for the electric dipole moments of bacteria by one of the authors of this paper (SPS) and by some other researchers. This concerns both the permanent dipole moment and the electric charge dependent polarizabilities of E. coli. Here, along with the discussion of the old experimental data, new experimental data are shown for a strain of E. coli HB101. The conclusions from the analysis of the old and the new experimental data is that they do not provide correct evidence for the presence of a permanent dipole moment. It seems that all statements for the existence of electric permanent dipole moment in bacteria [S.P. Stoylov, Colloid Electro-Optics - Theory, Techniques and Application, Academic Press, London, 1991; S.P. Stoylov, S. Sokerov, I. Petkanchin, N. Ibroshev, Dokl. AN URSS 180 (1968) 1165; N.A.

Dukhin (Ed.), Electro-optics of Colloids, Naukova Dumka, Kiev, 1977 (in Russian).] based on electro-optic studies are result of incorrect interpretation. Therefore, they should be further ignored.", "[Research activities and research interest among female general practitioners. Why so few, when so many are interested?].\n331 (54%) of Norways 609 female general practitioners responded to a questionnaire about their research experience, interest in research on general practice and the barriers experienced to doing research. 41 were actively engaged in research, five at a Ph D level. 38 had completed research earlier. 27 had collected material without publishing any results and were not actively engaged in research at the time of the investigation. 223 were interested in doing research if the conditions could be adapted to their needs. Half the respondents regarded caring for the family and professional strains at work as barriers to research. It is necessary to systematically recruit female general practitioners to research in order to enrich research on general practice by female perspectives and experience, and in order to influence the development of methods and the areas of research.", "Alkylation-induced apoptosis of embryonic stem cells in which the gene for DNA-repair, methyltransferase, had been disrupted by gene targeting.\nAn enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) catalyzes transfer of a methyl group from O6-methylguanine and O4-methylthymine of alkylated DNA to its own molecule, thereby repairing the pre-mutagenic lesions in a single step reaction. Making use of gene targeting, we developed mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell lines deficient in the methyltransferase. Quantitative immunoblot analysis and enzyme assay revealed that MGMT-/- cells, in which both alleles were disrupted, contained no methyltransferase protein while cells with one intact allele (MGMT+/-) contained about half the amount of protein carried by the parental MGMT+/+ cells. MGMT-/- cells have an extremely high degree of sensitivity to simple alkylating agents, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), whereas MGMT+/- cells are slightly more sensitive to these agents, as compared with findings from normal cells. A high frequency of mutation was induced in MGMT-/- cells on exposure to a relatively low dose of MNNG. Electrophoretic analyses of the DNAs as well as fluorochrome staining of the cells revealed that MGMT-/- cells treated with MNNG undergo apoptotic death, which occurs after G2-M arrest in the second cycle of cell proliferation.", "Knowledge-based modeling of a bacterial dichloromethane dehalogenase.\nA three-dimensional structural model of the dichloromethane dehalogenase (DCMD) from Methylophilus sp. DM11 is constructed based on sequence similarities to the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). To maximize sequence identity and minimize gaps in the alignment, a hybrid approach is used that takes advantage of the increased homology found between DM11 and domain I of the sheep blowfly theta class GST (residues 1-79) and domain II of the human alpha class GST (residues 81-222). The resulting structure has C alpha root mean square deviations of 1.16 A in domain I and 1.83 A in domain II from the template GSTs, which compare well to those seen in other GST inter-class comparisons. The model is further applied to explore the structural basis for substrate binding and catalysis. A conserved network of hydrogen bonds is described that binds glutathione to the G site, placing the thiol group in a suitable location for nucleophilic attack of dichloromethane. A mechanism is proposed that involves activation through a hydrogen bond interaction between Ser12 and glutathione, similar to that found in the theta-GSTs. The model also demonstrates how aromatic residues in the hydrophobic site (H site) could play a role in promoting catalysis: His116 and Trp117 are ideally situated to accept a growing negative charge on a chlorine of dichloromethane, stabilizing displacement. This scheme is consistent with experimental results of single-point mutations and comparisons with other GST structures and mechanisms.", "Transdermal iontophoretic delivery of timolol maleate in albino rabbits.\nThe use of transdermal iontophoresis is a promising technique for the systemic delivery of water soluble and ionic drugs of relatively large molecular size. The present study investigates the skin pre-treatment with Azone (laurocapram) and iontophoresis on the pharmacodynamic effect of timolol maleate (TM) in vivo in albino rabbits. The pharmacodynamic effect of TM was evaluated by transdermal delivery and compared with an intravenous (i.v.) administration. Iontophoresis of TM (0.1 mg/ml) produced a significant inhibition in the isoprenaline (ISP)-induced tachycardia. Iontophoresis with higher concentration of TM (1 mg/ml) produced a 100% inhibition of the ISP induced tachycardia. Pre-treatment of skin with Azone (3% v/v emulsion) eliminated the lag time and prolonged the duration of action of iontophoresis from 4 to 6 h. The AUC of Azone treated group was significantly higher than that of the untreated group (P<0.05). Further, the AUC with iontophoretic delivery and pre-treatment of Azone was comparable to that of intravenous TM (30 microg/kg). In conclusion, iontophoresis in combination with Azone can increase the transdermal delivery of TM, whereby the required transport rate can be achieved with a lower drug concentration.", "Automatic measurement of changes in brain volume on consecutive 3D MR images by segmentation propagation.\nThis article presents a technique to automatically measure changes in the volume of a structure of interest in successive 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images and its application in the study of the brain and lateral cerebral ventricles. The only manual step is a segmentation of the structure of interest in the first image. The analysis comprises, first, precise rigid co-registration of the time series of images; second, computation of residual deformations between pairs of images; third, automatic quantification of the volume change, obtained by propagation of the segmentation of the structure of interest through the series of MR images. This approach has been applied to monitor changes in the volume of the brain and lateral cerebral ventricles in a healthy subject and a patient with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Results are consistent with those obtained by application of the boundary shift integral (BSI) and by stereology in the same subjects.", "[Molecular mechanisms of autophagy in regulating renal aging and interventional effects of Chinese herbal medicine].\nAging is the gradual functional recession of the living tissues or organs caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors together. Autophagy is a process of degrading cytoplasmic components mediated by lysosomes in eukaryotic cells. Kidney is a typical target organ of aging. Autophagy regulates renal aging. Decrease in autophagy can accelerate renal aging,whereas,increase in autophagy can delay renal aging. During the process of regulating renal aging,the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its related signaling pathways including the adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mTOR,the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/ serine-threonine kinase(Akt)/mTOR,the AMPK/silent information regulation 1 (Sirt1) and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) play the important roles in renal aging. Regulating the key signaling molecules in these pathways in vivo can control renal aging. Some Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) and their extracts with the effects of nourishing kidney or activating stasis, such as Cordyceps sinensis, curcumin and resveratrol have the beneficial effects on renal aging and/or autophagy. Therefore,revealing the pharmacological effects of CHM in anti-renal aging based on the molecular mechanisms of autophagy will become one of the development trends in the future study.", "The role of mannose binding lectin on fever episodes in pediatric oncology patients.\nDespite significant changes in pediatric oncological therapy, mortality is still high, mainly due to infections. Complement system as an ancient immune defense against microorganisms plays a significant role in surmounting infections, therefore, deficiency of its components may have particular importance in malignancies. The present paper assesses the effect of promoter (X/Y) and exon 1 (A/0) polymorphisms of the MBL2 gene altering mannose binding lectin (MBL) serum level in pediatric oncological patients with febrile neutropenia. Furthermore, frequency distribution of MBL2 alleles in children with malignancies and age-matched controls was analysed. Fifty-four oncohematological patients and 53 children who had undergone pediatric surgery were enrolled into this retrospective study. No significant differences were found in the frequency of MBL2 alleles between the hemato-oncologic and control group. The average duration of fever episodes was significantly shorter (p = 0.035) in patients carrying genotypes (AY/AY and AY/AX) that encode normal MBL level, compared to individuals with genotypes associated with lower functional MBL level (AX/AX, AY/0, AX/0, or 0/0) (days, median (IQ range) 3.7(0-5.4) vs. 5.0(3.8-6.6), respectively). In conclusion, our data suggest that MBL2 genotypes may influence the course of febrile neutropenia in pediatric patients with malignancies, and may contribute to clarification of the importance of MBL in infections.", "Origin and Manipulation of Stable Vortex Ground States in Permalloy Nanotubes.\nWe present a detailed study on the static magnetic properties of individual permalloy nanotubes (NTs) with hexagonal cross-sections. Anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) measurements and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) are used to investigate their magnetic ground states and its stability. We find that the magnetization in zero applied magnetic field is in a very stable vortex state. Its origin is attributed to a strong growth-induced anisotropy with easy axis perpendicular to the long axis of the tubes. AMR measurements of individual NTs in combination with micromagnetic simulations allow the determination of the magnitude of the growth-induced anisotropy for different types of NT coatings. We show that the strength of the anisotropy can be controlled by introducing a buffer layer underneath the magnetic layer. The magnetic ground states depend on the external magnetic field history and are directly imaged using STXM. Stable vortex domains can be introduced by external magnetic fields and can be erased by radio-frequency magnetic fields applied at the center of the tubes via a strip line antenna.", "Molecular characterization of thioredoxin reductase in waterflea Daphnia magna and its expression regulation by polystyrene microplastics.\nGlobal scale concerns regarding rise in microplastics pollution in the environment have recently aroused. Ingestion of microplastics by biota, including freshwater zooplankton has been well studied, however, despite keystone species in freshwater food webs, the molecular response (e.g. oxidative defense) of zooplankton in response to microplastics is still in its infancy. The thioredoxin (TRx) system has a vital function in cellular antioxidative defense via eliminating the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effects of thioredoxin reductase (TRxR), due to its triggering the TRx catalysis cascade. The present study identified TRxR in Daphnia magna (Dm-TRxR) for the first time, and found that the full-length cDNA was 1862 bp long, containing an 1821-bp open reading frame. Homologous alignments showed the presence of conserved catalytic domain CVNVGC and the seleocysteine (SeCys) residue (U) located in the N- and C- terminal portions. Subsequently, the expression of Dm-TRxR, together with permease, arginine kinase (AK), was investigated by approach of quantitative real-time PCR after exposure to four (1.25-\u03bcm) polystyrene (PS) microbeads concentrations: 0 (control), 2, 4 and 8 mg L-1 for 10 days. Dm-TRxR, permease and AK mRNA were significantly upregulated after exposure to 2, 4 mg L-1 of PS, but then declined in the presence of 8 mg L-1 PS. The gene expression results suggested that oxidative defense, energy production and substance extra cellular transportation were significantly regulated by microplastic exposure. Collectively, the present study will advance our knowledge regarding the biological effects of microplastic pollution on zooplankton, and builds a foundation for freshwater environmental studies on mechanistic and biochemical responses to microplastics.", "The ubiquitin proteasome system functions as an inhibitory constraint on synaptic strengthening.\nLong-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity have been shown to depend on changes in gene expression. Although many studies have focused on the regulation of transcription and translation during learning-related synaptic plasticity, regulated protein degradation provides another common means of altering the macromolecular composition of cells. We have investigated the role of the ubiquitin proteasome system in long-lasting forms of learning-related plasticity in Aplysia sensory-motor synapses. We find that inhibition of the proteasome produces a long-lasting (24 hr) increase in synaptic strength between sensory and motor neurons and that it dramatically enhances serotonin-induced long-term facilitation. The increase in synaptic strength produced by proteasome inhibitors is dependent on translation but not transcription. In addition to the increase in synaptic strength, proteasome inhibition leads to an increase in the number of synaptic contacts formed between the sensory and motor neurons. Blockade of the proteasome in isolated postsynaptic motor neurons produces an increase in the glutamate-evoked postsynaptic potential, and blockade of the proteasome in the isolated presynaptic sensory cells produces increases in neurite length and branching. We conclude that both pre- and postsynaptic substrates of the ubiquitin proteasome function constitutively to regulate synaptic strength and growth and that the ubiquitin proteasome pathway functions in mature neurons as an inhibitory constraint on synaptic strengthening.", "Physicochemical properties of alpha- and beta-fibrinogenases of Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus venom.\nalpha- and beta-Fibrinogenases (EC 3.4.21.5) were purified from Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus venom by the technique of recycling chromatography. Both enzymes were single polypeptide chains and homogeneous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. The sedimentation constants of alpha- and beta-fibrinogenases were 2.52 and 3.04 respectively. The molecular weight of alpha-fibrinogenase was 21 500--23 400, and that of beta-fibrinogenase was 25 000--26 000. The contents of proline, glycine and tryptophan were higher in beta-fibrinogenase than in alpha-fibrinogenase. The isoelectric points of alpha- and beta-fibrinogenases were pH 8.1 and 5.7 respectively. The optimal pH of alpha-fibrinogenase was about 7.4 and that of beta-fibrinogenase was around 8.5. The activity of alpha-fibrinogenase was completely destroyed after 30 min at 60 degrees C, pH 5.6, 7.4 and 9.0, while that of beta-fibrinogenase was not significantly affected by the same treatment. Both enzymes showed proteolytic activities toward fibrinogen and casein, but were devoid of phospholipase A, alkaline phosphomonoesterase and phosphodiesterase activities of the crude venom. The tosyl-L-arginine methylester esterase activity of beta-fibrinogenase was about 17 times that of the crude venom, while alpha-fibrinogenase was completely devoid of this activity. The fibrinogenolytic activity of alpha-fibrinogenase was markedly inhibited by EDTA and cysteine, while that of beta-fibrinogenase was inhibited markedly by phenylmethane sulfonylfluoride and slightly by tosyl-L-lysine chloromethylketone and cysteine.", "Emerging anti-inflammatory strategies for COPD.\nThe hallmark of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an enhanced or abnormal inflammatory immune response of the lungs to inhaled particles and gases, usually from cigarette smoke, characterised by increased numbers of neutrophils, activated macrophages and activated T-lymphocytes (Tc1 and Th1 cells). Therefore, suppression of the inflammatory response is a logical approach to the treatment of COPD. Despite the inflammatory nature of COPD, currently available anti-inflammatory therapies provide little or no benefit in COPD patients and may have detrimental effects. For this reason, there is an urgent need to discover effective and safe anti-inflammatory treatments that might prevent the relentless progression of the disease. In recent years, attention has largely been focused on inhibition of recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells, and on antagonism of their products. In this review, we put together a summary of the state-of-the-art development of clearly and/or potentially useful anti-inflammatory strategies in COPD.", "The combination of slow-release nifedipine and atenolol for stable angina.\nBeta-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as atenolol and the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nifedipine, have antianginal actions that should prove complementary when the drugs are used in combination. Atenolol acts primarily by reducing myocardial oxygen demand, while the vasodilator effects of nifedipine can both reduce demand and increase oxygen supply. The slow-release tablet formulation of nifedipine (Nifedipine Retard) provides more persistent plasma concentrations than the conventional capsule formulation, which may prolong the duration of action. There is increasing evidence that the plasma nifedipine concentration is closely related to efficacy, although the absolute concentration required to improve exercise tolerance in patients with angina varies between individuals. Clinical studies indicate that for many patients the duration of action of slow-release nifedipine, particularly when added to atenolol, is less than 12 hours. This reflects the extensive but variable first-pass metabolism of nifedipine, leading to subtherapeutic trough concentrations. To achieve 24-hour symptom relief, slow-release nifedipine will often need to be given three times daily to patients with angina.", "Characterization of a nose-only inhalation exposure system for hydrocarbon mixtures and jet fuels.\nA directed-flow nose-only inhalation exposure system was constructed to support development of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for complex hydrocarbon mixtures, such as jet fuels. Due to the complex nature of the aerosol and vapor-phase hydrocarbon exposures, care was taken to investigate the chamber hydrocarbon stability, vapor and aerosol droplet compositions, and droplet size distribution. Two-generation systems for aerosolizing fuel and hydrocarbons were compared and characterized for use with either jet fuels or a simple mixture of eight hydrocarbons. Total hydrocarbon concentration was monitored via online gas chromatography (GC). Aerosol/vapor (A/V) ratios, and total and individual hydrocarbon concentrations, were determined using adsorbent tubes analyzed by thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TDS-GC-MS). Droplet size distribution was assessed via seven-stage cascade impactor. Droplet mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) was between 1 and 3 mum, depending on the generator and mixture utilized. A/V hydrocarbon concentrations ranged from approximately 200 to 1300 mg/m(3), with between 20% and 80% aerosol content, depending on the mixture. The aerosolized hydrocarbon mixtures remained stable during the 4-h exposure periods, with coefficients of variation (CV) of less than 10% for the total hydrocarbon concentrations. There was greater variability in the measurement of individual hydrocarbons in the A-V phase. In conclusion, modern analytical chemistry instruments allow for improved descriptions of inhalation exposures of rodents to aerosolized fuel.", "Fish, human health and marine ecosystem health: policies in collision.\nHealth recommendations advocating increased fish consumption need to be placed in the context of the potential collapse of global marine capture fisheries. Literature overview. In economically developed countries, official healthy eating advice is to eat more fish, particularly that rich in omega-3 oils. In many less economically developed countries, fish is a key human health asset, contributing >20% of animal protein intake for 2.6 billion people. Marine ecologists predict on current trends that fish stocks are set to collapse in 40 years, and propose increased restrictions on fishing, including no-take zones, in order to restore marine ecosystem health. Production of fishmeal for aquaculture and other non-food uses (22 MT in 2003) appears to be unsustainable. Differences in fish consumption probably contribute to within-country and international health inequalities. Such inequalities are likely to increase if fish stocks continue to decline, while increasing demand for fish will accelerate declines in fish stocks and the health of marine ecosystems. Urgent national and international action is necessary to address the tensions arising from increasing human demand for fish and seafood, and rapidly declining marine ecosystem health.", "Outcome of alloimmunized fetuses managed solely by cordocentesis but not requiring antenatal transfusion.\nA published algorithm for the frequency of fetal blood sampling in the management of fetal hemolytic disease allows many pregnancies to continue 1-3 months after the last sample until delivery at term. Though the positive predictive value for antenatal anemia is known, the likelihood of either neonatal hyperbilirubinemia or an unexpected anemia (< 30%) is not. The perinatal records of 51 antigen-positive neonates who did not require treatment antenatally were abstracted. As fetuses, these neonates had been prospectively coded as either low risk (pattern 1), moderate risk (pattern 2) or high risk (patterns 3 and 4) for antenatal anemia (hematocrit < 30%) based on their hematocrit, reticulocyte count, and the strength of the direct Coombs' test performed on their first sample. Delivery occurred at 38 +/- 2 weeks. Neonatal complications of hemolytic disease were common. Sixty-four percent required phototherapy, 17% one or more double-volume exchange transfusions, and 13% one or more simple transfusions for late-developing anemia. In all, 29% of neonates received postnatal transfusion therapy. The only correlation between the antenatal hematologic/serologic studies and the need for postnatal transfusion therapy was the strength of the indirect Coombs' test performed on the first fetal blood sample. Two neonates unexpectedly had anemia (4% risk). In the first, the hematocrit at 35 weeks was 40% and the ultrasound 1 week later normal. In one, the algorithm had been erroneously applied. Stability of the hematocrit in fetuses at risk to develop antenatal anemia can be accurately predicted by fetal blood tests performed weeks prior to delivery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "PDMS bonding to a bio-friendly photoresist via self-polymerized poly(dopamine) adhesive for complex protein micropatterning inside microfluidic channels.\nProtein micropatterned surfaces integrated with microfluidics are useful in numerous bioanalytical and biological applications. In this study, we demonstrated the fabrication of complex protein micropatterned surfaces within poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic channels by attaching the PDMS channels to bio-friendly photoresist films and subsequently performing microscope projection photolithography (MPP). A muscle-inspired poly(dopamine) (PDA) coating was employed to mediate the bonding between the PDMS and the bio-friendly photoresist poly(2,2-dimethoxy nitrobenzyl methacrylate-r-methyl methacrylate-r-poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) (PDMP). By adjusting the dip-coating time for the PDA coating, we could successfully introduce sufficient amounts of functional groups on the PDMP surfaces to mediate strong bonding between the PDMS channels and the PDA-coated PDMP thin films with minimal alteration of the surface properties of the PDMP thin films that are critical for protein micropatterning. Using this novel bonding strategy, we successfully fabricated multiple protein micropatterns and gradient micropatterns of proteins within microfluidic channels. The technique developed in this study will be useful for the fabrication of complex biochips for multiplex bioassays and fundamental cell biological studies.", "Sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor (SREBF)-2, SREBF cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), and premature coronary artery disease in a Chinese population.\nCellular cholesterol homeostasis is controlled by the sterol-regulatory element binding transcription factors (SREBFs) that are activated by an SREBF cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). SREBF-2 1784G > C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs2228314) and SCAP 2386A > G variant (rs12487736) are associated with early onset myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden cardiac death in middle-aged men. We investigated whether these two SNPs are determinants of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) in a Chinese population. We studied 431 consecutive patients, including 197 with coronary stenosis \u226550% or previous MI and 234 controls without documented CAD (males <55 years and females <65 years). All subjects were genotyped for two SNPs by using the ligase detection reaction method. The three genotypes GG, GC, and CC were present in rs2228314 and two genotypes AA and AG in rs12487736. No gender-specific differences were found in genotype distribution and allele frequencies of these two SNPs between patients with and without CAD. The biochemical and clinical risk factors among participants were not influenced by variants at rs2228314. Logistic regression did not detect the association of these two SNPs with premature CAD, nor did there exist any association of these two SNPs among groups of patients with 0, 1, 2, and 3-vessel disease (all P > 0.05). We could not identify any association between these two SNPs and premature CAD or extent of coronary lesions in a Chinese population.", "Pentraxin 3 and complement cascade activation in the failure of arteriovenous fistula.\nPentraxin-3 (PTX3) has been suggested to play a role in the development of vascular pathology. Stenosis of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) leading to its failure is the major cause of morbidity in hemodialysis patients. To date, little is known on the pathogenesis of AVF stenosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential role of PTX3 in this setting. A sample of venous wall was collected at the time of AVF formation in 44 patients with end stage renal disease. Ten patients developed AVF stenosis and from these patients a second portion of the venous wall was obtained during surgical revision of the AVF. Confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that PTX3 immunostaining, hardly detectable in native AVF, was significantly increased in failed AVF, showing a specific co-localization with endothelial cell markers. Circulating mononuclear cells isolated at the time of AVF revision presented a significantly higher PTX3 mRNA expression than those collected during AVF creation. Interestingly, a significant deposition of C5b-9 on endothelial cells, co-localizing with PTX3, was observed in stenotic AVF. The present study demonstrates for the first time a close association between PTX3 deposition and complement activation at the endothelial cell level in failed AVF and suggests a role for PTX3 in modulating innate immunity in the pathogenesis of AVF stenosis.", "Ostrich specific semen diluent and sperm motility characteristics during in vitro storage.\nThe dilution of semen is a very important initial process for semen processing and evaluation, storage and preservation in vitro and efficient artificial insemination. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of two synthetic diluents (OS1 and OS2) on ostrich sperm motility parameters during in vitro storage. Formulation of OS1 was based on macro minerals (Na, K, P, Ca, Mg) and OS2 on the further addition of micro minerals (Se and Zn), based on mineral concentration determined in the ostrich seminal plasma (SP). Sperm motility was evaluated at different processing stages (neat, after dilution, during storage and after storage) by measuring several sperm motility variables using the Sperm Class Analyzer\u00ae (SCA). Processing (dilution, cooling and storage) of semen for in vitro storage purposes decreased the values for all sperm motility variables measured. The percentage motile (MOT) and progressive motile (PMOT) sperm decreased 20% to 30% during 24 h of storage, independent of diluent type. Quality of sperm swim (LIN, STR and WOB), however, was sustained during the longer storage periods (48 h) with the OS2 diluent modified with Se and Zn additions. Quality of sperm swim with use of OS1 was 6% to 8% less for the LIN, STR, and WOB variables. Male fitted as a fixed effect accounted for >60% of the variation for certain sperm motility variables (PMOT, MOT, VCL, VSL, VAP and ALH) evaluated at different processing stages. Semen from specific males had sustained sperm motility characteristics to a greater extent than that of other males during the 24-h storage period.", "BnEPFL6, an EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE (EPFL) secreted peptide gene, is required for filament elongation in Brassica napus.\nInflorescence architecture, pedicel length and stomata patterning in Arabidopsis thaliana are specified by inter-tissue communication mediated by ERECTA and its signaling ligands in the EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE (EPFL) family of secreted cysteine-rich peptides. Here, we identified and characterized BnEPFL6 from Brassica napus. Heterologous expression of this gene under the double enhanced CaMV promoter (D35S) in Arabidopsis resulted in shortened stamen filaments, filaments degradation, and reduced filament cell size that displayed down-regulated expression of AHK2, in which phenotypic variation of ahk2-1 mutant presented highly consistent with that of BnEPFL6 transgenic lines. Especially, the expression level of BnEPFL6 in the shortened filaments of four B. napus male sterile lines (98A, 86A, SA, and Z11A) was similar to that of BnEPFL6 in the transgenic Arabidopsis lines. The activity of pBnEPFL6.2::GUS was intensive in the filaments of transgenic lines. These observations reveal that BnEPFL6 plays an important role in filament elongation and may also affect organ morphology and floral organ specification via a BnEPFL6-mediated cascade.", "[Preliminary study on the genotyping of Mycobacterium leprae on 50 isolates from China].\nTo understand the genotypic mapping of Mycobacterium leprae identified in China and to compare with those from other countries to select suitable alleles for epidemiological investigation in the transmission chain of leprosy. Various number of tandem repeat(VNTR) in genomic DNA of Mycobacterium leprae was used in the present genotyping study. 33 skin biopsies from Wenshan prefecture,Yunnan province and 17 from other parts of China were studied. DNA extracted from skin biopsies of leprosy patients was subjected to PCR followed by agarose gel analysis and DNA sequencing to determine the number of repeats. Loci GGT-5,12-5,21-3 and 23-3 were as highly homogenous as 100%; The homogeneity of loci AC-8, 18-8, 27-5 and rpoT were 97%, 94%, 97% and 85% respectively. Loci GTA-9, AC-9 and 6-7 showed significant allelic diversity in isolates and the diversity of GTA-9 in Mycobacterium leprae isolated from China was also different from those identified other countries. We had subjected loci GTA-9 and the ten loci to phylogenetic tree analysis respectively. The present study revealed that the genotype of Mycobacterium leprae identified from China was close to the strains from the Philippines and India although a few loci were somehow differentiate. Locus 12-5 manifested as only 3 copies in China whereas 4-5 copies predominating in other countries. 12-5 locus might serve as a useful marker to diffrentiate Chinese strains from those in other countries. However, further study on the diversity of GTA-9 was needed in China. The molecular typing of Mycobacterium leprae from different geographic areas might be useful in studying the transmission of leprosy.", "Severe obstructive sleep apnea is associated with significant coronary artery plaque burden independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.\nObstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is strongly associated with adverse cardiovascular events. In these patients, increased oxidative stress has been associated with accelerated coronary atherosclerosis. However, it is unclear if OSA is associated with significant coronary artery plaque burden. Our aim is to determine whether OSA and/or markers of hypoxemia are associated with coronary plaque burden (CPB). Patients who had coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and a polysomnogram within 1 year of each other between 2011 and 2016 were analyzed. Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) and hypoxemic burden (ODI3%, ODI4%, nadir SpO2, average spO2 and time of spO2 < 88%) were obtained from the polysomnogram. Total CPB was assessed using the prognostically validated CT-Leaman score (CT-LeSc). Significant CPB was defined as CT-LeSc \u2265 8.3. There were 119 patients with mean (\u00b1 SD) age of 59 \u00b1 12 years. Using logistical regression analysis; AHI, ODI4% and ODI3% were the only parameters associated with significant CPB. Severe OSA (AHI \u2265 30 events/h) was associated with significant CPB with adjusted OR of 3.21 (p = 0.010) independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Mechanisms associated with apnea and hypopnea events (as measured by AHI, ODI3% and ODI4%), but not the severity of arterial desaturation (nadir SpO2, burden of SpO2 < 88%) were associated with significant CPB.", "Research on sexual behavior often characterizes rough sex as sexual aggression and as violent or abusive in nature. In a sample of 734 male and female undergraduates, we examined the extent of rough sexual acts in romantic relationships, the triggers for those acts, and how rough sex differs from \u201ctypical\u201d sex. Participants were asked their definition of rough sex, questions regarding sexual aggression and behaviors during rough sex, and abusive behaviors in the relationship. Findings indicate that rough sex is triggered by curiosity and a need for novelty, and that both men and women often initiate rough sexual behaviors. Consensual rough sex typically results in little violence and only superficial injuries such as scratches, bruises, and welts. Rough sex does not correlate with violence in the relationship or abuse. However, rough sexual behaviors were increased in situations that involved male sexual jealousy. Being separated from a sexual partner was the second most common trigger for rough sex, particularly for men. Aspects of rough sex, such as increased semen displacement and decreased latency for female orgasm are discussed.", "CXCL12 is involved in \u03b1-synuclein-triggered neuroinflammation of Parkinson's disease.\nThe mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) remain elusive, but recent opinions and perspectives have focused on whether the inflammation process induced by microglia contributes to \u03b1-synuclein-mediated toxicity. Migration of microglia to the substantia nigra (SN) could precede neurodegeneration in A53T mice. We hypothesized that CXCL12 could be a mediator in the \u03b1-synuclein-induced migration of microglia. After establishing appropriate animal and cell culture models, we explored the relationship between \u03b1-synuclein and CXCL12 in A53T mice, primary microglia, and BV-2 cell lines. We also explored the mechanisms of these interactions and the signaling processes involved in neuroinflammation. We confirmed the positive correlation between \u03b1-synuclein and CXCL12 in the postmortem brain tissue of PD patients and the upregulated CXCR4 expression in SN microglia of A53T mice. In addition, as expected, \u03b1-synuclein increased the production of CXCL12 in microglia via TLR4/I\u03baB-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB signaling. Importantly, CXCL12/CXCR4/FAK/Src/Rac1 signaling was shown to be involved in \u03b1-synuclein-induced microglial accumulation. Our study suggests that CXCL12 could be a novel target for the prevention of \u03b1-synuclein-triggered ongoing microglial responses. Blocking CXCL12/CXCR4 may be a potential therapeutic approach for PD progression.", "Sexual behaviours and contraceptive use among female secondary school adolescents in a rural town in RiverS state, South-south Nigeria.\nAccording to World Health Organization (WHO), adolescents are persons aged 10-19 years. They comprise nearly half of the world's population of about 7 billion and 85% of them live in developing countries. The aim of this study is to assess the sexual behaviours, practices and contraceptive use among secondary school adolescents in Elele, Rivers State, Nigeria. A cross-sectional descriptive study of 300 in-school adolescents in a rural community in Rivers State, South-South Nigeria, selected using multi-stage random sampling technique. There was a high awareness of contraception among respondents, 235 (78.3%), with condom, 207 (88.1%), having the highest awareness. About forty-five percent of respondents, (134), in this survey have had their first sexual debut and 84.3% of this number was sexually active in the last six months preceding this survey. The mean, median and the modal age of first sexual debut were; 12.0 + 2.8, 12.6, and 12.4 years respectively with the youngest age of initiation of sexual activity being 5 years. About two-thirds of those sexually active have multiple sexual partners. Contraceptive use was statistically higher among the sexually active respondents, (74.3%), than the sample study population, (30.3%), (\u03a72 = 65.08, p = 0.000). Condom use at their last sexual debut, (58.2%), was significantly higher than use in their first sexual debut (31.3%), (\u03a72 = 16.17, p = 0.000). The most commonly used contraceptive method was condom, (81.7%). CoNCLUSION: High risk sexual behaviour and increased sexual activity was prevalent in this age group. Efforts to promote sexuality education and contraceptive awareness should be intensified.", "The vortex--an early predictor of cardiovascular outcome?\nBlood motion in the heart features vortices that accompany the redirection of jet flows towards the outlet tracks. Vortices have a crucial role in fluid dynamics. The stability of cardiac vorticity is vital to the dynamic balance between rotating blood and myocardial tissue and to the development of cardiac dysfunction. Moreover, vortex dynamics immediately reflect physiological changes to the surrounding system, and can provide early indications of long-term outcome. However, the pathophysiological relevance of cardiac fluid dynamics is still unknown. We postulate that maladaptive intracardiac vortex dynamics might modulate the progressive remodelling of the left ventricle towards heart failure. The evaluation of blood flow presents a new paradigm in cardiac function analysis, with the potential for sensitive risk identification of cardiac abnormalities. Description of cardiac flow patterns after surgery or device therapy provides an intrinsic qualitative evaluation of therapeutic procedures, and could enable early risk stratification of patients vulnerable to adverse cardiac remodelling.", "Activation of GABAA receptors in hypothalamus modulates PGF2 alpha- or PGE2-induced catecholamine secretion in rats.\nWe previously reported that injection of PGF2 alpha into the third cerebral ventricle produces hyperglycemia and hyperthermia associated with catecholamine secretion in anesthetized rats. We have also studied the potency of catecholamine secretion induced by injecting PGE2 or PGF2 alpha into the third cerebral ventricle and the effect of the GABA-selective agonist, muscimol, on the catecholamine secretion induced by PGE2 or PGF2 alpha. Administration of 50 micrograms of PGE2 into the third cerebral ventricle increased norepinephrine secretion to a greater extent than the same dose of PGF2 alpha, whereas the latter increased epinephrine secretion to a greater degree. These effects paralleled the potencies of the hyperglycemic and hyperthermic effects of PGF2 alpha and PGE2, respectively. Simultaneous injection of 2.5 nmol of muscimol into the third cerebral ventricle with 50 micrograms of PGF2 alpha or PGE2 completely suppressed epinephrine and norepinephrine secretion induced by PGF2 alpha or PGE2. These findings suggest that central PGF2 alpha and PGE2 stimulate epinephrine and norepinephrine secretion with different potencies, and that brain GABAA receptors suppress catecholamine secretion induced by PGF2 alpha or PGE2.", "Stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) targeting reperfusion reduces myocardial infarction in isolated rat hearts.\nRecent studies have shown that stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1), first known as a cytokine involved in recruiting stem cells into injured organs, confers myocardial protection in myocardial infarction, which is not dependent on stem cell recruitment but related with modulation of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the effect of SDF has been studied only in a preischemic exposure model, which is not clinically relevant if SDF is to be used as a therapeutic agent. Our study was aimed at evaluating whether or not SDF-1 confers cardioprotection during the reperfusion period. Hearts from SD rats were isolated and perfused with the Langendorff system. Proximal left coronary artery ligation, reperfusion, and SDF perfusion in KH buffer was done according to study protocol. Area of necrosis (AN) relative to area at risk (AR) was the primary endpoint of the study. Significant reduction of AN/AR by SDF in an almost dose-dependent manner was noted during both the preischemic exposure and reperfusion periods. In particular, infusion of a high concentration of SDF (25 nM/L) resulted in a dramatic reduction of infarct size, which was greater than that achieved with ischemic pre- or postconditioning. SDF perfusion during reperfusion was associated with a similar significant reduction of infarct size as preischemic SDF exposure. Further studies are warranted to assess the potential of SDF as a therapeutic agent for reducing I/R injury in clinical practice.", "Lysozyme and defense peptides as suppressors of phenoloxidase activity in Galleria mellonella.\nThe prophenoloxidase (proPO) cascade supplies quinones and other reactive compounds for melanin formation, protein cross-linking, hemolymph coagulation, and killing of microbial invaders as well as parasites. The high cytotoxicity of the generated compounds requires a strict control of the activation of the proPO system and phenoloxidase (PO) activity to minimize damage to host tissues and cells. The PO activity in hemolymph of Escherichia coli challenged Galleria mellonella larvae increased, with a temporal drop 1 h after the challenge, reaching the highest level 24 h after the challenge. In the present study, a potential role of G. mellonella defense peptides and lysozyme in controlling the proPO system was investigated. The effects of purified defense peptides (anionic peptides 1 and 2, cecropin D-like peptide, Galleria defensin, proline-rich peptides 1 and 2) and lysozyme were analyzed. Four compounds, namely lysozyme, Galleria defensin, proline-rich peptide 1, and anionic peptide 2, decreased the hemolymph PO activity considerably, whereas the others did not affect the enzyme activity level. Our results indicate that these hemolymph factors could play multiple and distinct roles in the insect immune response.", "[Effect of metformin on the clinical course of gout and insulin resistance].\nThe aim of this prospective study was to evaluate results of metformin (MF) therapy during 1 year of uric acid (UA) metabolism and the clinical course of gout with insulin resistance (IR). The study included 30 patients (28 men and 2 women) of mean age 51 yr and duration of he disease 4-11 yr. IR was diagnosed based on the HOMA index. the absence of anti-gout therapy, normal renal and hepatic function, abstinence. The patients were given 1500 mg MF/day. The measured parameters included anthropometric and clinical characteristics, 24 hour AP, plasma UA, glucose, insulin, urea, creatinine, ALT, AST, lipid spectrum at the first and subsequent visits. UA clearance and excreted UA fraction were calculated. UA level decreased from 569 +/- 109.5 to 442.8 +/-107.4 mcmol/l (p < 0.01) after 12 months of MF therapy. Normouricemia ( < 360 mcmol/l) was achieved in 11 patients. Fasting insulin level dropped by 35% (from 23.9 to 15.9 mcU/ml, p < 0.01), HOMA index from 6.5 to 3. 7(p < 0.01). Serum glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol decreased while HDL cholesterol increased. Parameters of renal UA regulation and anthropometry remained unaltered. MF therapy resulted in a decrease of serum UA, insulin, and the degree of IR. The hypouricemic effect of MF was unrelated to renal UA excretion, reduced AP and body weight. It is hypothesized that MF reduces production of UA in patients with gout due to inhibition of synthesis of free fatty acids.", "Comparison of routine and selective use of intraoperative angiography during aneurysm surgery: a prospective assessment.\nWhether routine intraoperative angiography is necessary for cerebral aneurysm surgery is currently under debate. In this study the authors prospectively assessed the cerebrovascular surgeon's accuracy in predicting the need for intraoperative angiography. Between January 2002 and January 2003, 200 consecutive patients (141 female and 59 male patients, mean age 52.8 years) with 235 aneurysms underwent routine intraoperative angiography. Before the operation, the surgeons indicated whether they believed that intraoperative angiography was necessary. Their responses were recorded as \"intraoperative angiography necessary\" or \"intraoperative angiography unnecessary.\" Regardless of the response, all patients underwent intraoperative angiography after the aneurysm had been clipped. Changes in treatment resulting from intraoperative angiography were compared with surgeons' preoperative predictions of the need for intraoperative angiography. Intraoperative angiography was predicted to be necessary in 41 cases (20%) and unnecessary in 159 cases (80%). Its use altered treatment in 14 patients. Seven of these patients were among the group in which intraoperative angiography was deemed necessary and seven were in the group in which it was considered unnecessary. In the latter group, two patients had residual aneurysms, three had parent vessel occlusion, and two had previously undiagnosed aneurysms. Only one patient (0.5%) sustained a major intraoperative complication attributed to angiography. Given the frequency of significant disease that remains undetected if intraoperative angiography is used on a selective basis and the low complication rate associated with the procedure, the use of intraoperative angiography should be considered in the majority of aneurysm cases.", "The goal of this application is to understand the interactions of von Willebrand factor (Vwf) with platelet membrane glycoprotein Ib/IX and with subendothelial collagen. In this First Aim, three dimensional structures of recombinant Vwf A1 domain with and with a GpIb peptide will be determined by x- ray diffraction. This will be done with collaboration with Dr. Liddington. In the Second Aim, conformational changes in the Vwf A1 domain that allow Vwf to interact with platelet GPIb will be identified by developing conformationally dependent antibodies. In the Third Aim, the x-ray structure of the Vwf A3 domain will be determined and used as a guide for mutagenesis studies that characterize the interaction of Vwf A3 with collagen. In the Fourth Aim, potential interactions between the A1 and A3 domains will be defined by direct binding studies of the individual domains as well as by obtaining an X-ray structure of the A1A2A3 Vwf polypeptide. In the Fifth Aim, a novel form of von Willebrand's disease characterized by defective collagen binding will be defined.", "Ecological basis for regulating aquatic emissions from the power industry: the case with selenium.\nSelenium can have severe ecological impacts on aquatic ecosystems even when waterborne concentrations are in the low microgram per liter (ppb) range. Episodes of environmental contamination have occurred that clearly illustrate the potential toxicity of this trace element to aquatic organisms. Wastes and effluents produced by the power industry are highly concentrated sources of selenium and constitute hazardous wastes when introduced into aquatic ecosystems. The continued use of a wet-basin system of coal-ash disposal at power plants is only feasible if several environmental variables are considered along with models of trace element cycling and accumulation, and pretreatment of effluents. Other power industry operations, such as coal gasification and liquifaction, must include provisions for treating effluents as an integral part of construction design. The ecological data base indicates that new, rigorous water quality criteria for selenium are needed; criteria presently proposed by EPA and others would not protect freshwater life if adopted as standards by regulatory agencies. This data base has been utilized by the State of North Carolina to develop sound, defensible environmental standards for selenium in surface waters. Ecological information can be used nationwide to establish reasonable and prudent regulations governing selenium-laden effluents from the power industry.", "Education, the brain and dementia: neuroprotection or compensation?\nThe potential protective role of education for dementia is an area of major interest. Almost all older people have some pathology in their brain at death but have not necessarily died with dementia. We have explored these two observations in large population-based cohort studies (Epidemiological Clinicopathological Studies in Europe; EClipSE) in an investigation of the relationships of brain pathology at death, clinical dementia and time in education, testing the hypothesis that greater exposure to education reduces the risk of dementia. EClipSE has harmonized longitudinal clinical data and neuropathology from three longstanding population-based studies that included post-mortem brain donation. These three studies started between 1985 and 1991. Number of years of education during earlier life was recorded at baseline. Incident dementia was detected through follow-up interviews, complemented by retrospective informant interviews, death certificate data and linked health/social records (dependent on study) after death. Dementia-related neuropathologies were assessed in each study in a comparable manner based on the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease protocol. Eight hundred and seventy-two brain donors were included, of whom 56% were demented at death. Longer years in education were associated with decreased dementia risk and greater brain weight but had no relationship to neurodegenerative or vascular pathologies. The associations between neuropathological variables and clinical dementia differed according to the 'dose' of education such that more education reduced dementia risk largely independently of severity of pathology. More education did not protect individuals from developing neurodegenerative and vascular neuropathology by the time they died but it did appear to mitigate the impact of pathology on the clinical expression of dementia before death. The findings suggest that an understanding of the mechanisms leading to functional protection in the presence of pathology may be of considerable value to society.", "[Physiology and pathophysiology of cardiac impulse conduction].\nRepresentation of cardiac tissue by a continuous electrical cable provides a simple tool to explain impulse propagation and to make a comparison between heart, skeletal muscle and nerve. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have shown, however, that the process of electrical impulse propagation in heart is complex, due to the presence of cell borders and septa of connective tissue. At sites where propagation deviates from a linear profile, action potential generation gets delayed, and in cases of decreased excitability, unidirectional block may occur. At such sites, propagation is carried by the slow Ca++ inward current, in addition to the rapid Na+ inward current. As a consequence, local propagation may become sensitive to inhibition of Ca++ channels. Moreover, computer simulations have shown that electrical cell-to-cell uncoupling an gap junctions can reverse unidirectional block at such sites to bidirectional conduction. This complex interaction between function and structure which is likely to play a major role in remodeled tissue (hypertrophy, chronic infarction) has to be taken into account in the evaluation of the mechanisms of action of antiarrhythmic drugs.", "This study proposes to link findings about human visual processing provided by non-invasive electrophysiological and hemodynamic methodologies with the more detailed analyses of physiological mechanisms that can only be carried out intracranially in primates. This convergent methodology approach will be applied to the study of the temporal pattern of information flow through the visual neural areas during a selective-attention task. Specifically, we will study the distribution of effects across the different functionally selective areas (e.g. V4, IT, MT) as the organism engages in a feature attention task, whereby the features of color, shape and spatial- location are alternately attended to in a compound visual stimulus. We will address how recurrent activation of \"higher- order\" visual areas and primary areas subserve the attention process for each of these attributes. Further, task difficulty will be manipulated such that attentional-load is predicted to cause a redistribution of the attention mechanism across the particular feature-sensitive subset of neural areas. This is predicted to include V1 involvement, as the brain struggles to maintain performance and is required to involve primary sensory areas, although not necessarily \"earlier\" in time, but perhaps in a top-down mediated manner. It is critical to our understanding of brain function to detail the timing of such inter- areal activation patterns, as the neural network effects sensory and perceptual operations.", "Characterization of a new cellulosic natural fiber extracted from the root of Ficus religiosa tree.\nPhysical, chemical, thermal and crystalline properties of new natural fiber extracted from the root of Ficus Religiosa tree(FRRF) are reported in this study. The chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis results ensured the presence of higher quantity of cellulose content (55.58 wt%) in the FRRF. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analysis is transported away to support the chemical groups present in the considered fibre. Thermal stability (325 \u00b0C), maximum degradation temperature (400 \u00b0C) and kinetic activation energy (68.02 kJ/mol.) of the FRRF areestablished by the thermo gravimetric analysis. The diameter (25.62 \u03bcm) and density (1246 kg/m3) of the FRRF have been found by the physical analysis. Scanning electron microscope analysis (SEM) and Atomic force microscope analysis (AFM) outcomes revealed that FRRF has the relatively smoothest surface. Altogether the above outcomes proved that novel FRRF is the desirable reinforcement to fabricate the fiber reinforced composite materials.", "[The saga of aspirin: centuries-old ancestors of an old lady who doesn't deserve to die].\nWhere do analgics come from? If their ancestors are many centuries old, we observe that the four main drugs of modern analgesia, morphine (1816), codeine (1832), paracetamol (1893) and aspirin (1897) were discovered during the 19th century. And through what 'sagas'! The first known prescriptions, written on earthenware shelves in Mesopotamia 3 centuries BC, already mentioned medications derived from willow to cure headaches. The Greeks dedicated to Asclepios, god of therapeutics, a statue carved in a willow trunk as a symbol! Thus, before becoming a drug, aspirin was born from the willow, which grows with its feet in water 'without suffering', as the ancestors put it. But before it walked on the moon with Neil Armstrong in 1969, the discovery of aspirin as a drug was the consequence of the filial love of a young researcher, Felix Hoffmann, who wanted to decrease the resistant pain of his rheumatic old father.", "Pain-related magnetic fields evoked by intra-epidermal electrical stimulation in humans.\nWe recently developed a new method for the preferential stimulation of Adelta fibers in humans. The aim of the present study was to examine whether this method can serve as an appropriate stimulus in a magnetoencephalographic study. We recorded somatosensory-evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) following intra-epidermal electrical stimulation applied to the hand and elbow. Superficial parts of the skin were electrically stimulated through a needle electrode whose tip was inserted in the epidermis. In all 13 subjects, the equivalent current dipole was estimated in the secondary somatosensory cortices (SII). In 5 out of 13 subjects, simultaneous activation of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) in the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulation was identified. The mean peak latencies of magnetic fields corresponding to contralateral SI, SII and ipsilateral SII activation following hand stimulation were 162, 158 and 171 ms, respectively. The respective latency following elbow stimulation was 137, 139 and 157 ms, respectively. Estimated peripheral conduction velocity was 15.6m/s. All the results were consistent with previous findings in pain SEF studies. We concluded that our novel intra-epidermal electrical stimulation is useful for pain SEF studies since it does not need special equipment and is easy to control.", "Ultrafiltration and reinfusion of residual cardiopulmonary bypass pump blood: A prospective non-randomized controlled study.\nThe aim of the study was to investigate whether processing residual pump blood with ultrafiltration could increase the increment of hemoglobin after residual pump blood reinfusion and evaluate its influence on plasma-free hemoglobin (pFHb) level and postoperative renal function. Sixty adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were assigned to 2 groups, based on pump blood processing strategy: ultrafiltration plus reinfusion (n = 30) or reinfusion (control; n = 30). Increment in hemoglobin and pFHb after reinfusion (\u0394Hgb, \u0394pFHb), reinfusion volume, postoperative chest drainage volume (first 24 h), duration of mechanical ventilation, changes in serum creatinine, and prevalence of AKI were compared between the 2 groups. Higher levels of both \u0394Hgb and \u0394pFHb were observed after reinfusion in the ultrafiltration group [\u0394Hgb 1.8 \u00b1 1.1 g/dL vs. 1.2 \u00b1 0.6 g/dL, P = 0.03, \u0394pFHb 100 (0, 200) mg/L vs. 0 (-100, 0) mg/L, P = 0.03]. The reinfusion volume was lower in the ultrafiltration group [550 (325, 615) mL vs. 1000 (900, 1180) mL, P < 0.001]. No differences were found in postoperative chest drainage volume (first 24 h), duration of mechanical ventilation, changes in serum creatinine, and prevalence of AKI. Compared to the unprocessed group, ultrafiltration before reinfusion of residual pump blood improved the hemoglobin level and reduced volume loading. Despite an increase in pFHb, the processing procedure was not related to postoperative kidney injury.", "Quercetin inhibits diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatic preneoplastic lesions in rats.\nQuercetin is an antioxidant flavonoid, found ubiquitously in nature and extensively used in herbal medicines and food additives. This study aimed to investigate the effect of quercetin on diethylnitrosamine-induced preneoplastic lesions, using the medium-term rat liver bioassay. The \u03b3-benzene hexachloride was used as promoter at the doses of 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mg/kg against a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (200 mg/kg) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. All the rats were subjected to 70% partial hepatectomy at Week 4. The protective effect of quercetin (5 and 25 mg/kg) was examined against the highest dose of \u03b3-benzene hexachloride (10 mg/kg). A significant increase in the number as well as the mean area of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci, p53 positive hepatocytes, and the percentage of apoptotic cells were observed in the diethylnitrosamine-treated group. In the present investigation, both doses of QC (5 and 25 mg/kg) led to a significant decrease in the number as well as the mean area of GST-P positive foci, TUNEL positive apoptotic cells, p53 positive hepatocytes, and restoration of cellular morphology. These results clearly indicate that quercetin inhibits diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatic preneoplastic lesions in medium-term rat liver bioassay.", "Derivation of a hydrodynamic theory for mesoscale dynamics in microswimmer suspensions.\nIn this paper, we systematically derive a fourth-order continuum theory capable of reproducing mesoscale turbulence in a three-dimensional suspension of microswimmers. We start from overdamped Langevin equations for a generic microscopic model (pushers or pullers), which include hydrodynamic interactions on both small length scales (polar alignment of neighboring swimmers) and large length scales, where the solvent flow interacts with the order parameter field. The flow field is determined via the Stokes equation supplemented by an ansatz for the stress tensor. In addition to hydrodynamic interactions, we allow for nematic pair interactions stemming from excluded-volume effects. The results here substantially extend and generalize earlier findings [S. Heidenreich et al., Phys. Rev. E 94, 020601 (2016)2470-004510.1103/PhysRevE.94.020601], in which we derived a two-dimensional hydrodynamic theory. From the corresponding mean-field Fokker-Planck equation combined with a self-consistent closure scheme, we derive nonlinear field equations for the polar and the nematic order parameter, involving gradient terms of up to fourth order. We find that the effective microswimmer dynamics depends on the coupling between solvent flow and orientational order. For very weak coupling corresponding to a high viscosity of the suspension, the dynamics of mesoscale turbulence can be described by a simplified model containing only an effective microswimmer velocity.", "[Tick-borne encephalitis in a child in a nonendemic country: A case report].\nTick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is an arbovirus induced by tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) transmitted by tick bite. The disease is rare in France (two to three cases per year) but endemic zones extend from Western Europe to the east coast of Asia (10,000-15,000 cases per year). An 8-year-old boy was admitted to our pediatric ward in Strasbourg (France) for febrile headache with diplopia. Four days after a tick bite, he declared a febrile headache together with maculopapular rash on the elbows, knees, and cheeks. Fourteen days after the outbreak of symptoms, he showed confusion, drowsiness, and binocular diplopia. Brain MRI was normal and the electroencephalogram found diffuse slow activity with no discharge. Lumbar puncture found meningitis with 92 cells (60% neutrophils, 40% lymphocytes). The diagnosis was made with specific IgM and IgG antibody isolation in the serum (Elisa). Lyme serology was negative. The evolution was slowly favorable and the child remained hospitalized for 8 days. The neurological control examination 2 weeks later was normal except for a moderate left deviation during tandem walk and left Romberg manoeuver. Meningitis or meningoencephalitis in a child must raise the diagnosis of TBE in children, even in nonendemic countries, given the recent increased incidence of TBE and the development of tourism. Recent travel in endemic areas, a history of tick bite, and a clinical course in two phases must be sought. The diagnosis is serologic and prevention is based on vaccination.", "Process scale separation of an anti-CD22 immunotoxin charge variant.\nWe describe the analytical characterization and process scale separation of a deamidated variant of an immunotoxin. The different charge variants of the immunotoxin were separated using analytical ion-exchange HPLC. These charge variants were analyzed by peptide mapping and LC-MS/MS to identify the site of modification, which was determined to reside in the toxin portion of the molecule. Using a cell-based bioassay it was also determined that deamidation led to reduced biological activity, requiring it be controlled during manufacturing. This was accomplished using process scale anion-exchange chromatography. The process was capable of reducing the deamidated form to a level low enough for the resulting product to maintain acceptable biological activity. Keys to the successful control of this impurity at process scale were a good understanding of structure-function relationship and the availability of an analytical HPLC assay to provide a surrogate for the cell-based bioassay.", "Attributable risks for bladder cancer in northern Italy.\nAttributable risks (ARs) for bladder cancer were computed in relationship to cigarette smoking, coffee consumption, low intake of vegetables, history of cystitis, and occupation using data from a case-control study conducted in northern Italy between 1985 and 1993. Cases were 431 patients with histologically confirmed bladder cancer, and controls were 491 patients admitted to the same network of hospitals for acute, nonneoplastic, and non-urinary-tract diseases. Overall, the AR estimates were 49% for cigarette smoking, 23% for coffee consumption, 16% for low intake of vegetables, 12% for history of cystitis, and 4% for occupation. These five factors together explained more than 70% of bladder cancer cases in this population. The AR for cigarette smoking was significantly higher among men (56%) than women (17%), whereas coffee consumption, low vegetable intake, and cystitis were more important (but not significantly so) among women. These results suggest that more than 2500 of the 5400 deaths due to bladder cancer in Italy in 1990 could have been prevented by the elimination of cigarette smoking. With some appropriate dietary modification and intervention to prevent urinary tract infections and occupational exposures, this figure could approach 4000 avoidable deaths. Thus, bladder cancer could become a rare cause of death in this population.", "Purification of SEF1 proteins binding to transcriptional enhancer elements active in T lymphocytes.\nBinding sites for SL3-3 enhancer factor 1 (SEF1) are important for the transcriptional activity in T lymphocytes and the tumorigenicity of SL3-3 murine leukemia virus. SEF1 is also implicated in the activity of many other leukemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma virus enhancers, and enhancers of genes for T cell receptor-CD3 subunits. We have purified several proteins binding to SEF1 sites from bovine thymus using a five-step purification procedure. The proteins migrated as 19 distinct bands representing molecular masses from 23 kDa to about 200 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Ten DNA binding proteins, with molecular masses between 23 and 67 kDa, could be isolated after separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The DNA binding specificities of these proteins were similar and corresponded to that of the SEF1 binding activity in nuclear extracts. Each of these isolated SEF1 proteins also bound to the essential delta-E3 element of the human T cell receptor delta enhancer. Antibodies against one SEF1 protein only reacted with the protein used for immunization, which indicates a limited homology between at least some SEF1 proteins. We also present data suggesting that SEF1 proteins exist in multiple forms with differences in their DNA binding specificity, and that high affinity DNA binding of the SEF1 proteins requires protein phosphorylation.", "Migraine aggravation caused by cephalic venous congestion.\nCerebral venous distension is thought by some to serve as a source of migraine pain. Previous investigators have tried to modify pain intensity by induction of additional venous congestion via compression of both internal jugular veins (Queckenstedt's maneuver). The magnitude of blood flow within the internal jugular veins depends markedly on body position, and inconsistencies in positioning may have influenced their results. To investigate the effect of Queckenstedt's maneuver, performed both in the upright and in the supine body position, in migraineurs during an acute attack. Twenty-five patients (18 women, 7 men; mean age +/- SD, 35.4 +/- 13.3 years) with International Headache Society-defined migraine without aura were evaluated. Queckenstedt's maneuver was performed in both body positions during an acute migraine attack, involving constant application of manual pressure to both internal jugular veins for 30 seconds. Headache intensity was rated before, during, and after Queckenstedt's maneuver on a scale extending from 1 (mild) to 10 (intolerable). Seventeen patients (68%) reported an increase of headache intensity in the supine position during Queckenstedt's maneuver. In the sitting position, pain increase was observed only in 6 patients (24%). The magnitude of pain increase was significantly greater in the supine position compared to the upright position (P=.02). Our results support a role for cerebral venous congestion in the generation of migraine pain and suggest body position may influence the clinical expression of that process.", "12-month follow-up after successful infliximab therapy in pediatric crohn disease.\nInfliximab (IFX) therapy is highly efficacious for the induction and maintenance of remission in pediatric Crohn disease (CD). However, to date it is unclear how long patients should be given IFX. Given the increasing safety concerns about the concomitant and prolonged use of IFX and azathioprine in CD, we wanted to address the clinical outcome in pediatric CD patients who responded to IFX medication, once IFX was stopped. Upon induction therapy with 3 IFX infusions, 36 of 38 patients with CD were in clinical remission at 3 months. These 36 responders were separated into 2 groups: 16 patients received no further IFX infusions, whereas 20 patients received scheduled maintenance therapy with IFX for 12 months. Among the 16 patients who received no further IFX infusions, 12 experienced relapse during the 12-month follow-up interval after IFX was stopped. In the group receiving maintenance therapy, 11 of 20 patients remained in clinical remission at 12 months of therapy, whereas 8 patients required adjustment of IFX doses or intervals. Among the 11 children who were in clinical remission and receiving maintenance therapy without dose adjustment, 8 experienced relapse within 12 months after IFX maintenance therapy was stopped. Overall, the relapse rates after IFX induction or maintenance therapy was stopped were 75% and 72%, respectively. These data indicate that IFX is efficacious in controlling severe pediatric CD; however, to induce and maintain clinical remission, repeated IFX infusions are required, with a need for dose adjustment in a substantial number of patients.", "Rolipram as a discriminative stimuli: transfer to phosphodiesterase inhibitors.\nRats were trained to discriminate (+/-)-rolipram (0.32 mg/kg, i.p.) from saline in a two-lever food-reinforced drug discrimination procedure (FR 10). (+/-)-Rolipram served as a drug discriminative stimulus, and its discrimination was readily established with a mean of 42 training sessions to achieve criterion performance (at least 80% correct response in the consecutive generalization tests with both saline and (+/-)-rolipram). Thereafter, this stimulus was stably maintained. The (-)-isomer of rolipram was generalized at about one-third of the training dose of the (+/-)-compound, but the (+)-isomer was generalized only at 10 times the dose of the (+/-)-compound. This finding suggests that the (-)-compound is more extensively involved as a stimulus than either (+/-)-rolipram or the (+)-isomer. Ro20-1724, caffeine and theophylline, which are phosphodiesterase inhibitors, were generalized to (+/-)-rolipram. This result strongly suggests that phosphodiesterase inhibition may be an important factor involved in (+/-)-rolipram discrimination.", "Polymorphism of the aldosterone synthase gene is not associated with progression of diabetic nephropathy, but associated with hypertension in type 2 diabetic patients.\nInhibition of aldosterone system is beneficial in diabetic nephropathy, and aldosterone synthesis is regulated at the gene-encoding aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2). Considering the role of aldosterone in diabetic nephropathy, genetic polymorphism of this gene may contribute to the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. In this study, we investigated whether it is associated with diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients. 197 type 2 diabetic patients and 71 healthy controls were enrolled. The study subjects were divided into four groups: healthy controls with normoalbuminuria (n = 71), normoalbuminuric diabetic group (n = 71), microalbuminuric diabetic group (n = 51) and overt proteinuria group (n = 51). Polymorphism of aldosterone synthase gene was determined using standard PCR technique. Higher frequency of TT genotype and T allele in steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) binding site and wild type (WT) in intronic conversion (IC) in CYP11B2 was observed in diabetic patients than controls. However, there was no significant difference in SF-1 and IC genotype among diabetic patients according to the state of diabetic nephropathy. Subgroup analysis based on SF-1 polymorphism demonstrated that TT genotype is associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure and higher plasma aldosterone level. In addition, WT in IC genotype showed a significantly higher urinary albumin excretion rate. Plasma aldosterone level was significantly related with systolic blood pressure. Our study suggests that aldosterone synthase gene polymorphism is not associated with progression of diabetic nephropathy, but it may contribute to the development of hypertension associated with increased aldosterone secretion in type 2 diabetic patients.", "Hypercoagulability in cirrhosis: causes and consequences.\nDecreased levels of most coagulation factors and thrombocytopenia are the main haemostatic abnormalities of cirrhosis. As a consequence, this condition was, until recently, considered as the prototype acquired coagulopathy responsible for bleeding. However, recent evidence suggests that it should, rather, be regarded as a condition associated with normal or even increased thrombin generation. The bleeding events that occur in these patients should, therefore, be explained by the superimposed conditions that frequently occur in this setting. Due to elevated levels of factor VIII (procoagulant driver) in combination with decreased protein C (anticoagulant driver), which are typically found in patients with cirrhosis, a procoagulant imbalance, defined as a partial resistance to the in vitro anticoagulant action of thrombomodulin, can be demonstrated. Whether this in vitro hypercoagulability is truly representative of what occurs in vivo remains to be established. However, the hypothesis that it may have clinical consequences is attractive and deserves attention. The possible consequences that we discuss herein include whether (i) cirrhosis is a condition associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism or portal vein thrombosis; (ii) the hypercoagulability associated with cirrhosis has any other role outside coagulation (i.e. progression of liver fibrosis); and (iii) anticoagulation should be used in cirrhosis. Although apparently provocative, considering anticoagulation as a therapeutic option in patients with cirrhosis is now supported by a rationale of increasing strength. There may be subgroups of patients who benefit from anticoagulation to treat or prevent thrombosis and to slow hepatic fibrosis. Clinical studies are warranted to explore these therapeutic options.", "Comparison of laparoscopic primary and open primary repair of ventral hernias.\nProsthetic materials have gained popularity for ventral hernia repair. There are situations when the use of a mesh is either unnecessary or contraindicated. This study compares 51 patients with ventral hernia who underwent laparoscopic or open primary suture repair. Results were determined by a median follow-up of 33 months. Recurrence rates and operative time were the major parameters of outcome. Mean operative time was insignificantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (14.8 \u00b1 4.3 vs. 15.6 \u00b1 3.7 min). There were no short-term complications in groups. One patient in each group had recurrence. Conclusively, laparoscopic primary repair of small ventral hernias is simple and can be performed as an initial approach for small defects. Compared with open repair, it has the advantages of better exposure, reduced pain, and less morbidity. It can also be performed as a component of a combined laparoscopic operation. However, this technique is not recommended for repair of large ventral hernias.", "Sulfation and attrition of calcium sorbent in a bubbling fluidized bed.\nA bubbling fluidized bed reactor was used as a desulfurization apparatus in this study. The height of the bed was 2.5m, and the inner diameter was 9cm. The bed materials were calcium sorbent and silica sand. The effects of the operating parameters of the flue gas desulfurization including relative humidity, temperature, superficial gas velocity, and the particle size of calcium sorbent on SO2 removal efficiency and calcium sorbent conversion and attrition rate in the fluidized bed were investigated. It was found that the temperature effect in our system was negligible from 40 to 65 degrees C. A higher relative humidity had a higher calcium conversion and a higher sulfur dioxide removal efficiency. Moreover, a smaller particle size of calcium sorbent had a lower calcium conversion in the cyclone but a higher sulfur dioxide removal efficiency. A lower superficial gas velocity resulted in a higher sulfur dioxide removal efficiency and a higher calcium conversion, thus, the total volume of the flue gas treated was maximum near the minimum fluidization velocity. Finally, an attrition rate model proposed in this study could predict the elutriation rate satisfactorily.", "Impact of repetitive thought and processing mode on goal striving.\nStriving to attain personal goals is important for maintaining well-being. Previous research indicates that repetitive thoughts can influence the affect and cognition associated with personal goal strivings. Repetitive thought in the concrete-experiential processing mode improves affect and cognition after a negative event more than does repetitive thought in the abstract-analytic processing mode. We extend this prior work by examining whether repetitive thought directly influences the maintenance of personal goal strivings through a longitudinal survey. In Study 1, we examined the daily maintenance effect of repetitive thought on personal goal strivings using a multilevel analysis of 29 participants who reported their thoughts and goal strivings daily for one week. In Study 2, participants (N = 131) reported their thoughts and goal strivings over 10 weeks, and we examined the maintenance effect of repetitive thought on personal goal strivings every two weeks. Highly repetitive thought in the abstract-analytic processing mode decreased the maintenance of short-term personal goal strivings in individuals with difficult goals. However, highly repetitive thought in the concrete-experiential processing mode increased the maintenance of long-term personal goal strivings in individuals with difficult goals. The study participants were university students; therefore, we cannot generalize the results to clinical populations or other age groups. Interventions that increase repetitive thought in the concrete-experiential processing mode may be effective in facilitating long-term goal strivings in individuals attempting to overcome difficult situations and achieve important personal goals.", "A neurobehavioral intervention and assessment program in very low birth weight infants: outcome at 24 months.\nTo determine whether the Infant Behavioral Assessment and Intervention Program (IBAIP) improves development and behavior in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants at 24-month corrected age. In a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial 86 infants received postdischarge intervention until 6-month corrected age. The intervention consisted of supporting infants' self-regulation and development, and facilitating sensitive parent-infant interactions; 90 control infants received regular care. At 6 months, positive intervention effects were found. At 24 months, development and behavior were evaluated with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II (BSID-II) and the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL). Eighty-three intervention and 78 control infants were available for follow-up. After adjustment for differences in perinatal characteristics, an intervention effect of 6.4 points (+/- standard error, 2.4) on the Psychomotor Developmental Index favored the intervention infants. Groups did not differ on the Mental Developmental Index, the Behavioral Rating Scale of the BSID-II, or on the CBCL. Subgroup analyses revealed improved motor as well as improved mental outcomes in intervention infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and with combined biological and social risk factors. The IBAIP shows sustained motor improvement in VLBW infants until 2-year corrected age.", "A Novel Prodrug Approach for Central Nervous System-Selective Estrogen Therapy.\nBeneficial effects of estrogens in the central nervous system (CNS) results from the synergistic combination of their well-orchestrated genomic and non-genomic actions, making them potential broad-spectrum neurotherapeutic agents. However, owing to unwanted peripheral hormonal burdens by any currently known non-invasive drug administrations, the development of estrogens as safe pharmacotherapeutic modalities cannot be realized until they are confined specifically and selectively to the site of action. We have developed small-molecule bioprecursor prodrugs carrying the para-quinol scaffold on the steroidal A-ring that are preferentially metabolized in the CNS to the corresponding estrogens. Here, we give an overview of our discovery of these prodrugs. Selected examples are shown to illustrate that, independently of the route of administrations and duration of treatments, these agents produce high concentration of estrogens only in the CNS without peripheral hormonal liability. 10\u03b2,17\u03b2-Dihydroxyestra-1,4-dien-3-one (DHED) has been the best-studied representative of this novel type of prodrugs for brain and retina health. Specific applications in preclinical animal models of centrally-regulated and estrogen-responsive human diseases, including neurodegeneration, menopausal symptoms, cognitive decline and depression, are discussed to demonstrate the translational potential of our prodrug approach for CNS-selective and gender-independent estrogen therapy with inherent therapeutic safety.", "Zinc-binding proteins (ligands) in brains of severely zinc-deficient rats.\nPrevious studies from this laboratory reported the presence of a metallothionein-like protein in brain with an apparent estimated molecular weight of 13,000-15,000 daltons. The synthesis of this protein, which incorporates large quantity of cysteine, is stimulated following administration of zinc and copper and is blocked by actinomycin D. In this study, we report that the synthesis of this metallothionein-like protein is considerably lower in brains of severely zinc-deficient rats in comparison with pair-fed orad libitum fed groups. Furthermore, incubation of partially purified metallothionein-like protein with(65)Zn and chromatography on DEAE A-25 Sephadex produced similar elution patterns in the three experimental groups. However, the extent of binding of(65)Zn to the metallothionein-like protein from the zinc-deficient rats was significantly (p<0.05) lower than the control groups. On the other hand, the total concentration of zinc in brains of zinc deficient rats did not vary from control groups. Since the synthesis of this metallothionein-like protein is reduced by zinc deficiency and is stimulated following administration of zinc, we postulate that the free pool of zinc may regulate the synthesis of its binding protein in the brain.", "File sharing is the use of distributing and/or providing access to files stored on a computer or other device. File sharing can be performed by client computers accessing files on a central server, establishing peer-to-peer file sharing between computers with a third party service, placing the files to be shared on removable media and moving this media between computers, etc. One particular use of file sharing is to share files on an ad hoc basis, which is sharing files for a particular purpose or task. For example, it can be useful to setup temporary file sharing between participants in a meeting.\nHowever, as useful as file sharing is between two computers, it can be difficult for an average user to adequately set up ad hoc file sharing on their computer. For example, ad hoc file sharing may require the participating computers to be on the same Wi-Fi network, a person may need to enable file sharing, setup file permission, etc. The more steps that are required to setup ad hoc file sharing, the less likely a computer user will take advantage of this type of file sharing.", "Retrograde signaling in the formation and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction.\nThe neuromuscular junction is characterized by precise alignment between the nerve terminal and the postsynaptic apparatus formed by the muscle fiber. Organization of the neuromuscular junction during embryonic development, growth, and maintenance is coordinated by signals exchanged between motor neurons and their target muscle fibers. Identification of proteins such as agrin, likely to represent neuronal agents that direct the organization of the postsynaptic apparatus, has focused attention on characterization of proteins that mediate retrograde signals that regulate the organization and function of the nerve terminal. The results of these studies implicate a role for both adhesive and diffusible signals in coordinating the development, maturation, and maintenance of the motor nerve terminal. The diversity of molecules identified to date that appear to play a role in these processes implies a considerable level of redundancy in the transduction pathway. However, studies of early nerve-muscle interactions suggest that a common feature of many of these retrograde agents is activation of a protein kinase coupled with an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. While the molecular signals that regulate growth and maintenance of neuromuscular junctions are less well understood it seems likely that similar adhesive and diffusible factors will be involved.", "Dual-patterned immunofiltration (DIF) device for the rapid efficient negative selection of heterogeneous circulating tumor cells.\nThe analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is an emerging field for estimating the metastatic relapse and tumor burden of cancer patients. However, the isolation of CTCs is still challenging due to their ambiguity, rarity, and heterogeneity. Here, we present an anti-CD45 antibody based dual-patterned immunofiltration (DIF) device for the enrichment of heterogeneous CTC subtypes by effective elimination of leukocytes. Our uniquely designed dual-patterned layers significantly enhance the binding chance between immuno-patterns and leukocytes due to the fluidic whirling and the increased binding sites, thus achieving superior negative selection in terms of high-throughput and high purity. From the experiments using lung cancer cells, 97.07 \u00b1 2.79% of leukocytes were eliminated with less than 10% loss of cancerous cells at the flow rate of 1 mL h-1. To verify the device as a potential diagnostic tool, CTCs were collected from 11 cancer patients' blood and an average of 283.3 CTC-like cells were identified while less than 1 CTC-like cells were found from healthy donors. The samples were also analyzed by immunohistochemistry and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to identify their heterogeneous characteristics. These remarkable results demonstrate that the present device could help to understand the unknown properties or undiscovered roles of CTCs with a non-biased view.", "Inhibition of Endocytosis of Clathrin-Mediated Angiotensin II Receptor Type 1 in Podocytes Augments Glomerular Injury.\nInhibition of the renin-angiotensin system remains a cornerstone in reducing proteinuria and progression of kidney failure, effects believed to be the result of reduction in BP and glomerular hyperfiltration. However, studies have yielded conflicting results on whether podocyte-specific angiotensin II (AngII) signaling directly induces podocyte injury. Previous research has found that after AngII stimulation, \u03b2-arrestin-bound angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) is internalized in a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent manner, and that Dynamin1 and Dynamin2 double-knockout mice exhibit impaired clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We used podocyte-specific Dyn double-knockout mice to examine AngII-stimulated AT1R internalization and signaling in primary podocytes and controls. We also examined the in vivo effect of AngII in these double-knockout mice through renin-angiotensin system blockers and through deletion of Agtr1a (which encodes the predominant AT1R isoform expressed in kidney, AT1aR). We tested calcium influx, Rac1 activation, and lamellipodial extension in control and primary podocytes of Dnm double-knockout mice treated with AngII. We confirmed augmented AngII-stimulated AT1R signaling in primary Dnm double-knockout podocytes resulting from arrest of clathrin-coated pit turnover. Genetic ablation of podocyte Agtr1a in Dnm double-knockout mice demonstrated improved albuminuria and kidney function compared with the double-knockout mice. Isolation of podocytes from Dnm double-knockout mice revealed abnormal membrane dynamics, with increased Rac1 activation and lamellipodial extension, which was attenuated in Dnm double-knockout podocytes lacking AT1aR. Our results indicate that inhibiting aberrant podocyte-associated AT1aR signaling pathways has a protective effect in maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier.", "Biosynthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles using Brevibacterium casei.\nThe present study demonstrates an unprecedented green process for the production of spherical-shaped Au and Ag nanoparticles synthesized and stabilized using a bacterium, Brevibacterium casei. Aqueous solutions of chloroaurate ions for Au and Ag(+) ions for silver were treated with B. casei biomass for the formation of Au nanoparticles (AuNP) and Ag nanoparticles (AgNP). The nanometallic dispersions were characterized by surface plasmon absorbance measuring at 420 and 540 nm for Ag and Au nanoparticles, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy showed the formation of nanoparticles in the range of 10-50 nm (silver), and 10-50 nm (gold). XRD analysis of the silver and gold nanoparticles confirmed the formation of metallic silver and gold. Further analysis carried out by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), provides evidence for the presence of proteins as possible biomolecules responsible for the reduction and capping agent which helps in increasing the stability of the synthesized silver and gold nanoparticles. The biological activities of the synthesized particles were confirmed based on their stable anti-coagulant effects. The use of bacterium for nanoparticles synthesis offers the benefits of ecofriendliness and amenability for large-scale production.", "[Interaction between health personnel and young pregnant women during prenatal control: a qualitative study].\nTo explore the interaction between health personnel and young pregnants, beginning from the meanings of sexuality, pregnancy and prenatal control in a Lima National Hospital. A qualitative study was conducted, including observations of the interaction during the consult, in-depth interviews to young pregnants (14) and health personnel (9), and a focus group of young pregnant women. There are perceptions and socio-cultural valuations that don't favor communication between both groups. Health personnel rise as an argument the fact that having prompt sexual relations means that the youngsters assume the role of adults, and also consider that these weren't prepared bio-psychologically and socially to be mothers. In this conception, the body of the youngster is considered a means of control, intervention and power in the presence of the obstetrician. Nevertheless, for the pregnant youngsters it represents its value as future mothers. The meanings of the prenatal control for the health personnel are oriented to the biomedical aspects from the risk approach; emphasizing in the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases; on the other hand, for the teens the behavior of the health staff is important and differs, women offer a kind, warm attention, without overlooking the scientific and cognitive aspects, while males, in most of the cases, have a more operative and cognitive interaction. The interaction between health personnel and pregnant women varies according to the gender of the health staff and has different meanings for the pregnant, which is important to take into account in order to improve the attention in prenatal control of young women.", "Comparison of the morphologic and vascular reactivity of the proximal and distal radial artery.\nVariations in the morphology and vascular reactivity of the proximal and distal radial artery might influence its performance as a bypass conduit. The morphologic and functional characteristics of the proximal and distal RAs were compared with those of the left and right internal mammary arteries by using histologic and in vitro organ bath techniques. Proximal RA had a significantly greater medial cross-sectional area compared with that of the distal RA (2.48+/-0.27 mm2 compared with 1.86+/-0.21 mm2, p< 0.05), which were both significantly greater than the left internal mammary artery (0.54+/-0.09 mm2) or the right internal mammary artery (0.67+/-0.03 mm2). Proximal RA had a significantly greater response to 90 mmol/L potassium chloride than that of distal RA (88.4+/-7.3 compared with 60.2+/-10.3 mN, p<0.05), and both contracted more than the left internal mammary artery (30.3+/-2.9 mN) and the right internal mammary artery (32.6+/-4.1 mN). There was no difference in the response to noradrenaline and adrenaline between proximal and distal RA, both of which contracted more than the left and right internal mammary arteries. When choosing a segment of RA for use as a bypass conduit, regional variations in biologic properties should be considered.", "Surface-mediated functional gene delivery: an effective strategy for enhancing competitiveness of endothelial cells over smooth muscle cells.\nThe non-biorecognition of general biomaterials and inherent biospecificity of biological systems pose key challenges to the optimal functions of medical devices. In this study, we constructed the surface-mediated functional gene delivery through layer-by-layer self-assembly of protamine sulfate (PrS) and plasmid DNA encoding hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), aiming at specific enhancing endothelial cells (EC) compeititiveness over smooth muscle cells (SMC). Characterizations of the (PrS/HGF-pDNA) multilayered films present the linear buildup with homogeneous and flat topographical feature. The amount of DNA can be easily controlled. By using these multilayered films, both human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (HUASMC) can be directly transfected when they contact with the multilayered films. On transfection, increasing secretion of HGF has been detected in both HUVEC and HUASMC culture, which leads to selective promotion of HUVEC proliferation. In the co-culture experiment, we also exhibit the promoted and hindered growth of HUVEC and HUASMC, respectively, which could be attributed to the inverse influence of HUVEC on HUASMC. These results collectively demonstrate that our system can be served as a powerful tool for enhancing competitiveness of EC over SMC, which opens perspectives for the regulation of intercellular competitiveness in the field of interventional therapy.", "Multisector prostate dosimetric quality: analysis of a large community database.\nTo evaluate multi-institutional prostate brachytherapy dosimetric quality using multisector analysis. In the database, 4547 patients underwent brachytherapy (3094 for (125)I, 1437 for (103)Pd, and 16 for (131)Cs). The original prostate postimplant dosimetry was reported using the maximum dose covering 90% of the prostate volume (D90) and the percentage of the prostate volume covered by the prescription dose (V100). Retrospectively, the dosimetry of all implants was recalculated after segmenting the prostate into 12 sectors (anterior, left and right lateral and posterior, about the center of gravity, and subdivided lengthwise into three-base, midgland, and apex). The dosimetric quality of each sector and combinations of sectors was compared across radionuclides. For each radionuclide, there was no significant difference between monotherapy and boost in terms of V100 or D90. When classified as excellent (V100 \u2265 90%), standard (V100 \u2265 80%), or minimal (V100 < 80%), 33.0%, 4.6%, and 10.5% of all base, midgland, and apical sectors, respectively, were of minimal quality. Specifically, 59.2% of the anterior base and 30.3% of the posterior base sectors were minimal. At the anterior midgland and apex, 22% and 19% of sectors were minimal. Excellent quality was observed in more than 90% of lateral and posterior midgland sectors and in >70% of lateral and posterior sectors. When stratified by (103)Pd vs. (125)I, sector analysis did not result in clinically significant dosimetric differences. Coverage of base sectors was inferior to midgland and apical sectors, and coverage of anterior sectors was notably inferior to lateral and posterior sectors. Further critique of brachytherapy planning and intraoperative technique is necessary for brachytherapists to minimize these dosimetric differences.", "Dynamic renal blood flow measurement by positron emission tomography in patients with CRF.\nPositron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging device that allows dynamic regional blood flow measurements. We performed a study to test whether PET could detect acute changes in renal blood flow (RBF) in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). RBF was measured by means of PET (PET-RBF) using oxygen 15-labeled water (H2(15)O) in eight men with hypertension and moderate CRF before and 5, 40, 80, and 120 minutes after the injection of quinaprilat (10 mg intravenously). Effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured simultaneously by para-aminohippuric acid (PAH-ERPF) and inulin clearances before and 20, 60, 100, and 140 minutes after quinaprilat injection. Baseline RBF and ERPF were decreased in all patients (221 +/- 20 mL/min/100 g and 225 +/- 38 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively). PET-RBF increased significantly after quinaprilat injection (+15%, +26%, +19%, and +23% versus baseline; P < 0.003). PAH-ERPF did not increase significantly (-6%, +12%, +20%, and +15% versus baseline; P = 0.15). GFR (50.1 +/- 8.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline) did not change significantly after quinaprilat injection; however, filtration fraction (GFR-ERPF ratio) decreased significantly from 0.23% +/- 0.02% to 0.20% +/- 0.02% (P = 0.0004). Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly after quinaprilat injection (P < 0.005). This study dynamically measured RBF by means of PET in patients with CRF for the first time. It showed that RBF rapidly increased after quinaprilat injection. PET using H2(15)O is a powerful method for the noninvasive measurement of dynamic changes in RBF that remain undetected by PAH clearance.", "Stability of multivariable fractional polynomial models with selection of variables and transformations: a bootstrap investigation.\nSauerbrei and Royston have recently described an algorithm, based on fractional polynomials, for the simultaneous selection of variables and of suitable transformations for continuous predictors in a multivariable regression setting. They illustrated the approach by analyses of two breast cancer data sets. Here we extend their work by considering how to assess possible instability in such multivariable fractional polynomial models. We first apply the algorithm repeatedly in many bootstrap replicates. We then use log-linear models to investigate dependencies among the inclusion fractions for each predictor and among the simplified classes of fractional polynomial function chosen in the bootstrap samples. To further evaluate the results, we define measures of instability based on a decomposition of the variability of the bootstrap-selected functions in relation to a reference function from the original model. For each data set we are able to identify large, reasonably stable subsets of the bootstrap replications in which the functional forms of the predictors appear fairly stable. Despite the considerable flexibility of the family of fractional polynomials and the consequent risk of overfitting when several variables are considered, we conclude that the multivariable selection algorithm can find stable models.", "The impact of readmission hospital on failure-to-rescue rates following major urologic cancer surgery.\nPatients readmitted to secondary hospitals rather than the primary hospital where their surgery took place may be at risk for poorer outcomes. We sought to evaluate the effect of site of readmission on failure-to-rescue complication rates following urologic cancer surgery. Retrospective review of major urologic cancer surgeries in the Washington State Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System between 1998 and 2013. Failure-to-rescue (FTR) rates, defined as inpatient death after a complication requiring hospital readmission, were compared between patients readmitted to their primary hospital with those readmitted to a secondary hospital. Multivariable logistic regression (MVA) models evaluated the association between readmission site and FTR. Of 31,498 eligible patients, 3,113 patients were readmitted to hospital within 90 days of surgery, of whom 29.2% were readmitted to a secondary hospital. The highest FTR rates were following cardiac (11.6%), respiratory (11.2%), and sepsis-related complications (10.0%). When limiting to patients who underwent surgery in a high-volume center, the odds of FTR were 4-fold higher when complications were managed in a secondary hospital (OR = 4.06, 95% CI: 1.67-9.89). The institution where patients present for postoperative complications is associated with differential mortality outcomes. Upon validation in a large cohort, these findings may inform quality improvement initiatives that target postoperative readmissions, algorithm-based approaches to post-surgical management of complications, and guide clinical decision-making around hospital transfers.", "Detection of D-amino acids in purified proteins synthesized in Escherichia coli.\nIt has long been believed that amino acids comprising proteins of all living organisms are only of the L-configuration, except for Gly. However, peptidyl D-amino acids were observed in hydrolysates of soluble high molecular weight fractions extracted from cells or tissues of various organisms. This strongly suggests that significant amounts of D-amino acids are naturally present in usual proteins. Thus we analyzed the D-amino acid contents of His-tag-purified beta-galactosidase and human urocortin, which were synthesized by Escherichia coli grown in controlled synthetic media. After acidic hydrolysis for various times at 110 degrees C, samples were derivatized with 4-fluoro-7-nitro-2, 1, 3-benzoxadiazole (NBD-F) and separated on a reverse-phase column followed by a chiral column into D- and L-enantiomers. The contents of D-enantiomers of Ala, Leu, Phe, Val, Asp, and Glu were determined by plotting index D/(D + L) against the incubation time for hydrolysis and extrapolating the linear regression line to 0 h to eliminate the effect of racemization of amino acids during the incubation. Significant contents of D-amino acids were reproducibly detected, the D-amino acid profile being specific to an individual protein. This finding indicated the likelihood that D-amino acids are in fact present in the purified proteins. On the other hand, the D-amino acid contents of proteins were hardly influenced by the addition of D- or L-amino acids to the cultivation medium, whereas intracellular free D-amino acids sensitively varied according to the extracellular conditions. The origin of these D-amino acids detected in proteins was discussed.", "IGF-I, 17beta-estradiol and progesterone in SHR and in rats treated with L-NAME: fetal-placental development.\nThe relationship between progesterone (P4), 17beta-estradiol, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) and embryonic and fetal development, were examined. Female Sprague Dawley rats were divided into two groups: control untreated (n=60) and treated (n=63) with L-NAME (N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester), 15 mg/day in drinking water from the first day after mating to day 18 of gestation. A further group was formed (n=63) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Mean systolic blood pressure was recorded daily. On days 6, 11 and 18 of pregnancy, the number of sites of implantation, litter and placenta weight was examined. In addition, serum levels of P4, 17beta-estradiol and IGF-I were determined. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) (mmHg) increased significantly in L-NAME and SHR rats over the course of the experiment. On day 6 of pregnancy, in the L-NAME group the number of implantation sites, levels of IGF-I and 17beta-estradiol were significantly lower than in the control group. In SHR, only the concentration of IGF-I was low (p<0.05). In contrast, on day 11 of pregnancy no variation was found in the parameters under study. On day 18 of gestation, a significant decrease in litter and placenta weight, concentration of P4 and IGF-I was observed in the experimental groups. The data further suggest that nitric oxide might regulate IGF-I production, indicating that growth factors may play an important role in fetal-placental development.", "Preparation of uniform haemoglobin free human erythrocyte ghosts in isotonic solution.\nA method is described for the preparation of haemoglobin free human erythrocyte ghosts in isotonic solutions using dielectric breakdown technique. In this single haemolytic procedure, almost complete removal of haemoglobin (less than or equal to 0.1%) was achieved by subjecting the erythrocytes suspended in phosphate buffered, isotonic KCl solution at 0 degrees C to three consecutive electrical field pulses of 16 kV/cm in the presence of 10 mM EDTA; EDTA was used to prevent electrical haemolysis. Haemolysis is induced by subsequent dilution with isotonic and isoionic solution to lower the EDTA concentration. Haemolysis is complete after 5 min; the cells are centrifuged, washed and resuspended in a solution of the same composition and osmolarity containing 4 mM MgCl2, but no EDTA. The resealing process, carried out at 37 degrees C, was complete in about 1 h. Measurements of the size distribution of the ghost cells in the hydrodynamically focusing Coulter Counter at varying field strengths in the orifice revealed that the ghost population is nearly uniform. The mean (modal) volume of the ghost cells was 110--120 micronm3 when suspended in phosphate buffered NaCl solution. The apparent breakdown voltage was about 1.3 V.", "Dose-dependent adsorptive capacity of activated charcoal for gastrointestinal decontamination of a simulated paracetamol overdose in human volunteers.\nThe amount of activated charcoal needed to treat drug overdoses has arbitrarily been set at a charcoal-drug ratio of 10:1. Recent in vitro studies have shown a larger adsorptive capacity for activated charcoal when used in a model of paracetamol overdose. In the present study, we investigated whether this reserve capacity exists in vivo. This is clinically relevant in cases of large overdoses or if the full standard dose of 50 g activated charcoal cannot be administered. We performed a randomized, cross-over study (n = 16). One hour after a standard breakfast, 50 mg/kg paracetamol was administered, followed 1 hr later by an activated charcoal-Water slurry containing 50 (control), 25 or 5 g activated charcoal. The areas under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) for paracetamol were used to estimate the efficacy of each activated charcoal dose. The AUC of the 25-g dose was found to be of similar size compared to the control, although statistics were weak. The AUC of the 5-g dose was 59% larger than the AUC of the 50-g dose (p = 0.0003). The terminal elimination half-life (t(1/2)) of paracetamol was 1.6 (CI 1.4-2.0) and 1.9 (CI 1.5-2.4) hr for 50 and 25 g, respectively (NS), and 2.5 (CI 1.8-3.0) hr for the 5-g dose (p = 0.003). The decrease in t(1/2) of paracetamol for the two larger activated charcoal doses indicates a possible effect of activated charcoal on paracetamol clearance and warrants further investigation. The large adsorptive reserve capacity of activated charcoal in vitro could not be reproduced for the smallest dose of activated charcoal. An activated charcoal-drug ratio of 10:1 is therefore still recommendable.", "Dynamics of time discrimination.\nPigeons tracked sinusoidal sequences of interfood intervals (IFIs) by pausing in each interval for a time proportional to the preceding interval. Schedules with either long (30-90 s) or short (5-15 s) values, with variable numbers of cycles and starting phase each day, were tracked about equally well. Tracking was apparently immediate and did not improve across sessions. Experiment 2, in which long and short series were presented on alternate days, showed that tracking on long was more impaired than on short. Experiment 3 showed that occasional presentation of a short IFI in a series of fixed, longer IFIs caused a reduction in waiting time in the next IFI. These effects are evidence for a fast-acting timing mechanism in which waiting time in the IFI N + 1 is strongly determined by the preceding IFI, N. Earlier IFIs have some cumulative effect, but the details remain to be elucidated.", "Accounting for the missing opportunity costs in incremental cost-outcome analysis.\nWhen used to assess the value for money of cost-increasing health care interventions, incremental cost-outcome analysis (i.e. cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses) overlooks potentially important opportunity costs. Consequently, a reliance on this method in practical decision making may serve to sustain otherwise avoidable inefficiencies. To mitigate this problem, a net quality adjusted life year (QALY) approach (or, more generally, a net outcome approach) to health economic evaluation is recommended. Moreover, existing empirical evidence in the experimental economics and psychology literature suggests that people will attach a disutility of significantly greater magnitude to outcomes that are perceived as losses, than the utility they attach to gains of the same absolute size. The net QALY approach ought to be modified to account for those circumstances where health outcomes may be valued differentially according to whether they are perceived as already 'owned', or as merely 'potential'. The importance of this modification is discussed here by way of example.", "Case report: the lupus anticoagulant-hypoprothrombinemia syndrome.\nThe lupus anticoagulant is a well-described in vitro phenomenon that may be associated with arterial and venous thrombotic episodes. The lupus anticoagulant is never accompanied by a hemorrhagic diathesis unless it is associated with a second coagulation abnormality such as thrombocytopenia or hypoprothrombinemia. The lupus anticoagulant-hypoprothrombinemia syndrome is now a well-defined entity that may cause a severe, life-threatening hemorrhagic diathesis. The hypoprothrombinemia in this syndrome is the result of rapid clearance of prothrombin-antiprothrombin antibody complexes by the reticulo-endothelial system. The cause of antiprothrombin antibody formation is unknown. The authors describe a recent experience with a patient with this syndrome who initially had recurrent, life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding. They were able to demonstrate hypoprothrombinemia and the presence of prothrombin-antiprothrombin antibody immune complexes. The patient was treated with prednisone, with correction of the bleeding disorder; however, the patient had resultant death from thrombosis. A literature review of the past 30 years as it relates to the discovery and treatment of this phenomenon is included.", "Enhanced mitochondrial radical production in patients which rheumatoid arthritis correlates with elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha in plasma.\nMitochondrial dysfunction contributes to cell damage in a number of human diseases. One significant mechanism by which mitochondria damage cells is by producing reactive oxygen species from the respiratory chain. In this study we measured the production of reactive oxygen species by leukocyte mitochondria in blood from rheumatoid arthritis patients. To do this we used the chemiluminescence of lucigenin, which is accumulated by mitochondria within cells and reacts with superoxide to form a chemiluminescent product. By using specific inhibitors we could distinguish between the production of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria and by NADPH oxidase. There was a five-fold increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production in whole blood and monocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, when compared to healthy subjects or patients with non-rheumatic diseases. There was no increases in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production by neutrophils from rheumatoid arthritis patients. The enhanced mitochondrial radical production in rheumatoid arthritis patients correlated significantly with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha in plasma (p < 0.0001). As tumor necrosis factor alpha is known to increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production the elevated mitochondrial radical formation seen in rheumatoid arthritis patients may be due to activation of the mitochondrial radical production. These data suggest that elevated mitochondrial oxidative stress contributes to the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis.", "The use of a one-day luteinizing hormone assay for timing of artificial insemination in infertility patients.\nA 1-day rapid assay for luteinizing hormone (RLH) was developed by combined alteration of incubation temperatures and immune-complex precipitation of a commercially available LH kit. The RLH assay, compared with the standard 3-day assay, had the following characteristics: standard curve slope values of --2.47 and --2.314; assay sensitivity of 5.5 and 3.8 mIU/ml of serum; average coefficients of variation for the standard curves of 13.6% and 14.1% and for serum controls of 10.6% and 13.1%, respectively. Two consecutive RLH assays of split samples were highly correlated (r = 0.9908; P less than 0.001), as were split aliquots measured by RLH or the 3-day assay (r = 0.993; P less than 0.001). When 52 samples from portions of 5 normal menstrual cycles were assayed in both systems, agreement was again high (r = 0.9871; P less than 0.001). Representative curves of both RLH and standard LH assays, together with other data, are presented to show the feasibility of applying this method for timing of artificial insemination.", "QSAR study of heparanase inhibitors activity using artificial neural networks and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.\nA linear and non-linear quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study is presented for modeling and predicting heparanase inhibitors' activity. A data set that consisted of 92 derivatives of 2,3-dihydro-1,3-dioxo-1H-isoindole-5-carboxylic acid, furanyl-1,3-thiazol-2-yl and benzoxazol-5-yl acetic acids is used in this study. Among a large number of descriptors, four parameters classified as physico-chemical, topological and electronic indices are chosen using stepwise multiple regression technique. The artificial neural networks (ANNs) model shows superiority over the multiple linear regressions (MLR) by accounting 87.9% of the variances of antiviral potency of the heparanase inhibitors. This paper focuses on investigating the role of weight update functions in developing ANNs. Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm shows a better performance compared with basic back propagation (BBP) and conjugate gradient (CG) algorithms. The accuracy of 4-3-1 L-M ANN model was illustrated using leave-one-out (LOO), leave-multiple-out (LMO) cross-validations and Y-randomization. The mean effect of descriptors and sensitivity analysis show that log P is the most important parameter affecting the inhibitory behavior of the molecules.", "Sevoflurane based anaesthesia does not affect already impaired cerebral autoregulation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nThe baroreflex regulates arterial blood pressure (BP). During periods when blood pressure changes, cerebral blood flow (CBF) is kept constant by cerebral autoregulation (CA). In patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), low baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is associated with impaired CA. As sevoflurane-based anaesthesia obliterates BRS, we hypothesised that this could aggravate the already impaired CA in patients with DM resulting in a 'double-hit' on cerebral perfusion leading to increased fluctuations in blood pressure and cerebral perfusion. On the day before surgery, we measured CBF velocity (CBFV), heart rate, and BP to determine BRS and CA efficacy (CBFVmean-to-BPmean-phase lead) in 25 patients with DM and in 14 controls. During the operation, BRS and CA efficacy were determined during sevoflurane-based anaesthesia. Patients with DM were divided into a group with high BRS (DMBRS\u2191) and a group with low BRS (DMBRS\u2193). Values presented are median (inter-quartile range). Preoperative vs intraoperative BRS was 6.2 (4.5-8.5) vs 1.9 (1.1-2.5, P<0.001) ms mm Hg-1 for controls, 5.8 (4.9-7.6) vs 2.7 (1.5-3.9, P<0.001) ms mm Hg-1 for patients with DMBRS\u2191, and 1.9 (1.5-2.8) vs 1.1 (0.6-2.5, P=0.31) ms mm Hg-1 for patients with DMBRS\u2193. Preoperative vs intraoperative CA efficacy was 43\u00b0 (38-46) vs 43\u00b0 (38-51, P=0.30), 44\u00b0 (36-49) vs 41\u00b0 (32-49, P=0.52), and 34\u00b0 (28-40) vs 30\u00b0 (27-38, P=0.64) for controls, DMBRS\u2191, and DMBRS\u2193 patients, respectively. In diabetic patients with low preoperative BRS, preoperative CA efficacy was also impaired. In controls and diabetic patients, CA was unaffected by sevoflurane-based anaesthesia. We therefore conclude that sevoflurane-based anaesthesia does not contribute to a 'double-hit' phenomenon on cerebral perfusion. NCT 03071432.", "Bioelectrical impedance variation in healthy subjects during 12 h in the supine position.\nBioelectrical impedance analysis is used to assess human body composition. Studies have shown that meal ingestion and change of body posture affects bioelectrical impedance, but none has studied bioelectrical impedance variation in supine subjects. The aim was to examine the bioelectrical impedance variation in healthy subjects during 12 h in the supine position. Bioelectrical impedance was measured 16 times during 12 h in 18 healthy subjects. An identical meal was given at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Mean (standard deviation) impedance at 50 kHz increased from 558 (87) omega at study start to 584 (95) Omega at study end (P<0.05). Bioelectrical impedance is reduced after ingestion of the first meal, but not following the meals at 1230 and 1730. Calculated body fat content increased from a baseline mean (SD) of 21.7 (6.1) % body fat to 23.9 (6.7) % body fat at study end (P<0.05). Bioelectrical impedance increased during 12 h in supine subjects. The increase is probably explained by a shift in body fluids from the extremities to thorax during the day and the importance of strict measurement standardisation both in epidemiological studies and clinical practice is underlined.", "Body fat composition and occurrence of kidney stones in hypercalciuric children.\nIn the last 10 years, the incidence of kidney stones has increased in the pediatric population, and this rise has been paralleled by a significant increase in pediatric obesity rates in the USA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate percentage body fat (%BF) measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in hypercalciuric children with and without kidney stones. A retrospective chart review was performed on children with idiopathic hypercalciuria based on a 24-h urine calcium excretion of >4 mg/kg/day or >200 mg/day who had undergone DXA scanning. Patients were then classified by sex and by %BF (3 categories; normal: <27% girls, <21% boys; at risk for obesity: 27-36% girls, 21-30% boys; obese: >36% girls, >30% boys). The 2003-2004 NHANES data were used as a control. Fifty patients (24 males) were analyzed, of whom 26% were assessed as having a normal %BF, 44% as being at risk for obesity, and 30% as being obese. Children with an increased %BF had a significantly higher occurrence of kidney stones (p = 0.03) than those with a normal %BF. No significant differences were noted in 24-h urine chemistries between the groups. In conclusion, an increased %BF was associated with an increased occurrence of kidney stones in children with idiopathic hypercalciuria.", "[Treatment-refractory OCD and its biological pathophysiology].\nRecently, ample evidence has suggested that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavioral therapy are highly effective treatments for OCD. There are, however, certain patients who are refractory to almost all types of therapeutic intervention. In recent studies, atypical antipsychotic augmentation of SSRIs and deep brain stimulation have been suggested to be effective for these refractory-type patients. Dysfunction of neuro-circuits throughout the frontal cortex and associated subcortical structures is considered to be due to both serotonergic and dopaminergic nerve system impairment. A large number of previous neuroimaging studies identified abnormally high metabolic activities throughout the frontal cortex as well as subcortical and limbic structures. These over-activities are suggested to be biological markers of the treatment response. In addition, structural and nerve connective dysfunction of these regions may be associated with a severe, treatment-resistant, and treatment-refractory status. A treatment-refractory state may be attributable to the clinical subtypes of OCD. Associations between the symptom subtype and brain activity reveal the heterogeneity of OCD. Several correlative analyses have shown distinct neural correlations associated with specific OCD symptom dimensions such as aggression/checking, contamination/cleaning, and hoarding. Overlapping of these neural disturbances will cause treatment-refractory OCD. Another reason for a treatment-refractory state may be comorbid disorders such as major depression and tic disorders. Comorbid depression will aggravate metabolic impairments in the hippocampus and thalamus and cause more severe disturbance of neuro-circuits in OCD. Obsessive-compulsive symptom with Tourette syndrome or pervasive developmental disorders will become refractory because of fixation caused by developmental factors and a perceptual element called \"just right feeling\". There should be a close relationship between neuro-circuit disturbance and a treatment-refractory state. The pathophysiology becomes more complicated due to the symptom subtype and comorbidity. Further investigations are needed to develop effective treatment strategies based on biological evidence.", "Nonpolar dihydrogen bonds--on a gliding scale from weak dihydrogen interaction to covalent H-H in symmetric radical cations [HnE-H-H-EHn]+.\nThe electronic structures and bonding patterns for a new class of radical cations, [HnE-H-H-EHn]+ (EHn=element hydride, E=element of Groups 15-18), have been investigated by applying quantum-chemical methods. All structures investigated give rise to symmetric potential energy minimum structures. We envisage clear periodic trends. The H--H bond length is shorter for elements toward the bottom of the periodic table of elements, and a short H--H bond corresponds to accumulation of electron density in the central H--H region. All [HnE-H-H-EHn]+ of Groups 15-17 are thermodynamically unstable towards loss of either H2 or H. The barriers for these dissociations are rather low. The Group 18 congeners, except E=Xe, appear to be global minima of the respective potential energy surfaces. The findings are discussed in terms of H2 bond activation, and a general mechanistic scheme for the standard reduction process 2H+ + 2e(-) --> H2 is given. Finally, it is proposed that some of the symmetric radical cations are likely to be observed in mass spectrometric or matrix isolation experiments.", "[Factor structure and psychometric properties of the ICD-10-Symptom-Rating (ISR) in samples of psychosomatic patients].\nThe ICD-10-Symptom-Rating (ISR) is a self-rating questionnaire for patients. According to its conceptualization, the instrument was developed to closely represent the syndrome structure of the ICD-10 while assessing the extent of psychological distress an individual suffers from. The results of different factor analyses testing the postulated syndrome structure as well as item and scale characteristics are reported here. Data was collected from a consecutive sample of 1 057 psychosomatic patients of the University Hospital Charit\u00e9 Berlin. Evaluation of the dimensional structure of the questionnaire included exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses each computed with a randomized half of the sample. Multi-Sample-Analyses with different subgroups of the sample were performed to test the stability of the factor structure. The individual factors were constituted by the postulated syndrome units of the ICD-10 involving a high and uniform distribution of accounted variance. They also proved themselves satisfactorily stable over the different subsamples. The scales showed a high degree of internal consistency with relatively small gender and age effects, while psychological disorders had a large effect on the means of the scales. Taking a perspective of test theory, the ICD-10-Symptom-Rating is in accordance with the syndrome structure of the ICD-10 and suitable for the assessment of psychological symptoms. Other aspects pertaining to the reliability and validity of the ISR remain to be proven in future research.", "The negative inotropic effect of esmolol on isolated cardiac muscle.\nEsmolol is an ultra-short-term acting beta adrenergic blocker for intravenous use. The most common side effect is hypotension, which is often manageable by careful titration of the dose. We speculated whether esmolol had a direct negative inotropic effect on the cardiac muscle. Papillary muscles and trabeculae were excised from guinea pig and pig hearts. Force production was recorded together with action potentials. Membrane currents were recorded in isolated myocytes. The effects of two concentrations of esmolol were tested (55 and 110 micromol/L). Esmolol reduced action potential duration and plateau voltage, and decreased force production of isolated cardiac muscle. Voltage-clamp experiments from a holding potential of -40 mV and a step change to 0 mV showed a reduction in the inward current due to esmolol. Apart from being a beta adrenergic blocker esmolol also exerts a direct negative inotropic effect on cardiac muscle due to its inhibition of the calcium current during the action potential.", "Monocyte chemotactic and activating factor/monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCAF/MCP-1) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with atopic asthma and chronic bronchitis.\nMonocyte chemotactic and activating factor/monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCAF/MCP-1) is a member of the beta (C-C) subfamily of chemokines. The biological roles played by MCAF/MCP-1 in a number of inflammatory and noninflammatory diseases states is not well known. Several studies have confirmed that inflammation is present in the airways of subjects with atopic asthma and with chronic bronchitis. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is an effective method of sampling lower respiratory tract inflammation. The aim of this study was to examine associations among MCAF/MCP-1, BALF cells and spirometry parameters and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in patients with atopic asthma and chronic bronchitis. Twenty patients with atopic asthma, 10 patients with chronic bronchitis and 10 patients of the control group, took part in this study. An ELISA test was used to assess MCAF/MCP-1 in BALF. The levels of MCAF/ MCP-1 (mean +/- SEM) were 150 +/- 18.6 pg/ml in patients with atopic asthma, 320 +/- 39.7 pg/ml in chronic bronchitis and 74.9 +/- 3.3 pg/ml in the control group (p < 0.05). When all patients with disease were considered, there was negative correlation with FEF50 (Kendall's correlation coefficient = - 0.4; p < 0.01). Regression analysis has shown that a level of MCAF/MCP-1 over 100 pg/ml was correlated with duration of illness (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.7; p < 0.02). In conclusion, MCAF/MCP-1 probably possesses proinflammatory properties in atopic asthma and chronic bronchitis. The elevated level of this chemokine may support the clinical suspicion of specific diagnosis.", "Investigation of preparation parameters of nanosuspension by top-down media milling to improve the dissolution of poorly water-soluble glyburide.\nThe objective of this study was to identify and optimize formulation and process variables affecting characteristic and scale-up of nanosuspension manufacturing process on bead mill considering industrial perspective. Formulation factors evaluated were ratio of polymer to drug and ratio of surfactant to drug, whereas process parameters were milling time and milling speed. Responses measured in this study include zeta potential and mean particle size d(90). The test revealed that ratio of polymer to drug and milling speed have significant effect on zeta potential whereas milling time and milling speed have significant effect on the particle size distribution of nanosuspension. The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of drug milled at high and low speed reveals no form conversion when compared with unmilled drug. The formulated nanosuspension has shown a faster dissolution profile (98.97% in 10 min), relative to that of raw glyburide (18.17% in 10 min), mainly due to the formation of nanosized particles. The ANOVA test revealed that there was no significant difference in the dissolution profiles of fresh and aged nanosuspension. These results indicate the suitability of formulation procedure for preparation of nanosized poorly water-soluble drug with significantly improved in vitro dissolution rate and thus possibly enhance fast onset of therapeutic drug effect.", "Serum antim\u00fcllerian hormone is associated with the number of oocytes matured in vitro and with primordial follicle density in candidates for fertility preservation.\nTo assess whether serum antim\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) levels and antral follicle count (AFC) can predict primordial follicle density within ovarian cortex and the number of oocytes cryopreserved after in vitro maturation (IVM). Retrospective analysis of a case series of patients. University hospital. Fifty-four women, 18 to 35 years of age, with breast cancer who were candidates for fertility preservation (FP) using ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) associated with oocyte vitrification after unstimulated IVM between July 2013 and December 2016. Serum AMH levels and transvaginal AFC evaluated before FP, cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) recovered under ultrasound guidance and incubated for IVM, and ovarian tissue laparoscopically harvested and cryopreserved. Univariate and multivariate analysis between ovarian reserve tests, number of recovered and in vitro matured oocytes, and primordial follicle density histologically obtained within ovarian cortex. Univariate analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between AMH or AFC and primordial follicle density. Multivariate analysis showed a predominant statistically significant correlation of serum AMH with density. Antim\u00fcllerian hormone also correlated with the number of COC and in vitro matured oocytes. Serum AMH levels may reflect the primordial follicle stockpile and may predict outcomes of IVM and OTC when performed for FP. Further analyses are required to evaluate the relevance of performing such procedures in young women who have low values on ovarian reserve tests.", "The conjugate Rituximab/saporin-S6 completely inhibits clonogenic growth of CD20-expressing cells and produces a synergistic toxic effect with Fludarabine.\nImmunotoxins are chimeric proteins consisting of a toxin coupled to an antibody. To date, several clinical trials have been conducted, and some are still ongoing, to evaluate their anti-tumor efficacy. In this view, we chemically constructed an anti-CD20 immunotoxin with the mAb Rituximab and the type 1 ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) saporin-S6, designed for B cells non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) therapy. This immunotoxin showed a specific cytotoxicity for the CD20+ cell lines Raji and D430B, evidenced by inhibition of protein synthesis, evaluation of apoptosis and clonogenic assay. Upon conjugation, saporin-S6 increased its toxicity on target cells by at least 2 logs, with IC(50) values of 0.1-0.3 nM. The percentage of AnnexinV+ cells was over 95% in both cell lines treated with 10 nM immunotoxin. A complete elimination of Raji clones was reached with the 10 nM immunotoxin, whereas a mixture of free RIP and mAb gave about 90% of clonogenic growth. Rituximab/saporin-S6, at 10 nM concentration, also induced apoptosis in 80% of lymphoma cells from NHL patients. Moreover, sensitivity of Raji to Rituximab/saporin-S6 was augmented when cells were coincubated with Fludarabine. The synergistic toxic effect of the two drugs led to a total elimination of the neoplastic population.", "We are investigating various aspects of the molecular and cellular basis for somatosensation. These studies have included further investigation of itch signaling, examination of the primary neurons involved in detection of thermal stimulation, and determination of several molecular characteristics of mechanosensation. Our studies have used a variety of techniques aimed at determining the cellular and the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes. We are using optogenetics and chemogenetics to precisely define neuronal involvement and the location of these units in sensory pathways. Using mutant mice lacking genes in specific tissues has allowed us to pinpoint and validate the contribution of signaling components. Pharmacological characterization and selective cellular ablation has further allowed us to explore the processes taking place in these pathways. Lastly, we have been using cell-sorting of genetically labeled neurons coupled with NextGen sequencing to search for novel molecules required for the detection, signaling, and transmission of somatosensory stimuli. Our studies reveal that somatosensory discrimination is achieved at the periphery by sensory neurons which detect specific stimuli and transmit signals to dedicated signaling pathways.", "Characterization of taurine as inhibitor of sodium glucose transporter.\nThe most characterized roles of taurine include osmoregulator and membrane-stabilizing activities. However, much remains to be understood about its role in human physiology concerning its anti-hyperglycemic effect. Studies indicate that taurine-supplemented diet helps alleviate hyperglycemia or insulin resistance. This hypoglycemic effect has been postulated as taurine helping to increase the excretion of cholesterol. Alternatively, this study investigated the effect of taurine on glucose transporter using heterologous expression of sodium-glucose transporter-1 (SGLT-1). SGLT-1 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and the effect of taurine on the expressed SGLT-1 was analyzed utilizing 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DOG) uptake and voltage clamp studies. In the oocytes expressing SGLT-1, taurine was shown to inhibit SGLT-1 activity compared to the non-treated controls in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of taurine, the glucose uptake was greatly inhibited and the glucose-generated current was significantly inhibited. Synthetic taurine analogs were also shown to be effective in inhibiting SGLT-1 activity in a manner comparable to taurine. These effects might offer a promising opportunity in designing functional foods with anti-hyperglycemic potential by supplementing taurine and its analogs to the diet.", "Structure and photochemical properties of (mu-alkoxo)bis(mu-carboxylato)diruthenium complexes with naphthylacetate ligands.\nTwo new dinuclear Ru(III) complexes containing naphthalene moieties, K[Ru2(dhpta)(mu-O2CCH2-1-naph)2] (1) and K[Ru2(dhpta)(mu-O2CCH2-2-naph)2] (2) (H5dhpta = 1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, naph-1-CH2CO2H = 1-naphthylacetic acid, naph-2-CH2CO2H = 2-naphthylacetic acid), were synthesized. Complex 2 crystallized as an orthorhombic system having a space group of Pbca with unit cell parameters a = 10.6200(5) A, b = 20.270(1) A, c = 35.530(2) A, and Z = 8. EXAFS analysis of 1 and 2 in the solid states and in solution clarified that the dinuclear structures of 1 and 2 were kept in DMSO solutions. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility data indicated that the two Ru(III) centers are strongly antiferromagnetically coupled as shown by the large coupling constants, J = -581 cm(-1) (1) and -378 cm(-1) (2). In the cyclic voltammograms of 1 and 2, one oxidation peak and two reduction peaks which were assigned to the redox reaction of the ruthenium moieties were observed in DMF. The large conproportionation constants estimated from the reduction potentials of Ru(III)Ru(III) and Ru(III)Ru(II) indicated the great stability of the mixed-valent state. The mixed-valent species [Ru(III)Ru(II)(dhpta)(mu-O2CCH2-R)2](2-) (R = 1-naph (6) and R = 2-naph (7)) were prepared by controlled potential electrolysis of 1 and 2 in DMF. The electronic absorption spectra of 6 and 7 were similar to that of [Ru(III)Ru(II) (dhpta)(mu-O2CCH3)2](2-) which is a typical Class II type mixed-valent complex. The fluorescence decay of 1 and 2 indicated that there are two quenching processes which come from the excimer and monomer states. The short excimer lifetimes of 1 and 2 were ascribed to the energy transfer from the naphthyl moieties to the Ru centers. The different excimer ratio between 1 and 2 suggested that the excimer formation is affected by the conformation of the naphthyl moieties in the diruthenium(III) complexes.", "Characteristics of elderly inpatients at high risk of needing supportive social and health care services.\nA two-stage cross-sectional study was conducted in a 951-bed acute-care hospital: a first survey designed to determine the profile of patients aged > or = 64 years needing supportive social/health care services, in which 38 patients discharged between June and July, 1992 (group 1) with social/health care problems that accounted for inappropriate hospitalization days participated, and a second survey designed to identify patients aged > or = 65 years at high risk and thus facilitating the early intervention of social workers, in which 153 patients selected at random and interviewed between August and September, 1992 (group 2) participated. A significantly higher percentage of group 1 patients had no medical insurance, were admitted to hospital for treatment, lived alone, had been readmitted in the previous 6 months, suffered from dementia and/or cognitive impairment, presented with associated chronic illnesses, and showed lower Barthel index scores as compared to group 2 patients. In patients in group 2, hospital discharge was delayed due to the need of supportive social and health care services in only 27 patients. The percentage of agreement in the suitability of the resource provided was higher after (92.6%) than before the intervention (71.1%). The mean number of inappropriate hospitalization days was 3.5 days for patients in group 1 and 1.9 days for those in group 2 (p = 0.013). The early identification of elderly inpatients at high risk of needing additional supportive social and health care would help patients to find the most appropriate resource according to their individuals needs.", "Integration of capillary microscopy and dermoscopy into the rheumatology fellow curriculum.\nThis study evaluates a novel, three-part nailfold capillaroscopy training curriculum for adult and paediatric rheumatology fellows. All rheumatology fellows training at an academic medical centre took part in the three-part nailfold capillaroscopy curriculum. Tests of fellows' usage, interest, confidence, and ability in nailfold capillaroscopy were taken at multiple time-points throughout the curriculum. Fellows self-reported high levels of interest, increased confidence in delineating normal and abnormal nailfold capillaries (p=0.03) and increased usage of nailfold capillaroscopy (p=0.09). The ability of fellows to identify normal nailfold capillaries (p=0.03) and systemic sclerosis-specific nailfold capillary changes, such as neoangiogenesis (p<0.001), also increased. The curriculum was feasible and led to improved ability of learners to distinguish normal from abnormal and to recognise and describe systemic sclerosis-specific nailfold capillary changes. This curriculum also led to improved confidence in examining nailfold capillaries and increased usage of this skill in rheumatologic consultation.", "Spatiotemporal distribution of neurovascular alignment in remodeling adult rat mesentery microvascular networks.\nAn emerging area of microvascular research focuses on the links between neural and vascular patterning. However, the functional dependence between vascular and neural growth in adult tissues remains underinvestigated. The objective of this study was to determine the spatial and temporal coordination between vascular and neural networks over a time course of adult microvascular growth. Mesentery tissues from adult male Wistar rats were harvested prior to stimulation, and 2, 10 and 30 days after angiogenesis stimulated by mast cell degranulation. Tissues were immunolabeled for PECAM (endothelial cell marker) and class III \u03b2-tubulin (peripheral nerve marker). Neurovascular alignment was quantified per vessel category: arterioles (>20 \u00b5m), pre-capillary arterioles (10-20 \u00b5m), post-capillary venules (10-20 \u00b5m), venules (>20 \u00b5m), capillaries (<10 \u00b5m) and capillary sprouts. Neurovascular alignment along pre-capillary arterioles, capillaries, post-capillary venules and venules was decreased compared to unstimulated levels on days 2 and 10. These decreases inversely correlated with increases in vessel density per vessel category. By day 30, alignment either returned to unstimulated levels or was increased compared to day 10. These results suggest that neurovascular alignment arises after microvascular network growth and is present along arterioles, venules and even capillaries.", "Prenatal antibiotic use and risk of childhood wheeze/asthma: A meta-analysis.\nExisting body of knowledge suggests that antibiotic use during pregnancy was inconsistently associated with childhood wheeze/asthma. The aim of this study was to determine whether exposure to antibiotic during pregnancy could increase the risk for childhood wheeze/asthma using a comprehensive meta-analysis. PubMed, MEDLINE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were systematically searched for studies up to September 10, 2014, and additional studies were found by searching reference lists of relevant articles. For this meta-analysis, cohort studies and case-control studies assessing the association between antibiotic use during pregnancy and risk of childhood wheeze/asthma were included. Extracted data were mainly pooled using random-effects model. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS). Ten studies were identified in final analysis. Pooling analysis of these studies showed an OR of 1.20 (95% CI, 1.13-1.27) for wheeze/asthma. After excluding case-control studies and prospective studies without achieving high scores on the NOS, the pooled OR was 1.18 (95% CI, 1.11-1.26). We found the risk of antibiotic use and pooled ORs of wheeze/asthma were 1.09 (95% CI, 0.92-1.29) for the first trimester, 1.14 (95% CI, 1.01-1.29) for the second trimester, and 1.33 (95% CI, 1.11-1.60) for the third trimester, respectively. This meta-analysis suggests that antibiotic exposure during pregnancy may increase the risk of wheeze/asthma in childhood. Besides, the risk of developing wheeze/asthma in childhood was marked during last two trimesters of pregnancy. Future studies of large-size and prospective cohorts which adequately address concerns for confounder bias are needed to examine the relationship between antibiotic use and risk of childhood asthma.", "Judging pain and disability: effects of pain severity and physician specialty.\nWhile considerable evidence indicates that the assessment of pain is an exercise in social cognition, provider contributions to pain assessment have received little attention. This study compared internist versus neurosurgeon ratings of pain and pain-related disability for hypothetical patients reporting either low or high levels of low back pain. Using practice characteristics as covariates, a multivariate analysis of covariance showed that both physician groups rated pain severity, but not measures of disability, as significantly lower for the low pain severity condition. Relative to internists, neurosurgeons rated both pain severity and pain-related disability as significantly lower, regardless of patient-reported pain severity. There were no interactions between physician specialty and patient-reported pain severity. Practice characteristics accounted for relatively little variance in ratings. Results are discussed in terms of differences in comparison levels for the physician groups, as well as implications for clinical practice and disability determination systems.", "Compliance of systematic reviews articles in brain arteriovenous malformation with PRISMA statement guidelines: Review of literature.\nThe knowledge of reporting compliance of systematic reviews with PRISMA guidelines may assist in improving the quality of secondary research in brain AVM management and subsequently application to patient population and clinical practice. This may allow researchers and clinicians to be equipped to appraise existing literatures based on known deficit to look for or expect. The objective of this study was to assess the compliance of systematic reviews and meta-analysis in the management of brain AVM. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses articles published in medical journals between 1st of May 2011 and 30th April 2016 (five-year period) were examined. Exclusion criteria were articles that were not systematic reviews and not meta-analyses, narrative literature reviews, historical literature reviews, animal studies, unpublished articles, commentaries and letter to the editor. Electronic database search performed through Medline PubMed on 20th September 2016. This systematic review examined seven systematic review articles on intracranial arteriovenous malformation compliance with PRISMA statement guidelines. The mean percentage of applicable PRISMA items across all studies was 74% (range 67-93%). Protocol registration and declaration, risk of bias and funding sources were the most poorly reported of the PRISMA items (14% each). A significant variance in the total percentages was evident between studies (67-93%). Systematic review reporting in medical literature is excessively variable and overall poor. As these papers are being published with increasing frequency, need to fully adhere to PRISMA statement guide for systematic review to ensure high-quality publications. Complete reporting of PRISMA items within systematic reviews in cerebral arteriovenous malformation enhance quality assessment, robust critical appraisal, better judgement and ultimately sound application to practice thereby improving research standards and patients care.", "Diffusion Mapping of Eosinophil-Activation State.\nEosinophils are granular leukocytes that play a role in mediating inflammatory responses linked to infection and allergic disease. Their activation during an immune response triggers spatial reorganization and eventual cargo release from intracellular granules. Understanding this process is important in diagnosing eosinophilic disorders and in assessing treatment efficacy; however, current protocols are limited to simply quantifying the number of eosinophils within a blood sample. Given that high optical absorption and scattering by the granular structure of these cells lead to marked image features, the physical changes that occur during activation should be trackable using image analysis. Here, we present a study in which imaging flow cytometry is used to quantify eosinophil activation state, based on the extraction of 85 distinct spatial features from dark-field images formed by light scattered orthogonally to the illuminating beam. We apply diffusion mapping, a time inference method that orders cells on a trajectory based on similar image features. Analysis of exogenous cell activation using eotaxin and endogenous activation in donor samples with elevated eosinophil counts shows that cell position along the diffusion-path line correlates with activation level (99% confidence level). Thus, the diffusion mapping provides an activation metric for each cell. Assessment of activated and control populations using both this spatial image-based, activation score and the integrated side-scatter intensity shows an improved Fisher discriminant ratio rd = 0.7 for the multivariate technique compared with an rd = 0.47 for the traditional whole-cell scatter metric. \u00a9 2019 The Authors. Cytometry Part A published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.", "Recent advances and future prospects of phyto-phospholipid complexation technique for improving pharmacokinetic profile of plant actives.\nThe phyto-phospholipid complexation technique has emerged as one of the leading methods of improving bioavailability of phytopharmaceuticals having poor competency of solubilizing and crossing the biological membranes. Several plant actives in spite having potent in vitro pharmacological activities have failed to demonstrate similar in vivo response. Such plant actives have been made more effective systemically by incorporating them with dietary phospholipids forming new cellular structures which are amphipathic in nature. In the last few years phospholipids have been extensively explored for improved bioavailability and efficacy of plant drugs. Further, it is also much relevant to mention that phospholipids show unique compatibility with biological membranes and have inherent hepatoprotective activity. Different methods have been adopted to formulate phospholipid complexes of plant extractives utilizing varying solvent systems, molar ratios of drug/phospholipids and different drying techniques. Some methods of formulating such drug-phospholipid complexes have been patented as well. However, the stability of phyto-phospholipid complexes is still a matter of concern which needs attention. But still a number of products exploiting this technique are under clinical trials and some of them are now in market. The current review highlights key findings of recent years with our own viewpoints which can give the new directions to this strategy and also includes advancements in the technical aspects of phyto-phospholipid formulations which have been done in the recent past with future challenges.", "Management of carotid artery stenosis: comparing endarterectomy and stenting.\nStroke ranks as the third leading cause of death, behind diseases of the heart and cancer. It is also the most important cause of disability. Approximately 750,000 people experience a stroke annually, costing an estimated $40 billion in direct and indirect costs. Approximately 25% of these ischemic events are related to occlusive disease of the cervical internal carotid artery. Carotid atherovascular stenosis increases the risk of ischemic stroke by acting as an embolic source, and causing hypoperfusion of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. With some limitations, the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET), European Carotid Surgery Trialists' Collaborative Group (ECST), and Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) have shown that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) substantially reduces the risk of stroke associated with certain grades of carotid stenosis. During the past few years, carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has evolved as an alternative to CEA, particularly in patients who are known to have a higher complication rate with CEA.", "Volatiles profiling in medicinal licorice roots using steam distillation and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to chemometrics.\nLicorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.) is a plant of considerable commercial importance in traditional medicine and for the flavor and sweets industry. Although Glycyrrhiza species are very competitive targets for phytochemical studies, very little is known about the volatiles composition within that genus, although such knowledge can be suspected to be relevant for understanding the olfactory and taste properties. To provide insight into Glycyrrhiza species aroma composition and for its use in food and pharmaceutical industry, volatile constituents from G. glabra, G. inflata, and G. echinata roots were profiled using steam distillation and solid-phase microextraction. Two phenols, thymol and carvacrol, were found exclusively in essential oil and headspace samples of G. glabra, and with highest amounts for samples that originated from Egypt. In G. echinata oil, (2E, 4E)-decadienal (21%) and \u03b2-caryophyllene oxide (24%) were found as main constituents, whereas 1\u03b1, 10\u03b1-epoxyamorpha-4-ene (13%) and \u03b2-dihydroionone (8%) predominated G. inflata. Principal component and hierarchical cluster analyses clearly separated G. echinata and G. inflata from G. glabra; with phenolics and aliphatic aldehydes contributing mostly for species segregation. Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) has large economic, nutritional, and medicinal values. The data presented in this article help in licorice quality control analysis to identify G. glabra from its closely allied species. The presence of thymol and carvacrol exclusively in G. glabra suggests that these volatiles could serve as chemotaxonomic markers and also might be considered as potentially relevant for taste.", "Low first-trimester hemoglobin and low birth weight, preterm birth and small for gestational age newborns.\nTo examine the relationship between first-trimester hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and risk of low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth and small for gestational age (SGA). Data were obtained from a population-based prenatal care program in China. A total of 88,149 women who delivered during 1995-2000 and had their Hb measured in the first trimester were selected as study subjects. The prevalence of anemia (Hb<110 g/L) was 22.1% in the first trimester. The risk of LBW, preterm birth and SGA was increased steadily with the decrease of first-trimester Hb concentration. After controlling for confounding factors, women with Hb 80-99 g/L had significantly higher risk for LBW (OR=1.44, 95% CI 1.17-1.78), preterm birth (OR=1.34, 95% CI 1.16-1.55) and SGA (OR=1.13, 95% CI 0.98-1.31) than women with Hb 100-119 g/L. No elevated risk was noted for women with Hb> or =120 g/L. Low first-trimester Hb concentration increases the risk of LBW, preterm birth and SGA.", "T+31C polymorphism of angiotensinogen gene and essential hypertension.\nA common variant at codon 235 of the angiotensinogen gene with methionine to threonine amino acid substitution (AGT M235T) has been reported as a genetic risk for essential hypertension. However, the frequency of AGT T235 was heterogeneous among races, and a positive association between AGT M235T and hypertension was not settled. To examine the association in a general population of Japanese (n=4013), we introduced the TaqMan polymerase chain reaction method and examined the relation between hypertension and T+31C polymorphism, which was in absolute linkage disequilibrium with AGT M235T. The C+31 allele of AGT was significantly associated with the positive family history of hypertension (FH) but not with the presence of hypertension or blood pressure. The subjects with CC tended to have hypertensive relatives, especially a hypertensive father or siblings, and its statistical significance was stronger in men. Adjustment of confounding factor did not alter the results of simple association study, suggesting that this positive association with FH is independent and significant. Our findings revealed that the TaqMan polymerase chain reaction method is a powerful tool for genetic association study with a large number of subjects and that AGT T+31C is significantly associated with paternal FH.", "Prophylaxis of implant-related staphylococcal infections using tobramycin-containing bone cement.\nIn a rabbit model, premixed tobramycin-containing bone cement was studied for its efficacy to prevent infections with two frequently encountered staphylococcal species in arthroplasty surgery. After intramedullary inoculation with staphylococci, either standard or premixed tobramycin-containing Simplex-P bone cement was injected in the right femur of 120 rabbits. Development of infection was examined by culture of femoral bone after 7 or 28 days. Loss of body weight and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the control rabbits inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus were seen in the first postoperative week, returning to normal in 28 days. Inoculation with Staphylococcus epidermidis resulted only in a low-grade infection. All rabbits receiving premixed tobramycin-containing bone cement were free of signs of infection, and all their cultures were negative. Culture yield from Staphylococcus aureus controls increased with time and inoculum dose. Staphylococcus epidermidis controls needed higher inoculum doses to establish an infection, while culture yield decreased in time. These differences in mode of prosthesis-related infection are explained by differences in virulence factors.", "Suicidal ideation and its correlates in prisoners: a comparative study in China.\nSuicide is one of the leading causes of prisoners' death, and, as a group, inmates have higher suicide rates than their community counterparts. However, the prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese inmates and their risks of suicide remain unknown. This study investigates the prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese incarcerated populations and its risk and protective factors. We randomly selected three types of prisoners (N = 690) and a sample of college students (n = 248) from four correction facilities and a police academy in China. A self-report questionnaire with standardized scales translated from the West was administered to the samples. The prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese inmates is similar to that found among inmates in the West. The correlates of suicidal ideation for the Chinese inmates are also in line with what has been found in general populations. It is suggested that Chinese inmates have the same risk factors and protective factors for suicidal ideation as the general population in China. Suicide prevention in Chinese prisons can learn from and inform suicide prevention work for the general population.", "Entire litters developed from transferred eggs in whole body X-irradiated female mice.\nThe sensitivity of mouse eggs to sublethal X-irradiation was determined in vitro and in vivo with regard to the development of donor litters in foster mothers. One thousand seven hundred fifty-eight unfertilized eggs of agouti dark-eyed donor mice were transferred into 293 unirradiated or X-irradiated, mated female pink-eyed mice. Two hundred thirty-nine recipients became pregnant; of these 35 produced litters containing solely dark-eyed fetuses. Sublethal doses of X-radiation administered to donor eggs in vitro before transferring into unirradiated recipients did not influence significantly the number of litters of exclusively dark-eyed fetuses produced. However, recipients irradiated by 250 roentgens (r) produced more solely dark-eyed litters than did those irradiated with 100 r. In 21 pregnant females irradiated by 100 r, only 3 (14%) developed solely dark-eyed fetuses as compared to 22 pregnant females irradiated by 250 r, of which 13 (59%) developed solely dark-eyed fetuses, all from unirradiated, transferred eggs. Of another group of 22 pregnant females which received 250 r body irradiation and subsequently received eggs also irradiated by 250 r, only 7 (32%) produced litters of dark-eyed fetuses. No one female of these three groups carried native fetuses. Such radiation-induced infertility resulting from damage of native eggs rather than loss of mother's ability to carry a pregnancy, is frequently remedied by egg transfer.", "The investigation of guided wave propagation around a pipe bend using an analytical modeling approach.\nGuided wave inspection has the advantage of providing full volumetric coverage of tens of meters of pipe from a single test location. However, guided wave behavior is complex and there are many factors to consider such as the numerous possible vibrational modes and multiple reflections. The guided wave inspection technique is potentially valuable for pipelines that cannot be inspected with internal \"pigs.\" However, in situations such as this, there are often bends in the pipe and the presence of the bend is known to distort the received signals. In order to address this issue, a study has been carried out that uses a combination of finite element analysis and experimentation to understand the behavior of guided waves in pipe bends. In addition to this, an analytical modeling methodology is put forward that uses basic information from finite element models of pipe bends to create a computationally fast solution to a potentially infinite number of scenarios. The analytical model can be used to both predict the effects of pipe bends on a range of signals and undo the distortion caused by pipe bends. Examples of this are given and compared to finite element results for flaws beyond pipe bends.", "Biliary elimination and pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine in micropigs.\nThe biliary elimination and pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine (NVB) were investigated in five conscious micropigs provided with a double-terminal choledocal fistula allowing the collection and reinstillation of bile. After the i.v. administration of NVB (0.5 mg/kg), serum and bile samples were collected over a 48-h period. The concentrations of NVB were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The serum concentrations decreased rapidly from a maximal value of 208.6 ng/ml (SD, 111.7 ng/ml). The mean half-life was 10.9 h (SD, 8.6 h) and the mean AUC0-48 h was 292.8 ng ml-1 h (SD, 79.4 ng ml-1 h). The bile concentrations were high, amounting to 16.0 micrograms/ml (range, 5.4-27.7 micrograms/ml). The 0- to 48-h biliary excretion of unchanged NVB accounted for 25.8% (SD, 5.7%) of the injected dose, with 21.5% (SD, 4.0%) being eliminated during the 0- to 8-h period. Desacetyl-NVB was found in an inconstant manner and in very low amounts in bile samples. In addition, no glucuronide of NVB could be detected. Thus, in the micropig, biliary excretion represents an important route of elimination for NVB.", "Scanning electron microscopical study of skeletal muscle fiber ends in normal and dystrophic mice.\nMuscle fiber ends at myotendinous junctions were examined by scanning electron microscopy after removal of tendon connective tissue components by HCl hydrolysis in the extensor digitorum longus muscle of 30-, 60- and 120-day-old normal and dystrophic (dy) mice. A remarkable morphological difference between normal and dystrophic mice was observed. In normal 30-day-old mice, muscle fiber ends had already assumed a complicated three-dimensional morphology with many thin cytoplasmic processes and lateral longitudinal clefts. On the other hand, in dystrophic animals at the 60th day, muscle fiber ends were characterized by a simple conical form with a rather smooth surface in which existed a number of pit-like sarcolemmal invaginations, and short and narrow longitudinal slits, possibly an indication of developmental immaturity. Thereafter, the slits increased in number and in length, although the linear elongation of the slits seems to be caused by the fusion of adjacent pits to one another and to existing slits. From these findings, the fiber ends in the adult (120-day-old) dystrophic mouse are suggested to retain a preceding state of their unique structural differentiation.", "Aedes koreicus-a new member of the genus Aedes establishing in Germany?\nAedes koreicus, a mosquito species originating from Japan, China, Korea, and parts of Russia, has been sporadically found in Europe since 2008. It is suspected to be a vector of a variety of viruses and nematodes. In Germany, one individual was found in 2015 in the city of Augsburg, situated in the federal state of Bavaria. Based on morphological and molecular species identification, this study reports a new finding of Ae. koreicus, about 370 km northwest from Augsburg. The sampling point is located in the city of Wiesbaden, in the federal state of Hesse, where four individuals were found over a period of 2 months in 2017. The re-finding of the species in the same location in May and July 2018 suggests that (a) the species was able to reproduce and overwinter at this site, and (b) spreading of non-native mosquito species is an ongoing process in Germany, which requires close monitoring.", "[Role of serum pepsinogen I values in primary duodenal ulcer in childhood].\nSerum pepsinogen I (PGI) was measured by radioimmunoassay in the fasting state in three homogeneous family groups composed of parents and their children. Group 1, families, did not suffer from primary duodenal ulcer (PDU). Group 2, 10 families had at least one parent with PDU diagnosed endoscopically. Group 3, 6 families, had at least one child with PDU and one parent with PDU diagnosed endoscopically. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of PGI in the examined children, showed a significant difference between the three groups (F = 22.83; p = 0.005). In all 3 groups the ANOVA of serum PGI of the fathers and the mothers were significantly different: fathers (F = 4.4; p = 0.241); mothers (F = 3.4; p = 0.05). A correlation was noted between PGI of the fathers and PGI of the children (r = 0.31; p = 0.05); but a more significant correlation was observed between PGI of the mothers and PGI of the children (r = 0.48; p = 0.001). In group 3, the correlation between PGI of the mothers and PGI of the children was striking (r = 0.89; p = 0.025). However, the PGI of the fathers and the PGI of the children were not different in this group (r = 0.27; p = n.s.). The multiple correlation between PGI of the children and PGI of both parents was significant (r2 = 0.316). In group 3, the correlation was very high between the mothers and the children (r2 = 0.81).", "Fat-free mass as a function of maximal oxygen consumption and 24-hour urinary creatinine, and 3-methylhistidine excretion.\nThe relationships between maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) with fat-free mass (FFM), and with 24-h urinary excretion of 3-methylhistidine (3MH) and creatinine (Cr), were studied in 12 active men age 31.4 +/- 9 yr (mean +/- SD). FFM, VO2max and VO2maxWt-1 were 50.9 +/- 9.1 kg, 3.8 +/- 0.9 L X min-1, and 54.8 +/- 9.4 ml X kg-1 X min-1, respectively. Urinary 3MH and Cr after 3 days on a meat-free diet were 213.9 +/- 30.8 mumol X day-1 and 1.60 +/- 0.3 g X day-1, respectively. 3MH X Cr-1 was 135.3 +/- 16.8 mumol X g-1 or 15.3 +/- 1.9 molar ratio X 10(3). The strongest (p less than 0.01) associations found were 3MH versus FFM, FFM versus VO2max, and 3MH versus VO2max. Other significant (p less than 0.05) relationships were Cr versus FFM, Cr versus 3MH, and Cr versus VO2max. Nonsignificant correlations were found for 3MH X Cr-1 versus VO2max X kg-1 X min-1 versus FFM, 3MH X Cr-1 versus VO2max, and FFM versus VO2max X kg-1 X min-1. The best predictor of FFM was 3MH. It was concluded that endogenous urinary 3MH excretion is a valid method to study human body composition and that 3MH is more closely related to FFM (r = 0.93) than VO2max (r = 0.78).", "Dose-response relationship between gamma-glutamyltransferase and the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases in Korean adults.\nThe value of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) in the putative mechanisms underlying its association with cardiovascular disease is unclear. This study examined whether serum GGT value has an independent association and dose-response relationship with the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). This observational study included 419,433 subjects from the National Health Insurance Service database. Serum GGT levels were classified into sex-specific quartiles. We used Cox proportional hazard models to examine the effect of serum GGT values on the risk of ASCVD. We quantified associations of the serum GGT quartile groups with risk of ASCVD or each subtype through multivariate sub-distribution hazard models adjusted for covariates at baseline. During 4,572,993.8 person-years of follow-up for ASCVD, we documented 40,359 (9.6%) incident cases of ASCVD. The highest serum GGT group had a significant association with ASCVD in contrast to the lowest serum GGT quartile group (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19-1.27). Serum GGT quartile groups 2, 3, and 4 had a significantly higher risk for incident hemorrhagic stroke than the serum GGT quartile group 1 (Q 2: HR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.83-1.02; Q 3: HR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.93-1.15; Q 4: HR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.16-1.42; p for trend <0.001). For ischemic heart disease (IHD) and myocardial infarction, non-linear trends were shown according to increasing log-transformed GGT values. In the dose-response trends to assess the interaction effect of obese status, differences of trends were shown between serum GGT level and IHD or hemorrhagic stroke. The serum GGT value, which is known as a factor linked to cardiovascular diseases, has a strong independent association and dose-response relationship with hemorrhagic stroke risk in contrast to that with ischemic stroke or IHD.", "Quantitative shear wave magnetic resonance elastography: comparison to a dynamic shear material test.\nMagnetic resonance elastography (MRE), a phase contrast MRI technique, images the propagation of applied mechanical waves in tissue, allowing shear stiffness to be quantified in vivo. This MRE technique has been validated with static mechanical compression tests. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) may be a more appropriate comparison to MRE because it directly measures the shear modulus dynamically, while compression tests convert the measured elastic modulus to shear modulus with an assumed Poisson ratio. This study compared the shear stiffness estimated with various MRE inversion algorithms (i.e., manual calculation, local frequency estimate, phase gradient, direct inversion, and matched filter) to the dynamic mechanical test. The shear stiffness of five agarose gels with concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 3.5% were measured using MRE and DMA. The phase gradient inversion algorithm overestimated the shear modulus at higher concentrations (i.e., 3-3.5% agar), while the results from the other techniques correlated well with the dynamic mechanical test.", "Binding sites for 1,4-dihydropyridine Ca(2+)-channel modulators in rat intestinal smooth muscle.\nThe contractile response of intestinal smooth muscle to depolarization is characterized by a phasic and a tonic component which are differently sensitive to blockade by 1,4-dihydropyridines. As this difference in sensitivity could be related to different binding sites associated with distinct calcium channels, we analyzed the binding of the calciumantagonist 1,4-dihydropyridine (+)PN 200-110 [isopropyl-4-(2,1,3-benzodiazol-4-yl)-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5- methoxycarbonyl-pyridine-3-carboxylate] in longitudinal smooth muscle of the rat ileum. We carried out saturation binding experiments on intact tissue exposed to physiological and depolarizing (100 mmol l-1 K+) solution, and on different membrane fractions: the total microsomal fraction, the light microsomal fraction (enriched with plasma membranes) and the mitochondrial fraction. Binding of 3H(+)PN 200-110 to the intact longitudinal smooth muscle of rat ileum appeared to be voltage-dependent, KD decreased in depolarized tissue whereas Bmax was unchanged (change in membrane potential was assessed by measuring the distribution of 3H-tetraphenylphosphonium bromide). In membrane fractions two binding sites were detected, a high-affinity site associated with plasma membrane and a low-affinity site presumably associated with mitochondria (abundant in the fractions where the cytochrome c oxidase activity was high, and undetectable in the light microsomes poor in cytochrome c oxidase activity). The KD value of the high-affinity binding in isolated membrane fractions was similar to the KD value measured in intact depolarized tissue. The low affinity binding increased at high ionic strength and did not display any stereoselectivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "Natural and experimental infection of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) in benthic larvae of mud crab Scylla serrata.\nWhite spot syndrome virus (WSSV), the causative agent of white spot syndrome in shrimp, has a wide host range which extends to crabs, copepods and other arthropods. In this study, benthic larvae of the mud crab Scylla serrata were captured from Taiwan's coastal waters and screened for the presence of WSSV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization. WSSV was detected in around 60% of the larvae, and this prevalence rate remained fairly constant when the captured larvae were subsequently maintained in an aerated system in the laboratory. WSSV-free larvae obtained from a hatchery were challenged by immersion in a WSSV inoculum. Fifteen days after challenge, cumulative mortality in the experimental group reached 43% compared to 20% in the control group. PCR detection of WSSV in both moribund and surviving specimens clearly implicated the virus as the cause of death in most cases. Histological and in situ hybridization data confirmed that WSSV tissue tropism in Scylla serrata crab larvae is similar to that found in shrimp.", "Response of dairy cows to sodium bicarbonate and limestone in early lactation.\nA total of 108 dairy cows at three locations were fed a diet supplemented with sodium bicarbonate and limestone during the first 16 wk of lactation. Complete mixed diets were fed for ad libitum intake and consisted of concentrate and corn silage (60:40, dry matter). The four treatments were: 1) basal diet, 2) basal plus 1.2% sodium bicarbonate, 3) basal plus 1.4% limestone, and 4) basal plus 1.2% sodium bicarbonate plus 1.4% limestone. Dry matter intake was increased for 8 wk by sodium bicarbonate, then decreased from wk 9 to 16. Intake was decreased by limestone alone or in combination with sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate increased milk production for 8 wk and 4% fat-corrected milk for 16 wk. Average dry matter intake, milk production, and 4% fat-corrected milk (kg/day) for the 16 wk were: 1) 20.2, 31.1, 27.3; 2) 19.8, 32.0, 28.7; 3) 18.9, 31.4, 27.9, and 4) 18.4, 29.7, 27.2 for diets 1 to 4. Ruminal pH was decreased, and volatile fatty acid concentration was increased by added sodium bicarbonate and appeared to result from increased feed intake. Digestibility of nutrients was unaffected by supplements. Sodium bicarbonate affected regulation of blood and urine pH and concentration of electrolytes more than limestone. Serum magnesium was reduced with sodium bicarbonate, although not beyond normal physiological reference range.", "Bright artificial light at night is associated with increased body mass, poor reproductive success and compromised disease tolerance in Australian budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus).\nArtificial light at night (ALAN) can cause circadian disruption and result in adverse behavioral and ecological effects in free-living birds, but studies on captive pet birds as companion animals have been infrequent. We studied the effects of exposure to bright ALAN on body mass, melatonin sulfate levels, reproduction and disease severity in Australian budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) kept in captivity. During the experiment, birds were kept under outdoor temperature, humidity and natural photoperiod from September to December. A total of 48 birds were equally split into 4 groups (6 mating pairs each) and concurrently exposed to ALAN of 200 lux with different duration (0, 30, 60 and 90 min). Monthly observations were recorded for all dependent parameters. ALAN exposure increased mass gain and suppressed melatonin levels in a dose-dependent manner, especially during December. In addition, ALAN exposure in all duration groups decreased egg production and reduced hatchability from 61% \u00b1 14% in the ALAN-unexposed control group to 0% in the ALAN-exposed birds. Disease severity was also found to increase in line with the duration of ALAN exposure. In captive M. undulatus, ALAN exposure was demonstrated to affect photoperiodic regulation with subsequent excess mass gain and reproduction impairment, and increased susceptibility to infections plausibly through duration dose-dependent suppression of melatonin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a possible association between acute bright ALAN of increasing duration and both natural development of infections as well as reproductive cessation in captive birds. Our findings could be used to improve breeding conditions of captive birds.", "Validity and reliability of instruments aimed at measuring Evidence-Based Practice in Physical Therapy: a systematic review of the literature.\nOur goal is to compile and analyse the characteristics - especially validity and reliability - of all the existing international tools that have been used to measure evidence-based clinical practice in physiotherapy. A systematic review conducted with data from exclusively quantitative-type studies synthesized in narrative format. An in-depth search of the literature was conducted in two phases: initial, structured, electronic search of databases and also journals with summarized evidence; followed by a residual-directed search in the bibliographical references of the main articles found in the primary search procedure. The studies included were assigned to members of the research team who acted as peer reviewers. Relevant information was extracted from each of the selected articles using a template that included the general characteristics of the instrument as well as an analysis of the quality of the validation processes carried out, by following the criteria of Terwee. Twenty-four instruments were found to comply with the review screening criteria; however, in all cases, they were found to be limited as regards the 'constructs' included. Besides, they can all be seen to be lacking as regards comprehensiveness associated to the validation process of the psychometric tests used. It seems that what constitutes a rigorously developed assessment instrument for EBP in physical therapy continues to be a challenge.", "Hypokalemia induces renal injury and alterations in vasoactive mediators that favor salt sensitivity.\nWe investigated the hypothesis that hypokalemia might induce renal injury via a mechanism that involves subtle renal injury and alterations in local vasoactive mediators that would favor sodium retention. To test this hypothesis, we conducted studies in rats with diet-induced K+ deficiency. We also determined whether rats with hypokalemic nephropathy show salt sensitivity. Twelve weeks of hypokalemia resulted in a decrease in creatinine clearance, tubulointerstitial injury with macrophage infiltration, interstitial collagen type III deposition, and an increase in osteopontin expression (a tubular marker of injury). The renal injury was greatest in the outer medulla with radiation into the cortex, suggestive of an ischemic etiology. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found an increased uptake of a hypoxia marker, pimonidazole, in the cortex. The intrarenal injury was associated with increased cortical angiontensin-converting enzyme (ACE) expression and continued cortical angiotensin II generation despite systemic suppression of the renin-angiotensin system, an increase in renal endothelin-1, a decrease in renal kallikrein, and a decrease in urinary nitrite/nitrates and prostaglandin E(2) excretion. At 12 wk, hypokalemic rats were placed on a normal-K+ diet with either high (4%)- or low (0.01%)-NaCl content. Despite correction of hypokalemia and normalization of renal function, previously hypokalemic rats showed an elevated blood pressure in response to a high-salt diet compared with normokalemic controls. Hypokalemia is associated with alterations in vasoactive mediators that favor intrarenal vasoconstriction and an ischemic pattern of renal injury. These alterations may predispose the animals to salt-sensitive hypertension that manifests despite normalization of the serum K+.", "Evidence for octopaminergic modulation of an insect visceral muscle.\nTwo dorsal unpaired median neurons (DUMOV1 and DUMOV2) lying in the posterior region of the VIIth abdominal ganglion of Locusta migratoria have axons which project to the muscles of the oviducts. This study reports the presence of octopamine within isolated DUMOV cell bodies, as well as in the oviducal nerve and innervated oviducal muscle. Individual cell bodies were pooled and found to contain about 0.34 pmol of octopamine per cell body giving an approximate value of 1.27 mM octopamine. Octopamine is concentrated within the area of oviducal muscle which receives DUMOV axons. Pharmacological studies reveal that the amplitude of neurally-evoked contractions of the oviducal muscle is reduced in a dose-dependent manner by octopamine, with threshold lying between 5 X 10(-10) M and 7 X 10(-9) M. The receptors for this response show a specificity for octopamine and synephrine, with an order of potency being octopamine = synephrine greater than metanephrine greater than tyramine greater than dopamine. The presence of octopamine throughout this neural pathway, coupled with the demonstration of octopaminergic modulation of muscular contraction, supports the hypothesis that octopamine serves a physiological role in this visceral system.", "Inhibition effects of quinones on aldose reductase: Antidiabetic properties.\nDiabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by abnormal glucose metabolism. Aldose reductase (AR) is the first enzyme in the polyol pathway and converts glucose to sorbitol. It plays a vital role as a glucose reducing agent and is involved in the pathophysiology of diabetic complications. In this study, we purified AR from sheep kidney with a specific activity of 2.00 EU/mg protein and 133.33- fold purification After the purification of the AR enzyme, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed and the molecular weight of the enzyme was found approximately as 38 kDa. The inhibition effects of eight quinones were studied against AR. The quinones were potent inhibitors of AR with Ki values in the range of 0.07-20.04 \u03bcM. Anthraquinone showed the best potential inhibitory effects against AR. All compounds exhibited noncompetitive inhibition against AR. These compounds may be selective inhibitors of this enzyme. AR inhibition is an essential strategy for the attenuation and prevention of diabetic complications.", "Mortality among workers at a uranium processing facility, the Linde Air Products Company Ceramics Plant, 1943-1949.\nA retrospective cohort mortality study of 995 white males employed more than 30 d at a uranium processing facility in upstate New York between 1943 and 1949 investigated the association between excess observed deaths and long-term occupational exposure via inhalation to uranium compounds. Two comparison groups were used, the white male population of the United States and the white male population in the New York counties of Erie and Niagara. The vital status determination was 94.3% complete through 31 December 1979. With the use of the national comparison group, statistically significantly increased standardized mortality ratio (SMR) values were observed for all causes (SMR 118), laryngeal cancer (SMR 447), all circulatory diseases (SMR 118), arteriosclerotic heart disease (SMR 119), all respiratory diseases (SMR 152), and pneumonia (SMR 217). Site-specific outcomes of special interest with a statistically increased number of deaths above expected were laryngeal cancer (observed 5) and pneumonia (observed 17). No association was found with length of employment or work in the most hazardous areas of the plant. The comparison with regional rates gave similar results.", "Clinical and molecular aspects of 30 patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD): unusual features and response to treatment.\nPompe disease is a rare metabolic disorder, due to mutations in the gene encoding acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), of which infantile and late-onset forms may occur. Aim of the work was to analyze clinical and laboratory data of a cohort of late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) patients, collected during the last 15 years and to point out unusual phenotypic/genotypic features as well as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) responses. We diagnosed 30 LOPD patients; at follow-up, they underwent motor, respiratory, cardiac and muscle MRI evaluations. Motor performances were tested by Walton Gardner-Medwin, GSGC and 6MWT tests. Respiratory function was assessed as FVC% in upright/supine position. LOPD presentations were represented by presymptomatic hyperCKemia (37%), proximal/axial muscle weakness (53%) and respiratory impairment (10%). Median diagnostic delay was 8.6 years (\u00b1 8.8). Atypical features were observed in 4 patients: marked distal muscle weakness and severe hearing loss at onset, as well as leukoencephalopathy and mesial temporal sclerosis during the disease course. By GAA sequence analysis, two causing mutations were detected in 22/30 patients, only one in the remaining 8 subjects. Overall, 29/30 patients harbored the common c.-32-13T>G mutation (2 were homozygous). Two new DNA variations were discovered (c.2395C>G, c.1771C>T). 14 patients received ERT for up to 60 months. Our study confirms LOPD clinical and genetic heterogeneity: atypical features may contribute to expand the clinical phenotype highlighting its multi-systemic nature. A timely diagnosis could allow early ERT start. An accurate follow-up is recommended to evaluate treatment responses.", "The MIQE guidelines: minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments.\nCurrently, a lack of consensus exists on how best to perform and interpret quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) experiments. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in many publications, which impedes a reader's ability to evaluate critically the quality of the results presented or to repeat the experiments. The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. MIQE is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating qPCR experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. MIQE details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement. Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of qPCR results.", "The effect of postharvest ripening on strawberry bioactive composition and antioxidant potential.\nThe aim of the present work was to evaluate the phytochemical profile and the antioxidant activity of strawberry fruit (cv. Camarosa) upon postharvest ripening at room temperature (20 \u00b0C) and to correlate them with qualitative attributes. 'Camarosa' fruit retained an appreciable postharvest performance for up to 1 day shelf life; thereafter substantial quality deterioration was observed. An increased phenolic content, mainly attributed to hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonols and anthocyanins, was monitored after 3 days maintenance at 20 \u00b0C. The chromatographic fingerprint of athocyanins showed that pelargonidin-3-glucoside was the major anthocyanin, which increased with the increase of shelf life period, while cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside were found at lower concentrations. The potent radical scavenging activity, evaluated with four in vitro assays, showed a higher antioxidant capacity after 3 and 1 days of shelf life. In addition, the antioxidant effect of strawberry fruit extracts on lipid substrates and on an emulsion system showed a significant inhibition in the formation of conjugated diene hyperoxides. Interestingly, no direct correlation between the phytochemical profile and the quality attributes exist. 'Camarosa' fruit had acceptable quality attributes for fresh consumption and at the same time a high phytochemical content up to 1 day shelf life. The over-ripe fruit continued to be an excellent reservoir of natural antioxidants, pointing to its potential use as food antioxidant and nutritional supplement.", "Protein kinase C regulates macrophage tumor necrosis factor secretion: direct protein kinase C activation restores tumor necrosis factor production in endotoxin tolerance.\nMacrophages pretreated in vitro with endotoxin (LPSp) secrete less tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in response to a second LPS activating (LPSa) stimulus. Protein kinase C (PKC) is required for TNF secretion in a macrophage stimulated with LPSa. In these experiments we examined the role of PKC in TNF signal transduction in naive and tolerant macrophages. Murine macrophages were cultured +/- LPSp for 24 hours. Cultures were washed and treated for 1 hour with PKC inhibitors or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a direct PKC activator. Cells were then stimulated with a range of LPSa for 6 hours, and TNF was determined by bioassay. LPSa-stimulated TNF secretion by nontolerant macrophages was inhibited by LPSp in the absence of PMA. PKC inhibitors decreased TNF by naive macrophages and exaggerated inhibition in tolerant cells. Depletion of PKC by 24 hours of PMA decreased TNF production by both naive and tolerant macrophages. PKC activation with PMA 1 hour before LPSa augmented TNF secretion in naive cells and reversed TNF inhibition of tolerant cells. Direct PKC activation with PMA restored TNF secretion in LPS-tolerant macrophages. Endotoxin tolerance may alter the LPSa signal transduction pathway between the LPS receptor and PKC activation.", "Decisional involvement: staff nurse and nurse manager perceptions.\nEnhancing involvement in organizational decisions is one strategy to improve the work environment of registered nurses and to increase their recruitment and retention. Little is known about the type of decision making and the level of involvement nurses desire. This was a descriptive study exploring staff nurse and nurse manager ratings of actual and preferred decisional involvement and differences between staff nurses and nurse managers. A sample of 320 RNs from a Midwestern health care network was surveyed using the Decisional Involvement Scale. Nurse managers and staff nurses had statistically significant differences in their perceptions of who was involved in actual decision making in the areas of unit governance and leadership and collaboration or liaison activities. There were statistically significant differences in preferred decisional involvement between staff nurses and nurse managers in the overall DIS scale and the subscales of unit governance and leadership and quality of support staff practice.", "Prevention and control of tetanus in childhood.\nUntil recently, tetanus was estimated to be killing well over half a million children each year in the developing world, most commonly through neonatal tetanus, the incidence of which was around six per 1000 live births. Neonatal tetanus most commonly occurs through cord contamination of the umbilical stump. Vaccination of pregnant women and infants is an effective and inexpensive intervention that results in major health gains, although educating traditional birth attendants and mothers about safer birthing practices probably also lowers the incidence of tetanus. Recently, however, new vigor and strategies in immunization programs have resulted in substantial improvements. Immunization of pregnant women, and identification and targeting of areas and populations in which neonatal tetanus is occurring are especially effective. Tetanus will continue to be a pediatric problem until vaccination strategies are effectively implemented, surveillance systems are improved, and hygienic birthing practices become standard in all countries.", "Topological Modeling for Vector Graphics.\nVector graphics refers to the use of geometrical primitives, such as B\u00e9zier curves, to represent digital images. It is becoming increasingly popular among graphic designers who need to deliver resolution-independent content that looks sharp across all types of desktop and mobile devices, or need to support user interactivity and animation. Unfortunately, most vector graphics tools today have many limitations, such as the inability to represent shapes sharing a common edge. In my doctoral dissertation, we address this issue by developing a novel data structure, called the vector graphics complex, which supports fundamental topological modeling operations for vector graphics illustrations. We also extend this data structure to animation, allowing features of a connected drawing to merge, split, appear, or disappear at desired times via keyframes that introduce the desired topological change. The resulting space-time continuous complex directly captures the time-varying topological structure, and allows features to be readily edited in both space and time in a way that reflects the intent of the drawing.", "Persistent factor VIII-dependent factor X activation on endothelial cells is independent of von Willebrand factor.\nEndothelial cells are able to support the activation of coagulation factor X by activated factor IX in the presence of its cofactor, factor VIII. We have previously reported that this reaction is persistent on endothelial cells, but transient on activated platelets and phospholipid vesicles when activated factor X (Xa) is used as activator of factor VIII. Aim of the present study was to explore the influence of von Willebrand factor and that of the factor VIII activator, either factor Xa or thrombin, on the decay of factor X activation on the endothelial cell surface. Kinetics of factor X activation on human umbilical vein endothelial cells was compared with that on phospholipid vesicles employing purified coagulation factors from plasma as well as recombinant factor VIII variants. Employing factor Xa as factor VIII activator, rate constants for decay of membrane-bound factor X activation were consistently low on endothelial cells (0.02 min) as compared with phospholipid vesicles (0.2 min). Activation of factor VIII by thrombin resulted in two-fold increased decay rates. In the presence of excess of von Willebrand factor over factor VIII, decay rates were not significantly changed. Factor VIII variants with and without a Tyr to Phe substitution, which abolishes high-affinity binding to von Willebrand factor, displayed the same factor X activation decay kinetics. Although previous studies have shown that von Willebrand factor modulates factor VIII activation and stabilisation, this apparently does not affect the progression of factor X activation at the endothelium.", "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting in decoding the SARS-CoV genome.\nProgrammed ribosomal frameshifting is an essential mechanism used for the expression of orf1b in coronaviruses. Comparative analysis of the frameshift region reveals a universal shift site U_UUA_AAC, followed by a predicted downstream RNA structure in the form of either a pseudoknot or kissing stem loops. Frameshifting in SARS-CoV has been characterized in cultured mammalian cells using a dual luciferase reporter system and mass spectrometry. Mutagenic analysis of the SARS-CoV shift site and mass spectrometry of an affinity tagged frameshift product confirmed tandem tRNA slippage on the sequence U_UUA_AAC. Analysis of the downstream pseudoknot stimulator of frameshifting in SARS-CoV shows that a proposed RNA secondary structure in loop II and two unpaired nucleotides at the stem I-stem II junction in SARS-CoV are important for frameshift stimulation. These results demonstrate key sequences required for efficient frameshifting, and the utility of mass spectrometry to study ribosomal frameshifting.", "Biocarriers Improve Bioaugmentation Efficiency of a Rapid Sand Filter for the Treatment of 2,6-Dichlorobenzamide-Contaminated Drinking Water.\nAminobacter sp. MSH1 immobilized in an alginate matrix in porous stones was tested in a pilot system as an alternative inoculation strategy to the use of free suspended cells for biological removal of micropollutant concentrations of 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM) in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). BAM removal rates and MSH1 cell numbers were recorded during operation and assessed with specific BAM degradation rates obtained in lab conditions using either freshly grown cells or starved cells to explain reactor performance. Both reactors inoculated with either suspended or immobilized cells showed immediate BAM removal under the threshold of 0.1 \u03bcg/L, but the duration of sufficient BAM removal was 2-fold (44 days) longer for immobilized cells. The longer sufficient BAM removal in case of immobilized cells compared to suspended cells was mainly explained by a lower initial loss of MSH1 cells at operational start due to volume replacement and shear. Overall loss of activity in the reactors though was due to starvation, and final removal rates did not differ between reactors inoculated with immobilized and suspended cells. Management of assimilable organic carbon, in addition to cell immobilization, appears crucial for guaranteeing long-term BAM degradation activity of MSH1 in DWTP units.", "Diagnostic utility of sialosyl-Tn in discriminating carcinomatous cells from benign mesothelium in body cavity effusions.\nDetecting malignant cells in the setting of reactive mesothelium can be difficult. Several techniques have been tried but without widespread acceptance. Sialosyl-Tn (STn) is an aberrantly glycosylated precursor of the MN blood group antigen frequently expressed in carcinomas and dysplastic epithelium. We investigated the STn monoclonal antibody for its clinical utility as an isolated stain to discriminate benign mesothelium from malignant cells. Cell block material from 72 cases of body cavity fluids were immunostained for STn using the avidin-biotin complex method without antigen retrieval. Slides were incubated overnight at 4 degrees C in a humidified chamber. Strong immunoreactivity was noted in 31/40 (77%) carcinomatous cases. Only moderate staining was noted in 1 of 28 (4%) benign effusions and weak staining in 5 (18%) additional benign cases. Specificity was 100%, sensitivity 78%, positive predictive value 100% and negative predictive value 76%. No staining was noted in four noncarcinomatous malignant effusions. STn may have diagnostic value in this cytologic setting as part of a diagnostic panel but not as an isolated stain.", "Possible participation of intracellular platelet-activating factor in NF-kappaB activation in rat peritoneal macrophages.\nAs we had found previously that thapsigargin, an endomembrane Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, induces production of intracellular platelet-activating factor (PAF) [Br. J. Pharmacol. 116 (1995) 2141], we decided to investigate the possible roles of intracellular PAF in nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation of thapsigargin-stimulated rat peritoneal macrophages. When rat peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with thapsigargin, the level of inhibitory protein of NF-kappaB-alpha (IkappaB-alpha) was decreased and the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB was increased. The thapsigargin-induced activation of NF-kappaB was inhibited by the PAF synthesis inhibitor SK&F 98625 and the PAF antagonist E6123. Structurally unrelated PAF antagonists such as E5880 and L-652,731 also inhibited the thapsigargin-induced activation of NF-kappaB. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of NF-kappaB was also suppressed by these drugs. In a culture of rat peritoneal macrophages, exogenously added PAF did not induce degradation of IkappaB-alpha. These findings suggest that the intracellular PAF produced by the stimulation with thapsigargin or LPS is involved in activation of the NF-kappaB pathway.", "Effects of antiallergic drugs on the proliferation of estrogen-sensitive mouse Leydig cell line.\nThe proliferation of B-1F cells established from an estrogen-sensitive mouse Leydig cell tumor is negatively regulated by leukotrienes, whose production is suppressed by the addition of estrogen. Disodium cromoglycate, tranilast, repirinast, tazanolast and pemirolast potassium are used as therapeutic agents for allergic diseases. They are known to inhibit the release of chemical mediators such as histamine and leukotrienes from peripheral leukocytes. It is therefore of interest to determine whether these drugs affect the proliferation of B-1 F cells. The drugs in the culture medium stimulated the proliferation of B-1F cells to various extents. The results suggest that chronic administration of these drugs to the patients with allergic diseases may possibly enhance the proliferation of some kinds of tumor cells, resulting in the change from latent to clinical tumors, although there are significant differences between in vitro cultured animal cells and in vivo humans.", "Actinic keratosis, or solar keratosis, are scaly, crusty growths (lesions) caused by damage from the sun's ultraviolet rays. They typically appear on sun-exposed areas such as the face, bald scalp, lips, and the back of the hands, and are often elevated, rough in texture, and resemble warts. Most become red, but some will be tan, pink, and/or flesh-toned. If left untreated, up to ten percent of actinic keratosis develop into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the second most common form of skin cancer. In rarer instances, actinic keratosis may also turn into basal cell carcinomas, the most common form of skin cancer. It is estimated that more than 58 million Americans suffers from actinic keratosis. The treatments for actinic keratosis include cryotherapy, surgical removal, chemical peel, photodynamic therapy, laser resurfacing, and/or drug-containing gel and creams. Due to the prevalence of actinic keratosis, and its ability to turn into skin cancer if not treated properly, development of further treatments is warranted.", "Expression and significance of DDX43 in lung adenocarcinoma.\nThis paper aims to determine the expression and clinical significance of DDX43 in lung adenocarcinoma. Expression of DDX43 gene and protein of lung adenocarcinoma tissue and para-carcinoma tissues was observed in 27 cases by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. These patients were diagnosed as lung adenocarcinoma in the Huaihe Hospital of Henan University from February 2015 to December 2015. The relative ratio of DDX43 mRNA expression in lung adenocarcinoma and para-carcinoma tissues was 0.87\u00b10.62 versus 0.21\u00b10.77 and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P<0.01). The expression of DDX43 in normal lung tissues and lung adenocarcinoma tissues was different. The positive rate of DDX43 expression in lung adenocarcinoma tissues was significantly higher than that in normal lung tissues, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The analysis of clinical pathological characteristics showed that the increase of protein expression was related to the stage and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma. DDX43 is highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma, and the expression level is related to the stage and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting that DDX43 is closely related to the occurrence and development of lung adenocarcinoma, and may be a molecular marker for early diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma.", "Heat shock response inhibits IL-18 expression through the JNK pathway in murine peritoneal macrophages.\nHeat shock response has been implicated in cytoprotective effects from cellular damage and in the regulation of cytokine expression. We report the effect of heat shock on LPS-induced expression of IL-18, an important cytokine that has diverse immune regulatory effects on T cells, B cells, NK cells, and nonimmune cells. The augmentation of LPS-induced IL-18 mRNA and protein was significantly suppressed in murine peritoneal macrophages after 43 degrees C heat shock treatment. In addition, the JNK MAPK inhibitor SP600125 inhibited IL-18 mRNA transcription in a dose-dependent manner. To examine the possibility that the inhibition of IL-18 may be mediated through the inactivation of JNK, the activity of JNK was measured by using Western blot and kinase assays. Our data show that heat shock response decreased LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK and its downstream substrate c-Jun. AP-1, a transcriptional factor composed of c-Jun, could regulate the expression of IL-18. Also, its DNA-binding activity was reduced by the heat shock response. These findings suggest that treatment of heat stress results in inhibition of IL-18 production in macrophages mainly through the JNK/AP-1 signaling pathway.", "Induced MiR-1249 expression by aberrant activation of Hedegehog signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.\nAberrant activations of Hedegehog (Hh) signaling were found in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and some other cancer types. However, the details have not been completely understood and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we reported that miR-1249 transcription in HCC cells was regulated through direct binding to the conserved sequences in miR-1249 promoter region by Gli1, which functions as a transcription factor and is a component in the Hh signaling pathway. Interestingly, expression of tumor suppressor PTCH1, which is another component of the Hh signaling pathway, was inhibited by miR-1249 through targeting its 3'-untranslated region. Down-regulation of PTCH1 further enhanced the downstream effects mediated by Gli1. In consistent with these findings, miR-1249 expression level was correlated with degree of prognosis (p=0.005) in HCC patients. Taken together, our results suggested the existence of a positive feedback loop comprised of Gli1, miR-1249 and PTCH1. During the process of HCC progression, this positive feedback loop could be continuously activated to enhance tumor cell growth, migration and invasion.", "Diffusive nature of thermal transport in stanene.\nUsing the phonon Boltzmann transport formalism and density functional theory based calculations, we show that stanene has a low thermal conductivity. For a sample size of 1 \u00d7 1 \u03bcm(2) (L \u00d7 W), the lattice thermal conductivities along the zigzag and armchair directions are 10.83 W m(-1) K(-1) and 9.2 W m(-1) K(-1) respectively, at room temperature, indicating anisotropy in thermal transport. The low values of thermal conductivity are due to large anharmonicity in the crystal resulting in high Gr\u00fcneisen parameters, and low group velocities. The room temperature effective phonon mean free path is found to be around 17 nm indicating that the thermal transport in stanene is completely diffusive in nature. Furthermore, our study reveals the relative importance of the contributing phonon branches and that, at very low temperatures, the contribution to lattice thermal conductivity comes from the flexural acoustic (ZA) branch and at higher temperatures it is dominated by the longitudinal acoustic (LA) branch. We also show that the lattice thermal conductivity of stanene can further be reduced by tuning the sample size and creating rough surfaces at the edges. Such tunability of lattice thermal conductivity in stanene suggests its applications in thermoelectric devices.", "The contents of this book, about the impact on the values of young people which textbooks and other books designed for them from preschool through twelfth grade have by the way they depict black people in the United States, include the following articles: (1) \"Storytellers and gatekeepers,\" J.

(JM)", "Cell volume regulates liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase genes.\nHypertonic-induced cell shrinkage increases glucose release in H-4-II-E rat hepatoma cells. This is paralleled by a concomitant increase in the mRNA levels of the rate-limiting enzymes of the pathway of gluconeogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP), of seven- and fivefold, respectively. In contrast, hypotonic-induced swelling of the cells results in a transient decrease in PCK and FBP mRNAs to 15% and 39% of control levels. The antagonistic effects of hyper- and hypotonicity mimic the counteracting effects of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and insulin on PCK and FBP mRNA levels. The hypertonic-induced increase in mRNA levels is due to an enhanced transcriptional rate, whereas the decrease in mRNAs caused by hypotonicity results from a decrease in transcription as well as mRNA stability. The inductive effect of hypertonicity does not require ongoing protein synthesis and acts independently of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C pathways. These results suggest that cell volume changes in liver cells may play an important role in regulating hepatic glucose metabolism by altered gene expression.", "Helium-3 MRI diffusion coefficient: correlation to morphometry in a model of mild emphysema.\nHyperpolarised gases have been most recently used in magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate new image-derived pulmonary function parameters. One of these parameters is the apparent diffusion coefficient, which reflects the sizes of the structures that compartmentalise gas within the lung (i.e. alveolar space). In the present study, noninvasive parameters were compared to microscopic measurements (mean linear intercept and mean alveolar internal area). Nonselective helium-3 gas density coronal ex vivo images and apparent diffusion maps were acquired in control and elastase-induced panacinar emphysema rats. Total lung capacity was considered the reference for both imaging experiments and lung fixation. A mild degree of emphysema was found based on mean linear intercept (134 +/- 25 microm) versus control (85 +/- 14 microm). The apparent diffusion coefficients were significantly different between the two groups (0.18 +/- 0.02 and 0.15 +/- 0.01 cm2 x s(-1) for elastase and control, respectively). A significant correlation between the apparent diffusion coefficient and corresponding morphometric parameters in mild emphysema was demonstrated for the first time. This study opens the possibility of estimating absolute airspace size using noninvasive techniques.", "Assessment of pancreatic CT enhancement using a high concentration of contrast material.\nTo evaluate the usefulness of pancreatic enhancement using a high concentration of contrast material in CT. We performed abdominal CT on 125 patients after dividing them at random into five groups with two different concentrations, two different injection rates and three different injection doses: group A: 100 ml, 300 mgI/mL, 3 mL/sec; group B: 2 mL/kg, 300 mgI/mL, 3 mL/sec; group C: 1.5 mL/kg, 370 mgI/mL, 3 mL/sec; group D: 2 mL/kg, 300 mgI/mL, 5 mL/ sec; and group E: 1.5 mL/kg, 370 mgI/mL, 5 mL/sec. Among these five groups, the two groups given a concentration of 370 mgI/mL received a dose of 1.5 mL/body weight. The peak enhancement value of the pancreas was significantly greater in group E than in groups A and B. However, no statistically significant differences were found among the other groups. The fast injection rate using the high concentration of contrast medium provided greater enhancement of the pancreas than the slow injection rate using the routine concentration of contrast medium, and pancreatic CT enhancement depended more on the dose of iodine per second than on that of total iodine.", "Virtual Guidance of Percutaneous Transthoracic Needle Biopsy with C-Arm Cone-Beam CT: Diagnostic Accuracy, Risk Factors and Effective Radiation Dose.\nC-arm cone-beam computed tomography-guided transthoracic lung core needle biopsy (CBCT-CNB) is a safe and accurate procedure for the evaluation of patients with pulmonary nodules. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance, complication rates and effective radiation dose of CBCT-CNB with virtual guidance. We retrospectively collected data regarding 375 CBCT-CNBs performed with virtual guidance (XperGuide-Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) from January 2010 to June 2015 on 355 patients (mean age, 68.1 years \u00b1 11.8; age range, 31-88 years). Patients were divided into groups and compared based on the diagnostic failure and lesion size (15 mm cutoff). Diagnostic performance, complication rate and effective radiation dose were investigated. Variables influencing diagnostic performance and complications were assessed using Student's T test and Pearson's \u03c72 test. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and accuracy for patients subjected to CNBs were 96.8%, 100%, 100%, 100% and 97.2%, respectively. Considering risk factors for pneumothorax, no significant differences were found regarding patient and lesion characteristics. Perilesional hemorrhage occurred more frequently in older patients (p = 0.046) and in smaller lesions (p = 0.001). Hemoptysis was significantly more frequent in patients with perilesional hemorrhage (p = 0.01). Mean effective radiation dose in CBCT-CNB was 7.12 \u00b1 8.78 mSv. CBCT-CNB combined with virtual guidance is a reliable and accurate technique that allows exact localization of pulmonary lesions, effective preprocedural planning and real-time fluoroscopy altogether.", "Correct Hox gene expression established independently of position in Caenorhabditis elegans.\nThe Hox genes are expressed in a conserved sequence of spatial domains along the anteroposterior (A/P) body axes of many organisms. In Drosophila, position-specific signals located along the A/P axis establish the pattern of Hox gene expression. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, it is not known how the pattern of Hox gene expression is established. C. elegans uses lineal control mechanisms and local cell interactions to specify early blastomere identities. However, many cells expressing the same Hox gene are unrelated by lineage, suggesting that, as in Drosophila, domains of Hox gene expression may be defined by cell-extrinsic A/P positional signals. To test this, we have investigated whether posterior mesodermal and ectodermal cells will express their normal posterior Hox gene when they are mispositioned in the anterior. Surprisingly, we find that correct Hox gene expression does not depend on cell position, but is highly correlated with cell lineage. Thus, although the most striking feature of Hox gene expression is its positional specificity, in C. elegans the pattern is achieved, at least in part, by a lineage-specific control system that operates without regard to A/P position.", "Evidence - The intraoral palpability of the lateral pterygoid muscle - A prospective study.\nThe intraoral palpability of the inferior caput of the lateral pterygoid muscle has been a matter of ambiguity because of its topography. Thus, none of the recently published studies has provided reliable proof of the possibility of digital intraoral palpation, although palpation of the muscle is part of most of the examination catalogs for clinical functional analysis and functional therapy. Digital muscle palpation was performed intraorally on five preparations after exposure of the infratemporal fossa and visualization of the lateral pterygoid muscle. Direct digital palpation of the lateral pterygoid muscle was seen in all five cases. The successful palpation was carried out and approved during laterotrusion to the examined side (relaxation). While opening and closing the mouth (contraction) the muscle is palpable. In real-time kinematic measurements (MRI) an impression of the lateral caput of the left lateral pterygoid muscle of a 30-year-old control male person was found up to 6mm. Electromyographic detection by direct signal conduction with concomitant palpation is possible. The injection electrode tested in situ in the muscle was felt transorally with the palpating finger. The intraoral palpability of the inferior caput of the lateral pterygoid muscle is verified. The basic requirement for successfully palpating the lateral pterygoid muscle is the exact knowledge of muscle topography and the intraoral palpation pathway. After documented palpation of the muscle belly in cadaverous preparations, MRI and EMG also visualized palpation of the lateral pterygoid muscle in vivo. The palpation technique seems to be essential and basically feasible.", "[A study on reservoir function of Kock pouch during a 3-year postoperative period].\nKock continent ileal reservoir has been one of the major options of urinary diversion for the patients with bladder cancer. We performed Kock pouch operation in 16 patients (male 12, female 4; from 41 to 66 years old, mean age 57 years old). Since the reservoir function of Kock pouch after a long postoperative period is not well known, we examined the volume capacity, the compliance and the length of efferent valve of Kock pouch in 8 patients during a 3-year postoperative period. Although the compliance was stable, the volume capacity and the length of the efferent valve showed a decreasing tendency. The shorter efferent valve was not always associated with the case of urinary incontinence. Most of the complications in 15 patients was trouble of efferent valve (prolapse of efferent valve in 7 cases and eversion or fistula formation that required reconstruction surgery in 3 cases). Although some complications were observed, the reservoir function of the pouch was stable. Therefore this method is reliable for permanent urinary diversion.", "Modulation of rabbit neutrophil chemotaxis by cytochalasin A. A comparison with other neutrophil functions.\nChemotaxis and stimulated locomotion by rabbit peritoneal neutrophils are inhibited by cytochalasin A; inhibition is complete with 5 X 10(-7) M cytochalasin A. Under the same conditions exocytosis and activation of the metabolic burst are stimulated maximally with 5 X 10(-7) M cytochalasin A. Inhibition of these function occurs at concentrations higher than 10(-6) M, inhibition being complete with 5 X 10(-6) M cytochalasin A. The sulfhydryl compound glutathione can prevent the inhibitory effect of cytochalasin A on chemotaxis. Inactivation of the sulfhydryl groups on the outer surface of the plasma membrane does not affect the inhibitory effect of cytochalasin A. It is concluded that the cellular target of cytochalasin A has a different significance for chemotaxis as compared with exocytosis and metabolic burst. The possibility that cytochalasin A reacts with sulfhydryl groups, located on a structure closely connected with the inner surface of the plasma membrane, is discussed.", "Atmospheric hydroxyl radical (OH) abundances from ground-based ultraviolet solar spectra: an improved retrieval method.\nThe Fourier Transform Ultraviolet Spectrometer (FTUVS) instrument has recorded a long-term data record of the atmospheric column abundance of the hydroxyl radical (OH) using the technique of high resolution solar absorption spectroscopy. We report new efforts in improving the precision of the OH measurements in order to better model the diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variability of odd hydrogen (HO(x)) chemistry in the stratosphere, which, in turn, will improve our understanding of ozone chemistry and its long-term changes. Until the present, the retrieval method has used a single strong OH absorption line P(1)(1) in the near-ultraviolet at 32,341 cm(-1). We describe a new method that uses an average based on spectral fits to multiple lines weighted by line strength and fitting precision. We have also made a number of improvements in the ability to fit a model to the spectral feature, which substantially reduces the scatter in the measurements of OH abundances.", "Identification of subcellular energy fluxes by P NMR spectroscopy in the perfused heart: contractility induced modifications of energy transfer pathways.\nThe identification of subcellular fluxes of exchange of ATP, phosphocreatine (PCr) and Pi between mitochondria, cytosol and ATPases and pathways of energy transfer in a whole organ is a challenge specially in the myocardium where 50% of creatine kinases (CK) are found in close vicinity of ATP producing (mito-CK) and utilizing (MM-bound CK) reactions. To dissect their contribution in cardiac energy transfer we recently developed a new experimental 31P NMR spectroscopy approach. This led to identify three kinetically different subcellular CKs and to evidence experimentally the CK shuttle in a rat heart perfused in isovolumy. Here we show that a decreased energy demand alters energetic pathways : two CKs (cytosolic and MM-bound) functioning at equilibrium and a non mitochondrial ATP<-->Pi exchange was sufficient to describe NMR data. Mito-CK fluxes was not detected anymore. This confirms the dependence of energy pathways upon cardiac activity. Indeed the subcellular localization and activity of CKs may have important bioenergetic consequences for the in vivo control of respiration at high work: free ADP estimated from global CK equilibrium might not always adequately reflect its concentration at the ANT.", "Klinefelter syndrome in clinical practice.\nKlinefelter syndrome is the most common sex-chromosome disorder; it affects approximately one in every 660 men. This syndrome is characterized by the presence of one or more extra X chromosomes, and the karyotype 47,XXY is the most prevalent type. The 'prototypic' man with Klinefelter syndrome has traditionally been described as tall, with narrow shoulders, broad hips, sparse body hair, gynecomastia, small testicles, androgen deficiency, azoospermia and decreased verbal intelligence. A less distinct phenotype has, however, been described. Klinefelter syndrome is an underdiagnosed condition; only 25% of the expected number of patients are diagnosed, and of these only a minority are diagnosed before puberty. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome should be treated with lifelong testosterone supplementation that begins at puberty, to secure proper masculine development of sexual characteristics, muscle bulk and bone structure, and to prevent the long-term deleterious consequences of hypogonadism; however, the optimal testosterone regimen for patients with Klinefelter syndrome remains to be established.", "[Cytology in the positive diagnosis and grading of prostatic cancers: which indications do remain at the time of automatic biopsies and endorectal echography?].\nThe diagnostic sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the prostate can be evaluated by comparing its results to a histological reference: rates of reported Se range from 65-98%, Sp being equal or superior to 95%. Published series are heterogeneous in terms of cancer prevalence, with a 25-85% proportion of histologically proven adenocarcinomas, irrespective of the anatomical stage of the disease. The overall accuracy of screening by core biopsies or FNAC is lower than 5%, and does not justify wide-scale application of these tests. In 75%, cytological assessment of the tumor grade correlates with Gleason's histological score and grade. Severe intraductal dysplasias (DIC 3) are probably involved in some of the cytological grade I cases. Ultrasonographic guidance of FNAC is not recommended in comparison with histologically obtained data. The indications for performing FNAC of the prostate should be different from those of standard biopsies: the former should be carried out on suspicious lesions revealed by digital rectal examination or ultrasonography, or in a staging attempt. FNAC should be reserved for early diagnosis of prostate cancer in patients presenting with non-specific urologic symptoms. Samples should be obtained by digitally-guided transrectal bilateral FNAC.", "Laccase-catalyzed oxidation of iodide and formation of organically bound iodine in soils.\nLaccase oxidizes iodide to molecular iodine or hypoiodous acid, both of which are easily incorporated into natural soil organic matter. In this study, iodide sorption and laccase activity in 2 types of Japanese soil were determined under various experimental conditions to evaluate possible involvement of this enzyme in the sorption of iodide. Batch sorption experiment using radioactive iodide tracer ((125)I(-)) revealed that the sorption was significantly inhibited by autoclaving (121 \u00b0C, 40 min), heat treatment (80 and 100 \u00b0C, 10 min), \u03b3-irradiation (30 kGy), N(2) gas flushing, and addition of reducing agents and general laccase inhibitors (KCN and NaN(3)). Interestingly, very similar tendency of inhibition was observed in soil laccase activity, which was determined using 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) as a substrate. The partition coefficient (K(d): mL g(-1)) for iodide and specific activity of laccase in soils (Unit g(-1)) showed significant positive correlation in both soil samples. Addition of a bacterial laccase with an iodide-oxidizing activity to the soils strongly enhanced the sorption of iodide. Furthermore, the enzyme addition partially restored iodide sorption capacity of the autoclaved soil samples. These results suggest that microbial laccase is involved in iodide sorption on soils through the oxidation of iodide.", "Towards living well with young onset dementia: An exploration of coping from the perspective of those diagnosed.\nThere is increasing recognition that dementia in people under 65 years represents a unique challenge to sufferers and services alike. However, by either ignoring this population or sampling them together with older adults, current research has failed to reflect this. This study explored the specific experience of living and coping with Alzheimer's disease in younger life from the perspective of those diagnosed. Semi-structured interviews were analysed using interpretive phenomenological analysis, and four themes were identified: 'disruption of the life-cycle', 'identity', 'social orientation' and 'agency'. The experience of living and coping with young onset Alzheimer's disease was strongly situated within an individual's social context. Most significantly, participants felt too young to develop the disease and felt out of time with age-related psychological tasks. Coping strategies that attempted to redress and normalise the life-cycle were identified. The contributions of the study are discussed in the context of the human development literature.", "Recognition and management of childhood cardiac arrhythmias.\nCardiac arrhythmias are common in children, but most of them are benign and do not signify underlying heart disease. However, the main tachyarrhythmias (SVT and VT) can cause cardiovascular collapse, and should therefore be treated promptly. Drug treatment is generally effective and is appropriate in stable patients. DC shock is the treatment of choice in patients with compromised circulation. There is a wide array of antiarrhythmic drugs and though they are generally safe, most of them have the potential for serious adverse effects. Hence, there is a need to exercise caution and balanced judgement in prescribing them. It is perhaps best for the general duty paediatric staff to be familiar with a select few, and stick to them if possible. Management of most cases of cardiac arrhythmia in children is within the competence of non-cardiologist paediatric staff. But in some instances cardiology referral will be required, either for further investigations, for decision regarding longterm drug therapy, or for more technical management modalities.", "Insights into mechanisms of central nervous system myelination using zebrafish.\nMyelin is the multi-layered membrane that surrounds most axons and is produced by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). In addition to its important role in enabling rapid nerve conduction, it has become clear in recent years that myelin plays additional vital roles in CNS function. Myelinating oligodendrocytes provide metabolic support to axons and active myelination is even involved in regulating forms of learning and memory formation. However, there are still large gaps in our understanding of how myelination by oligodendrocytes is regulated. The small tropical zebrafish has become an increasingly popular model organism to investigate many aspects of nervous system formation, function, and regeneration. This is mainly due to two approaches for which the zebrafish is an ideally suited vertebrate model--(1) in vivo live cell imaging using vital dyes and genetically encoded reporters, and (2) gene and target discovery using unbiased screens. This review summarizes how the use of zebrafish has helped understand mechanisms of oligodendrocyte behavior and myelination in vivo and discusses the potential use of zebrafish to shed light on important future questions relating to myelination in the context of CNS development, function and repair.", "Longitudinal study of macular folds by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography.\nTo understand the natural history of macular folds using serial spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Prospective case series. Serial OCTs were performed using Topcon 3D OCT. The main outcome measures were: patient demographics; preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative details; serial SD-OCTs; and length of follow-up. Ten patients who underwent standard 3-port pars plana vitrectomy with gas tamponade to repair rhegmatogenous retinal detachment were included in this study. Mean follow-up was 9.9 months (range 5-17 months). Three types of retinal folds were identified: 1) ripple; 2) taco; 3) displacement. Ripple and taco folds were found to resolve spontaneously. Outer retinal hyperreflective lesions resolved first, followed by flattening of the inner retinal layers. Displacement folds also resolved, but left the macula translocated inferiorly, causing binocular diplopia. Ripple and taco folds could be managed conservatively with good outcomes. However, the optimal treatment of displacement folds requires further research.", "The prone position eliminates compression of the lungs by the heart.\nThe prone position improves gas exchange in many patients with ARDS. Animal studies have indicated that turning prone restores ventilation to dorsal lung regions without markedly compromising ventral regions. To investigate a potential mechanism by which this might occur, the relative volume of lung located directly under the heart was measured in the supine and prone positions in seven patients. Four axial tomographic sections between the carina and the diaphragm were analyzed (Sections 1 through 4). When supine, the percent of the total lung volume located under the heart increased from 7 +/- 4% to 42 +/- 8%, and from 11 +/- 4% to 16 +/- 4% in Sections 1 through 4, in the left and right lungs, respectively. When prone, the percent of left and right lung volume located under the heart was </= 1 and </= 4 %, respectively, in all four sections (p < 0.05 for each section, supine versus prone). Although a large fraction of the lung, particularly on the left, is located directly under the heart in supine patients, and would be subject to the compressive force resulting from heart weight, almost no lung is located under the heart when patients are prone and the compressive force of the heart is directed towards the sternum.", "Investigating hairy cell leukemia dysregulations. Looking for interferon alpha site of action in hairy cells.\nOne of the most striking characteristics of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is its remarkable responsiveness to alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) therapy. IFN-alpha is a multifunctional cytokine able to regulate the growth, differentiation and recirculation of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. These activities have been extensively studied in hairy cells, but none of these properties has been shown to fully account for IFN-alpha responsiveness. Numerous data now support the idea that IFN-alpha exerts its therapeutic effect both indirectly, through stimulation of immunocompetent cells, and directly on the hairy cells. Our approach to investigate the mode action of IFN-alpha in HCL has been to identify abnormalities which occur in these tumor cells and then to ascertain whether these abnormalities can be rectified by IFN-alpha treatment. A high level of free Ca2+ in the cytoplasm of hairy cells was identified. Increases in cytosolic Ca2+ are believed to be a pivotal signal in regulating cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell death. These high Ca2+ levels in hairy cells could be reduced upon treatment with IFN-alpha either in vitro or in vivo, probably acting by reducing Ca2+ influx into the leukemic cells. Moreover, the effect of IFN-alpha on [Ca2+]i seems to be correlated with alteration in the pattern of kinase/phosphatase activities and with down-regulation of CD20 phosphorylation, a B cell specific phosphoprotein involved in Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane.", "Day surgery and hospital efficiency: empirical analysis of Norwegian hospitals, 1999-2001.\nDay surgery has gained increasing significance in Norwegian health care during the 1990s, and now constitutes more than 50% of all elective surgery. Although the underlying general assumption is that this mode of delivering surgery will increase the efficiency of hospitals, most former studies have focused only on the cost-efficiency for specific types of surgical operations. The present study therefore uses data from Norwegian hospitals to test whether the proposition that day surgery spells efficiency also holds true at the hospital level. Hospital efficiency is measured as the technical efficiency of hospitals. This indicator captures how efficient hospitals are in utilising their total resources, and builds on a variety of hospital inputs (inpatient care, outpatient care) and hospital outputs (physician full-time equivalents (FTEs), other labour equivalents, medical expenses). Our empirical analysis is based on a simple decision model where the hospitals maximise utility functions of income, patients and effort under the constraint of the budget and various structural characteristics. The empirical model thus controls for several other important determinants of efficiency, such as hospital budget, the outpatient revenue share, irregularly long length of stay, hospital type and the share of emergency admissions. After accounting for these variables, our results document significant effects of day surgery on technical efficiency. The results furthermore show that the positive effect of day surgery is contingent upon hospital budget, as hospitals with large budgets experience stronger efficiency effects of day surgery.", "Effect of parathyroid hormone on arachidonic acid metabolism in mouse osteoblasts: permissive action of dexamethasone.\nWe examined the regulation of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism in primary cultures of mouse osteoblasts under steady state and after acute stimulation by PTH. Both dexamethasone-treated and untreated cells were evaluated, as glucocorticoids are known to modulate some actions of PTH in osteoblasts and to affect arachidonic acid metabolism in cells in general. Cells were labeled with [3H]AA for 3 h, followed by a 20-h equilibrium period, then exposed to 10(-8) M PTH for different time periods ranging from 2-60 min. The results showed that although osteoblasts maintained in vitro in the absence of dexamethasone were responsive to PTH, as measured by cAMP production (50-fold increase), PTH had no effect on the distribution of AA in phospholipids and did not induce the release of free AA from phospholipid pools. After 7-day treatment of the cells with 4 x 10(-7) M dexamethasone, 15-min PTH stimulation resulted in a significant increase in free AA within the cells (mean +/- SE, +142 +/- 11%; n = 9) and a short-lived change in the distribution of AA within cellular phospholipids (phosphatidylethanolamine, -63 +/- 3%; phosphatidylinositol, +168 +/- 7%; phosphatidylserine, +296 +/- 50%; sphingomyelin, +220 +/- 20%; lysophosphatidylcholine, +634 +/- 31%; mean +/- SE; n = 3), despite the fact that no changes in PTH-induced cAMP production were observed. Because the release of free AA is an essential step in the production of eicosanoid metabolites that could act as second messengers, these findings suggest that corticosteroid treatment may activate signal transduction pathways for PTH which are latent in untreated cells, and thereby explain at least in part the profound effects of corticosteroids on osteoblast function.", "Finite element analysis of mechanical behavior of human dysplastic hip joints: a systematic review.\nDevelopmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a common condition predisposing to osteoarthritis (OA). Especially since DDH is best identified and treated in infancy before bones ossify, there is surprisingly a near-complete absence of literature examining mechanical behavior of infant dysplastic hips. We sought to identify current practice in finite element modeling (FEM) of DDH, to inform future modeling of infant dysplastic hips. We performed multi-database systematic review using PRISMA criteria. Abstracts (n = 126) fulfilling inclusion criteria were screened for methodological quality, and results were analyzed and summarized for eligible articles (n = 12). The majority of the studies modeled human adult dysplastic hips. Two studies focused on etiology of DDH through simulating mechanobiological growth of prenatal hips; we found no FEM-based studies in infants or children. Finite element models used either patient-specific geometry or idealized average geometry. Diversities in choice of material properties, boundary conditions, and loading scenarios were found in the finite-element models. FEM of adult dysplastic hips demonstrated generally smaller cartilage contact area in dysplastic hips than in normal joints. Contact pressure (CP) may be higher or lower in dysplastic hips depending on joint geometry and mechanical contribution of labrum (Lb). FEM of mechanobiological growth of prenatal hip joints revealed evidence for effects of the joint mechanical environment on formation of coxa valga, asymmetrically shallow acetabulum and malformed femoral head associated with DDH. Future modeling informed by the results of this review may yield valuable insights into optimal treatment of DDH, and into how and why OA develops early in DDH.", "Ganglion cell complex scan in the early prediction of glaucoma.\nTo compare the macular ganglion cell complex (GCC) with peripapillary retinal fiber layer (RNFL) thickness map in glaucoma suspects and patients. Forty participants (20 glaucoma suspects and 20 glaucoma patients) were enrolled. Macular GCC and RNFL thickness maps were performed in both eyes of each participant in the same visit. The sensitivity and specificity of a color code less than 5% (red or yellow) for glaucoma diagnosis were calculated. Standard Automated Perimetry was performed with the Octopus 3.1.1 Dynamic 24-2 program. The statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS 10.1 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, EUA). Results were expressed as mean +/- standard deviation and a p value of 0.05 or less was considered significant. Provide absolute numbers of these findings with their units of measurement. There was a statistically significant difference in average RNFL thickness (p=0.004), superior RNFL thickness (p=0.006), inferior RNFL thickness (p=0.0005) and average GCC (p=0.03) between the suspects and glaucoma patients. There was no difference in optic disc area (p=0.35) and vertical cup/disc ratio (p=0.234) in both groups. While 38% eyes had an abnormal GCC and 13% had an abnormal RNFL thickness in the glaucoma suspect group, 98% had an abnormal GCC and 90% had an abnormal RNFL thickness in the glaucoma group. The ability to diagnose glaucoma with macular GCC thickness is comparable to that with peripapillary RNFL thickness . Macular GCC thickness measurements may be a good alternative or a complementary measurement to RNFL thickness assessment in the clinical evaluation of glaucoma.", "Soft tissue contusion repairing effects of Hong Yao with different penetration enhancers.\nHong Yao aerosol (HYA) is a new dosage form developed from Hong Yao, a traditional Chinese medicine preparation, which has the efficacy of promoting soft tissue contusion repair, anti-inflammation, and analgesia. To evaluate the soft tissue contusion repairing, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of HYA formulations with different penetration enhancers (PE) and to quantify the transdermal absorption of HYA component. Three preparations of HYA with different PEs were made: DMSO preparation (5% DMSO as additional PE), Azone preparation (3% azone as additional PE), and NAPE preparation (no additional PE). Four in vivo rodent models were employed to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of the HYAs: mouse soft tissue contusion model, rat paw edema model, mouse ear swelling model, and mouse analgesia model of electric-stimulated foot. In vitro skin penetration experiment was applied to evaluate the transdermal absorption of HYA components. All HYA preparations showed effects on soft tissue contusion repairing, anti-inflammation, and analgesia compared with the blank control (p<0.05). There was no significant difference among the three preparations. Pathological variation of mice skin and the pain response time (PRT) reduction phenomena indicated that DMSO preparation induced skin irritation. In vitro skin penetration experiment showed no significant difference between DMSO and NAPE on absorption enhancement of ferulic acid from HYA. NAPE preparation was considered as best and Menthol/borneol (6.3%, W/W, 4:1.75) in HYA might be a good PE combination.", "Prefilming twin-fluid nozzle assisted precipitation method for preparing nanocrystalline HNS and its characterization.\nThe ultra-fine HNS (2,2',4,4',6,6'-hexanitrostilbene) with desired properties is needed for military and civilian applications because of its reliable threshold energy to short impulse shock waves and its excellent thermal and shock stability. This paper reports on prefilming twin-fluid nozzle assisted precipitation (PTFN-P) to obtain ultra-fine HNS explosive with high specific surface area (SSA), high purity, and narrow particle size distribution. The properties of ultra-fine HNS have been confirmed by SEM, BET, HPLC, XRD, DSC and TGA-SDTA. SEM photograph revealed that the PTFN-P process offers ellipsoid crystalline morphology with particle size of 90-150 nm. The BET and Langmuir SSA of nanocrystalline HNS with purity of 99.44 wt.% were determined to be 19.28 m(2)/g and 29.26 m(2)/g, respectively. The XRD peaks of nanocrystalline HNS seemed to have similar diffraction angles as those of synthesized HNS, and the weakening of peak strength was observed apparently. DSC results of the nanocrystalline HNS showed that the exothermic decomposing at the temperature range of 323-398 degrees C. Furthermore, HNS samples were submitted to impact and small scale gap test and the results indicated that nanocrystalline HNS is less sensitive than synthesized HNS (50 microm) to impact and shock stimuli.", "Grasping the concept of personal property.\nThe concept of property is integral to personal and societal development, yet understanding of the cognitive basis of ownership is limited. Objects are the most basic form of property, so our physical interactions with owned objects may elucidate nuanced aspects of ownership. We gave participants a coffee mug to decorate, use and keep. The experimenter also designed a mug of her own. In Experiment 1, participants performed natural lifting actions with each mug. Participants lifted the Experimenter's mug with greater care, and moved it slightly more towards the Experimenter, while they lifted their own mug more forcefully and drew it closer to their own body. In Experiment 2, participants responded to stimuli presented on the mug handles in a computer-based stimulus-response compatibility task. Overall, participants were faster to respond in trials in which the handles were facing in the same direction as the response location compared to when the handles were facing away. The compatibility effect was abolished, however, for the Experimenter's mug--as if the action system is blind to the potential for action towards another person's property. These findings demonstrate that knowledge of the ownership status of objects influences visuomotor processing in subtle and revealing ways.", "A role of microRNA-370 in hepatic ischaemia-reperfusion injury by targeting transforming growth factor-\u03b2 receptor II.\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small non-coding RNAs with modulator activity of gene expression. The role of miRNAs in hepatic ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is currently largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of miR-370 in hepatic IR injury. The expression levels of hepatic miR-370 in male C57BL/6 mice subjected to hepatic IR injury or ischaemia preconditioning were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. The effect of miR-370 on hepatic IR injury was investigated by serum enzyme analysis and histological examination of liver following treatment of mice with antagomir-370 or control. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines and apoptosis- and proliferation-related genes were also determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore, the potential targets of miR-370 in this injury were studied by bioinformatics analysis, luciferase assays, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. The results showed that miR-370 expression was significantly upregulated in the mice subjected to hepatic IR injury as compared with the sham-operated mice. Inhibition of miR-370 led to the downregulation of serum aminotransferase and proinflammatory cytokines, as well as the improvement of hepatic histological damage. Reporter assays confirmed that miR-370 directly targeted the 3' untranslated region of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 receptor II (T\u03b2RII). Inhibition of miR-370 was sufficient to reinstate the expression of T\u03b2RII and its downstream target phosphorylated Smad3. Our data suggest that miR-370 acting via T\u03b2RII might play a potential role in hepatic IR injury, and inhibition of miR-370 efficiently attenuated the damage to the liver.", "Effects of isotonic saline solution resuscitation on blood coagulation in uncontrolled hemorrhage.\nIt has been suggested that fluid resuscitation before surgical control of hemorrhage may lead to increased bleeding because of the elevated blood pressures and clotting factor dilution. This study was designed to assess the effects of isotonic saline solution resuscitation on blood coagulation during uncontrolled hemorrhage. Twenty-four female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups with different resuscitation regimens: group A, no resuscitation; group B, 40 ml/kg in 4 minutes; group C, 80 ml/kg in 4 minutes; and group D, 80 ml/kg in 1 minute. Baseline blood samples were collected just before a sharp resection of 75% of the tail to initiate the hemorrhage; 15 minutes later the resuscitation began. Additional blood samples were obtained at 60 minutes after resection. The blood was analyzed for platelets, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time. The largest differences between time 0 and 60 minutes were observed in group D with platelets decreasing 43.36% +/- 7.86%, fibrinogen decreasing 57.10% +/- 16.88%, and prothrombin time increasing from an average 16.5 to 19.2 seconds. These differences was statistiacally significant (p <0.05) with the Student's test. The results suggested that even though the volume of resuscitation fluid did not appear to affect clotting time when compared with that of nonresuscitated animals, the rate of extremely large volume infusions may play an important role in the cessation of bleeding and consequently in the management of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock.", "Giardia gene predicts a 183 kDa nucleotide-binding head-stalk protein.\nPreviously described extended proteins from the cytoskeleton of Giardia lamblia (beta-giardin, median body protein) have been found to be segmented coiled coils with regular structural repeat patterns in their amino acid sequences. Screening a lambda ZAPII library derived from Giardia genomic DNA with an antibody directed against a 34 x 10(3) M(r) giardin isoform selected a gene encoding a much larger polypeptide chain (HPSR2), the sequence of which was determined by chromosome walking the open reading frame. The complete gene has been cloned and expressed as a recombinant protein of 183 x 10(3) M(r). The predicted amino acid sequence of the protein has identifiable features suggesting that it might be a motor protein with an amino-terminal hydrolytic domain attached to a long coiled coil stalk. The presumed head domain is 211 residues and contains a P-loop sequence conserved in purine nucleotide-binding proteins. The remaining 1409 amino acids mainly make up a region of heptad repeats such as in myosin or the kinesin stalk, ending in a small (67 amino acids) carboxy-terminal domain. Fourier analysis of the predicted stalk shows the presence of a strong physical repeat created by regular heptad phase changes dividing the coil into segments of 25 residues. This structure most closely resembles the smaller microtubule-associated median body protein which has segments of 24 residues.", "The strategies for treating primary hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus.\nTo further improve the effectiveness and prognosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), the current status of treatment for HCC with PVTT was reviewed. A Medline search was undertaken to identify articles using the keywords \"HCC\", \"PVTT\" and \"therapy\". Additional papers were identified by a manual search of the references from the key articles. PVTT, as a common complication of HCC, was divided into type I \u223c IV. The therapeutic approach is mainly composed of five types: surgical resection, regional interventional therapy, radiotherapy, combination therapy, targeted therapy. All of these therapeutic approaches were separately evaluated in detail. For those resectable tumors, the better choice for treatment of HCC with PVTT should be hepatectomy and removal of PVTT. For those unresectable tumors, TACE (especially the super-selective TACE) has been the preferred palliative treatment, the other regional interventional therapy and/or radiotherapy could improve the therapeutic effects. The multidisciplinary treatments may further improve the quality of life and prolong the survival period for the HCC patients associated with PVTT.", "Application of silicone rubber passive samplers to investigate the bioaccumulation of PAHs by Nereis virens from marine sediments.\nThe availability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from marine sediments to the ragworm (Nereis virens) was studied. Concentrations of PAHs in pore waters were determined using silicone rubber passive samplers. Calculated bioconcentration factors confirmed that partitioning of PAHs between the lipid phase of the polychaetes and pore water is a passive process. Low biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAF) calculated using total sediment concentration suggested a fraction of the total PAH burden in the sediment may be strongly sorbed to organic carbon and not available to the polychaete. Organic carbon normalised concentrations of the potentially exchangeable fractions of contaminants and freely dissolved concentrations (measured using silicone rubber samplers) provide a better description of the observed bioaccumulation by the ragworms. These data indicate that the concept of availability should be included in environmental risk assessments based upon equilibrium partitioning models, and that silicone rubber samplers can provide the necessary information for these models.", "Influence of crank length and crank width on maximal hand cycling power and cadence.\nThe effect of different crank lengths and crank widths on maximal hand cycling power, cadence and handle speed were determined. Crank lengths and crank widths were adapted to anthropometric data of the participants as the ratio to forward reach (FR) and shoulder breadth (SB), respectively. 25 able-bodied subjects performed maximal inertial load hand cycle ergometry using crank lengths of 19, 22.5 and 26% of FR and 72, 85 and 98% of SB. Maximum power ranged from 754 (246) W for the crank geometry short wide (crank length x crank width) to 873 (293) W for the combination long middle. Every crank length differed significantly (P < 0.05) from each other, whereas no significant effect of crank width to maximum power output was revealed. Optimal cadence decreased significantly (P < 0.001) with increasing crank length from 124.8 (0.9) rpm for the short to 107.5 (1.6) rpm for the long cranks, whereas optimal handle speed increased significantly (P < 0.001) with increasing crank length from 1.81 (0.01) m/s for the short to 2.13 (0.03) m/s for the long cranks. Crank width did neither influence optimal cadence nor optimal handle speed significantly. From the results of this study, for maximum hand cycling power, a crank length to FR ratio of 26% for a crank width to SB ratio of 85% is recommended.", "Prospective evaluation of risk factors of cutaneous drug reactions to sulfonamides in patients with AIDS.\nPersons with HIV infection have increased rates of drug eruptions. Our aim was to evaluate the risk factors of drug eruptions in response to sulfonamides in patients with AIDS, using a case-control analysis. One hundred thirty-six patients who were hospitalized for pneumocystosis or toxoplasmosis were evaluated at the onset of treatment for various risk factors, which were then compared among patients with (48, 36%) and without (88, 64%) a drug eruption. In multivariate analysis, high CD8(+) cell count and age less than 36 years indicated a risk of drug eruption (respective odds ratios: 3.5 [95% CI 1.6-7.8], P =.002, and 2.1 [95% CI 1-4.6], P =.06). Markers of viral replication for HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 6, and parvovirus B19, slow acetylation phenotype or genotype, and glutathione level were not associated with a risk. Administration of corticosteroids had no preventive effect. Our results challenge several current concepts regarding drug eruptions by discarding a strong association with glutathione deficiency, slow acetylation, or active viral infections and by showing no preventive effect of corticosteroids.", "Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia: differential diagnosis by computerized tomography.\nThis study was designed to clarify chest computerized tomography (CT) findings of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia facilitating differential diagnosis from CAP (community acquired pneumonia) caused by other organisms. We retrospectively reviewed the CT findings of 36 patients (median age 33 years, 15 males, 21 females) with serologically proven M. pneumoniae pneumonia and 52 patients (median age 61 years, 37 males, 15 females) suffering from CAP with no serological evidence of M. pneumoniae infection. The CT images were analyzed by experienced pulmonologists. The most common finding in the M. pneumoniae pneumonia group was bronchial wall thickening, when we compared it with the CAP group (p<0.0001, Fisher's exact probability test). In the CAP group infected with other organisms, dense consolidations with air bronchograms were more frequent than any other findings (p=0.0279, chi-square test). The diagnosis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia would appear to be reliable when we found bronchial wall thickening in the chest CT images.", "Autoimmune insulitis and diabetes in the absence of antigen-specific contact between T cells and islet beta-cells.\nAutoimmune diabetes develops following recognition of organ-specific antigens by T cells. The disease begins with peri-islet infiltration by mononuclear cells, proceeds with insulitis and becomes manifest with destruction of insulin-producing islet beta-cells. T cells are necessary to induce insulitis and diabetes, but it is not clear by what mechanisms they can do so, i. e. whether the T cells need to make antigen-specific contact with the beta-cell or whether other interactions are sufficient to induce beta-cell death. In the present study we have constructed chimeric mice in which the bone marrow-derived antigen-presenting cells, but not the islet beta-cells, are capable of presenting antigen to monospecific T cells. We show that both insulitis as well as beta-cell destruction can proceed in the absence of islet beta-cell surface antigen recognition by T cells. Our results support the notion that diabetes can be caused by distinct effector mechanisms.", "Environmental risk assessment of white phosphorus from the use of munitions - a probabilistic approach.\nWhite phosphorus (P(4)) is a highly toxic compound used in various pyrotechnic products. Ammunitions containing P(4) are widely used in military training areas where the unburned products of P(4) contaminate soil and local ponds. Traditional risk assessment methods presuppose a homogeneous spatial distribution of pollutants. The distribution of P(4) in military training areas is heterogeneous, which reduces the probability of potential receptors being exposed to the P(4) by ingestion, for example. The current approach to assess the environmental risk from the use of P(4) suggests a Bayesian network (Bn) as a risk assessment tool. The probabilistic reasoning supported by a Bn allows us to take into account the heterogeneous distribution of P(4). Furthermore, one can combine empirical data and expert knowledge, which allows the inclusion of all kinds of data that are relevant to the problem. The current work includes an example of the use of the Bn as a risk assessment tool where the risk for P(4) poisoning in humans and grazing animals at a military shooting range in Northern Norway was calculated. P(4) was detected in several craters on the range at concentrations up to 5.7g/kg. The risk to human health was considered acceptable under the current land use. The risk for grazing animals such as sheep, however, was higher, suggesting that precautionary measures may be advisable.", "Real-world evidence of suboptimal blood pressure control in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nIn order to eventually improve blood pressure (BP) management, the aim of this study was to identify subgroups of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with distinct trajectories of SBP levels. Identifying subgroups with distinct SBP trajectories helps to better understand the course of SBP levels in T2DM patients and its associated consequences. Subgroup characteristics were determined and the prevalence of complications and mortality rates over time in the different subgroups was investigated. Five thousand, seven hundred and eleven T2DM patients with at least two SBP follow-up measurements were selected from a prospective T2DM cohort of 9849 T2DM patients. The mean follow-up period was 5.7 years (range 2-9 years). Latent Class Growth Modeling, as currently the most flexible cluster analysis available, was performed to identify subgroups of patients with distinct SBP trajectories. Subgroup characteristics were determined by multinomial logistic regression analyses. Four subgroups with distinct SBP trajectories were identified. The largest subgroup (85.6%) showed adequate SBP control (at or around 140 mmHg) over time. The second subgroup (5.6%) were hypertensive in the first years, responded slowly to BP management and eventually reached SBP control. The third subgroup (3.4%) showed deteriorating hypertension during the first 4 years, then showed insufficient response to BP management. The fourth subgroup (5.4%) showed deteriorating hypertension over time. Patients within subgroups 2-4 were significantly older, comprised more women, used more antihypertensive medication and had a higher prevalence of retinopathy, microalbuminuria and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. More than 85% reached and maintained adequate SBP control. Subgroups with a more unfavourable course of SBP control also showed higher rates of microvascular complications and CVD mortality over time. This study identified important subgroups to target in order to improve BP management in T2DM patients.", "Pulmonary diffusing capacity in healthy African-American and Caucasian children.\nPrevious studies of pulmonary diffusing capacity in healthy children primarily focused upon Caucasian (C) subjects. Since lung volumes in African-Americans (AA) are smaller than lung volumes in C subjects of the same height, diffusing capacity values in AA children might be interpreted as low or abnormal using currently available equations without adjusting for race. Healthy AA (N = 151) and C (N = 301) children between 5 and 18 years of age performed acceptable measurements of single breath pulmonary diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO ) and alveolar volume (VA ) according to current ATS/ERS guidelines. The natural log of DLCO and VA were associated with height, gender, age, and race; AA children had lower DLCO and VA compared to C children. Adjustment of DLCO for Hemoglobin (Hgb) resulted in no significant difference in DLCO among these healthy subjects with normal Hgb. In summary, we report prediction equations for DLCO and VA that include adjustment for race (C; AA) demonstrating that AA have lower DLCO and VA compared to C children for the same height, gender, and age.", "Temperature dependence of steady-state and presteady-state kinetics of a type IIb Na+/P i cotransporter.\nThe temperature dependence of the transport kinetics of flounder Na(+)-coupled inorganic phosphate (P(i)) cotransporters (NaPi-IIb) expressed in Xenopus oocytes was investigated using radiotracer and electrophysiological assays. (32)P(i) uptake was strongly temperature-dependent and decreased by approximately 80% at a temperature change from 25 degrees C to 5 degrees C. The corresponding activation energy (E (a)) was approximately 14 kcal mol(-1) for the cotransport mode. The temperature dependence of the cotransport and leak modes was determined from electrogenic responses to 1 mM P(i) and phosphonoformic acid (PFA), respectively, under voltage clamp. The magnitude of the P(i)- and PFA-induced changes in holding current decreased with temperature. E (a) at -100 mV for the cotransport and leak modes was approximately 16 kcal mol(-1) and approximately 11 kcal mol(-1), respectively, which suggested that the leak is mediated by a carrier, rather than a channel, mechanism. Moreover, E (a) for cotransport was voltage-independent, suggesting that a major conformational change in the transport cycle is electroneutral. To identify partial reactions that confer temperature dependence, we acquired presteady-state currents at different temperatures with 0 mM P(i) over a range of external Na(+). The relaxation time constants increased, and the peak time constant shifted toward more positive potentials with decreasing temperature. Likewise, there was a depolarizing shift of the charge distribution, whereas the total available charge and apparent valency predicted from single Boltzmann fits were temperature-independent. These effects were explained by an increased temperature sensitivity of the Na(+)-debinding rate compared with the other voltage-dependent rate constants.", "MOS transistors (such as power MOSFETs or IGBTs) can be switched on and off by charging and discharging the gate of the transistor. In order to control the transition between a non-conductive (off-state) and a conductive state (on-state), and vice versa, a gate-resistor is usually connected to a gate electrode of the transistor. The resistance of the gate-resistor limits the gate current that charges or discharges the gate. For charging and discharging the gate capacitor of power MOS transistors, dedicated gate driver circuits (or simply gate drivers) are used. Such gate drivers charge and discharge the gate in response to one or more logic signals (binary signals) which may represent the desired switching state (on or off) of the transistor.\nIn some applications it is desired to have different gate current values for charging and, respectively, discharging the gate of a MOS transistor. Different gate current values for charging and discharging the gate result in an asymmetric switching, i.e., the switching times are significantly different for switching transistor on and off. Such an asymmetric switching behavior may be achieved, for example, by using appropriately designed gate driver circuits. Such gate drivers usually require a relatively complicated circuit design. Furthermore, various undesired effects may occur due to unavoidable parasitic circuit components present within such gate driver circuits. Thus there is a need for an improved MOS transistor which allows asymmetric switching without the need for sophisticated gate driver circuits.", "Combining both a pressure sensor and a temperature sensor in a single package can reduce overall sensor cost in control or telemetry applications where it is necessary to measure more than one parameter of fluid media in a vessel. For example, various automotive suppliers produce and sell sensors designed to mount on the intake manifold of an internal combustion engine for measuring both the absolute pressure (MAP) and the temperature (MAT) of air in the manifold. Typically, the sensor package includes a measurement port that passes through a wall of the intake manifold into the manifold air stream, and a pressure sensor sealed against the inboard end of the port. The manifold air temperature is measured by a thermistor disposed in the manifold air stream but within the port, and the leads of the thermistor are terminated in the sensor package adjacent the pressure sensor. One example of such a sensor is the MAP/MAT Sensor manufactured and marketed by Delphi Corporation.\nWhile the above-described sensor configuration can be used to advantage in low-pressure applications (i.e., 15 p.s.i. or less), it is problematic in high-pressure applications (such as a turbocharged engine) due to the difficulty of forming a leak-free seal around the leads of the thermistor, even if the sensor housing is molded around the leads. Leakage around the sensor leads is undesirable not only because of manifold air pressure loss, but also because the manifold air (or other media) can contaminate the pressure sensor and associated electronic devices. Accordingly, what is needed is a combined pressure/temperature sensor that is particularly suited to high-pressure applications.", "Comparison of Minimally Invasive Direct Coronary Artery Bypass and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Using Second-Generation Drug-Eluting Stents for Coronary Artery Disease - Propensity Score-Matched Analysis.\nSome studies comparing minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have reported MIDCAB's superiority, but they did not investigate contemporary PCI with newer generation drug-eluting stents (DES). We compared clinical outcomes after MIDCAB with previously reported outcomes after PCI with second-generation DES.Methods and Results:We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients treated with MIDCAB. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes after MIDCAB were compared with those for left anterior descending artery disease treated via PCI. The primary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and target vessel revascularization (TVR). A propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis was conducted to adjust for between-group differences in baseline characteristics. We analyzed 77 patients treated with MIDCAB and 2,206 treated with PCI. The MIDCAB group was older and had more severe coronary disease and a higher incidence of left ventricular dysfunction. Over a 3-year follow-up, the PCI group had favorable MACCE outcomes. After PSM, there were no between-group differences in MACCE (MIDCAB, 15.6% vs. PCI, 23.4%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI: 0.38-1.68, P=0.548) or TVR (MIDCAB, 2.6% vs. PCI, 5.2%; HR, 0.51; 95% CI: 0.10-3.09, P=0.509). Clinical outcomes were similar between MIDCAB and PCI using second-generation DES over 3 years of follow-up.", "Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas of immunoblastic type are a major reservoir for MYC-IGH translocations.\nThe immunoblastic variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (IB-DLBCL) has recently been recognized as an aggressive lymphoma type with inferior prognosis as compared with other DLBCL variants. At the same time, the presence of MYC rearrangements in DLBCL has been shown to indicate shorter survival in R-CHOP-treated patients. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of MYC gene rearrangements in IB-DLBCL versus non-IB-DLBCL in a large series. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization with an MYC break-apart and MYC-IGH fusion probe, we found that 13/39 evaluable IB-DLBCLs (33%) harbor translocations involving MYC, in contrast with only 5/68 (7%) in the non-IB-DLBCL group (P<0.01). The immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) was the translocation partner in all rearrangements (100%) involving MYC in IB-DLBCL, which is in contrast to what has been reported for DLBCL in the literature (50% to 70%). Moreover, MYC rearrangements occurred as the sole translocation in the majority of cases (77%), whereas across all DLBCLs the majority of MYC-rearranged cases carry additional rearrangements of either BCL2 and/or BCL6 genes (between 58% and 83% of cases). Finally, MYC-rearranged IB-DLBCLs were CD10 positive in 62% (8/13), whereas this was an uncommon feature in MYC germline IB-DLBCLs (15%). In conclusion, IB-DLBCLs are genetically characterized by frequent MYC-IGH translocations that often occur without additional BCL2 and/or BCL6 translocations. The activation of MYC, therefore, may be an important pathogenetic feature in IB-DLBCL.", "Acceptability of urine-based screening for Chlamydia trachomatis in asymptomatic young men: a systematic review.\nWe performed a structured literature review of published studies from 2000-2007 that measured the acceptability and acceptance (uptake) of urine testing for C. trachomatis among asymptomatic men. Studies were categorized as three types: (a) non-STD clinic venues where men were approached in person and offered testing on site (urgent care clinics, freestanding clinics or health screening settings, corrections, community centers); (b) delivery of testing kits to men at their homes; and (c) qualitative measurement related to men's experience of screening. When offered in established nonhome-based settings (clinics, schools, corrections), acceptability and consequent uptake of testing by men is generally good (mid-60% range). However, acceptance rates even in these settings vary widely and are influenced by venue, provider, and a diversity of other factors. Acceptance of home-based testing invitations, including direct mailing of test kits, is considerably lower. Attitudinal characteristics of men who decline testing primarily include low self-perception of risk for asymptomatic infection and perceived inconvenience of providing test specimens. Given these findings, testing strategies targeting asymptomatic men in established community and clinic settings are most likely to yield relatively high acceptance rates. However, barriers to both implementation and uptake remain, even when such testing is free. Interventions to enhance uptake of testing in asymptomatic men should be developed and selected with underlying C. trachomatis population prevalence in mind.", "Communication: angular momentum alignment and fluorescence polarization of alkali atoms photodetached from helium nanodroplets.\nThe theory of photofragments angular momentum polarization is applied to the photodetachment of an electronically excited alkali atom from a helium nanocluster (N = 200). The alignment of the electronic angular momentum of the bare excited alkali atoms produced is calculated quantum mechanically by solving the excited states coupled equations with potentials determined by density functional theory (DFT). Pronounced oscillations as a function of excitation energy are predicted for the case of Na@(He)200, in marked contrast with the absorption cross-section and angular distribution of the ejected atoms which are smooth functions of the energy. These oscillations are due to quantum interference between different coherently excited photodetachment pathways. Experimentally, these oscillations should be reflected in the fluorescence polarization and polarization-resolved photoelectron yield of the ejected atoms, which are proportional to the electronic angular momentum alignment. In addition, this result is much more general than the test case of NaHe200 studied here. It should be observable for larger droplets, for higher excited electronic states, and for other alkali as well as for alkali-earth atoms. Detection of these oscillations would show that the widely used pseudo-diatomic model can be valid beyond the prediction of absorption spectra and could help in interpreting parts of the dynamics, as already hinted by some experimental results on angular anisotropy of bare alkali fragments.", "Migraine prophylactic drugs work via ion channels.\nIn recent decades, the concept of a vascular origin of migraine has been replaced by theories based on a neuronal pathophysiology. These theories all involve rapid changes in the functioning of the brain, particularly the brain stem, and the trigeminal nerves. While such paroxysmal changes in function could be the result of altered synaptic transmission, or other physiological changes, they could also be due to changes in the function of voltage-regulated sodium and calcium ion channels. Support for this view of migraine as a channelopathy comes from an examination of the likely mechanism of action of migraine prophylactic drugs. It is the present hypothesis that most of the widely used drugs for migraine prevention work by inhibiting the function of one or both of these ion channels. A review of the laboratory research done on most of the commonly used migraine prophylactic drugs, divided into five classes, reveals that they all may work on sodium channels, calcium channels, or both. If this is the common mechanism of action of migraine prophylactics, it should lead toward the development of more effective prophylactic drugs.", "Effects of recent Leptospira vaccination on whole blood real-time PCR testing in healthy client-owned dogs.\nBacterin-based canine Leptospira vaccines could present a challenge for the use of whole blood real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a diagnostic tool. Recent vaccination could induce positive results if the targeted DNA fragment is present within the vaccine and in the blood of the recently vaccinated dog. The objective of this study was to assess whether 2 available 4-serovar vaccines induce a positive real-time PCR reaction in the blood of healthy recently vaccinated dogs. Twenty healthy dogs. This was a prospective study. Dogs were assigned to 1 of 2 vaccine groups. Both vaccines were culture-based and include Leptospira interrogans serovars Pomona, Canicola, and Icterohaemorrhagiae and Leptospira kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa. Whole blood for real-time PCR and serum for the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) were collected prior to and 3 and 7 days after vaccination and weekly thereafter for 8 weeks. Two real-time PCR tests targeting 2 different genes were performed independently in a blinded fashion. Both Leptospira vaccines produced positive real-time PCR reactions when assayed undiluted or diluted 1 : 100 in canine blood. However, blood samples drawn from all dogs at all time points after vaccination were negative on PCR. All dogs developed MAT titers. Recent vaccination with 2 commercially available vaccines does not interfere with the use of real-time PCR for the identification of acute Leptospira infection in dogs.", "Acute ammonia neurotoxicity in vivo involves increase in cytoplasmic protein P53 without alterations in other markers of apoptosis.\nAcute intoxication with large ammonia doses leads to activation of NMDA receptors in the brain, resulting in oxidative stress and disturbance of mitochondrial function. Altered mitochondrial function is a crucial step in some mechanisms of cellular apoptosis. This study assesses whether ammonia intoxication in vivo leads to induction of apoptotic markers such as permeability transition pore (PTP) formation, caspase-3, and caspase-9 activation, changes in p53 protein, or cytochrome c release. Acute ammonia intoxication did not affect caspase-9 or caspase-3 activities. The mitochondrial membrane potential also remained unaltered in non-synaptic brain mitochondria after injection of ammonia, indicating that ammonia did not induce PTP formation in brain in vivo. The nuclear level of p53 did not change, whereas its cytoplasmic level increased approximately two-fold. In agreement with the theory that translocation of the p53 from cytosol to nuclei is an essential step for induction of apoptosis we did not find apoptotic nuclei in brain of rats injected with ammonia. This supports the idea that ammonia neurotoxicity does not involve apoptosis and points to impaired p53 transfer from cytoplasm to nuclei as a possible preventer of apoptosis. We did not find any release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol after ammonia injection. Cytochrome c content was significantly reduced (30%) in brain mitochondria from rats injected with ammonia. This decrease may contribute to the reduced state 3 respiration, decreased respiratory control index, and disturbances in the mitochondrial electron transport chain in brain mitochondria from rats injected with ammonia.", "An unusual case of progressive shock and highly elevated procalcitonin level.\nA 21-year-old man with signs and symptoms of rapidly progressive shock was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment of suspected sepsis. Levels of inflammatory markers (including procalcitonin) were highly elevated, but no obvious focus of infection was apparent. Initial sepsis therapy included administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasoconstrictors, and drotrecogin alfa. Cultures of blood, sputum, and urine showed no growth, and no viruses were detected. The random (no stimulation with corticotropin) cortisol level at admission was less than 25 nmol/L. Assays for autoantibodies to the adrenal cortex were strongly positive and confirmed the diagnosis of adrenal failure caused by Addison disease. After initiation of steroid therapy, the patient fully recovered. Although increased procalcitonin levels are considered a reliable and specific indicator of severe generalized infections and bacterial sepsis, elevated procalcitonin levels cannot be relied on when trying to differentiate between addisonian crisis and septic shock.", "The role of teosinte glume architecture (tga1) in coordinated regulation and evolution of grass glumes and inflorescence axes.\n\u2022 Hardened floral bracts and modifications to the inflorescence axis of grasses have been hypothesized to protect seeds from predation and/or aid seed dispersal, and have evolved multiple times independently within the family. Previous studies have demonstrated that mutations in the maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) gene teosinte glume architecture (tga1) underlie a reduction in hardened structures, yielding free fruits that are easy to harvest. It remains unclear whether the causative mutation(s) occurred in the cis-regulatory or protein-coding regions of tga1, and whether similar mutations in TGA1-like genes can explain variation in the dispersal unit in related grasses. \u2022 To address these questions TGA1-like genes were cloned and sequenced from a number of grasses and analyzed phylogenetically in relation to morphology; protein expression was investigated by immunolocalization. \u2022 TGA1-like proteins were expressed throughout the spikelet in the early development of all grasses, and throughout the flower of the grass relative Joinvillea. Later in development, expression patterns differed between Tripsacum dactyloides, maize and teosinte (Z. mays ssp. parviglumis). \u2022 These results suggest an ancestral role for TGA1-like genes in early spikelet development, but do not support the hypothesis that TGA1-like genes have been repeatedly modified to affect glume and inflorescence axis diversification.", "Platelet serotonin transporters and the transporter gene in control subjects, unipolar patients and bipolar patients.\nThe purpose of the present study was to relate the number of platelet serotonin transporters in unipolar and bipolar patients and in control subjects to two polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene: a VNTR in intron 2 and a deletion/insertion in the promoter region. Density of platelet serotonin transporters was determined by radioligand binding analysis. Genotyping was performed by PCR amplification of polymorphic regions followed by size determination of the obtained fragments. The control subjects and the two groups of patients were similar with respect to the genotype and allele distribution belonging to the two polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene for. An interaction between status (control, unipolar- or bipolar patient) and VNTR genotype regarding the number of platelet serotonin transporters was observed; unipolar patients with the genotype 12/10 had more platelet serotonin transporters than bipolar patients and controls with this genotype. No association related to the polymorphism was found in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene. An association was observed between the polymorphism in intron 2 of the serotonin transporter gene and the number of platelet serotonin transporters. Unipolar patients with a particular genotype had more platelet serotonin transporters than the corresponding controls and bipolar patients.", "The prevalence and clinical associations of HTLV-1 infection in a remote Indigenous community.\nHospital and laboratory data indicate that human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is endemic to central Australia, but no community-based studies of its prevalence or disease burden have been reported. We determined the prevalence rates of HTLV-1 infection and of HTLV-1-associated diseases in a remote Indigenous community. A remote Northern Territory community. All residents were asked to complete a health survey and offered a limited clinical examination, together with serological tests for HTLV-1 and Strongyloides, and HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) assessment. HTLV-1 seropositivity rates; HTLV-1 PVL (copies/105 peripheral blood leucocytes [PBL]); presentation with HTLV-1-related clinical disease. HTLV-1 serostatus was determined for 97 of 138 residents (70%). The prevalence of HTLV-1 infection was significantly higher among adults (30 of 74 people tested) than children (1 of 23; P = 0.001). Nine of 30 HTLV-1-positive adults had a clinical syndrome that was potentially attributable to HTLV-1 infection (chronic lung disease, seven; symptomatic strongyloidiasis, two). The median HTLV-1 PVL was significantly higher for adults with chronic lung disease than for those who were asymptomatic (chronic lung disease, 649 copies/105 PBL [IQR, 162-2220]; asymptomatic adults, 40 copies/105 PBL [IQR, 0.9-229]; P = 0.017). Ten of 72 adults tested were seropositive for Strongyloides (six of 28 HTLV-1-positive participants and four of 44 HTLV-1-negative participants; P = 0.17), as were three of 15 children tested; the three children were HTLV-1-negative. The prevalence of HTLV-1 infection and the rate of disease potentially attributable to HTLV-1 were high among adults in this remote community.", "Association analysis of polymorphisms in the upstream region of the human dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) with schizophrenia and personality traits.\nThe human dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) is of major interest in molccular studies of schizophrenia and personality traits. We examined the association of schizophrenia and polymorphisms in the upstream region of the DRD4 gene (-768G>A in the negative modulator region; -521C>T, -376C >T, and -291C>T in the cell type-specific promoter region; and -616C>G between the two regions) in 208 schizophrenic patients and 210 normal controls. No significant difference in genotype and allele frequencies was observed between the two groups, indicating that these polymorphisms do not make a major contribution to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We also studied the association of polymorphisms in the upstream region and a 48-bp repeat polymorphism in exon III of the DRD4 gene with personality traits in 173 Japanese individuals who completed the temperament and character inventory (TCI). The -768G>A polymorphism was significantly associated with reward dependence (P= 0.044), while no significant association was observed between novelty seeking and polymorphisms in the upstream region or the exon III repeat polymorphism of the DRD4 gene.", "Neelaredoxin, an iron-binding protein from the syphilis spirochete, Treponema pallidum, is a superoxide reductase.\nTreponema pallidum, the causative agent of venereal syphilis, is a microaerophilic obligate pathogen of humans. As it disseminates hematogenously and invades a wide range of tissues, T. pallidum presumably must tolerate substantial oxidative stress. Analysis of the T. pallidum genome indicates that the syphilis spirochete lacks most of the iron-binding proteins present in many other bacterial pathogens, including the oxidative defense enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase, but does possess an orthologue (TP0823) for neelaredoxin, an enzyme of hyperthermophilic and sulfate-reducing anaerobes shown to possess superoxide reductase activity. To analyze the potential role of neelaredoxin in treponemal oxidative defense, we examined the biochemical, spectroscopic, and antioxidant properties of recombinant T. pallidum neelaredoxin. Neelaredoxin was shown to be expressed in T. pallidum by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Recombinant neelaredoxin is a 26-kDa alpha(2) homodimer containing, on average, 0.7 iron atoms/subunit. M\u00f6ssbauer and EPR analysis of the purified protein indicates that the iron atom exists as a mononuclear center in a mixture of high spin ferrous and ferric oxidation states. The fully oxidized form, obtained by the addition of K(3)(Fe(CN)(6)), exhibits an optical spectrum with absorbances at 280, 320, and 656 nm; the last feature is responsible for the protein's blue color, which disappears upon ascorbate reduction. The fully oxidized protein has a A(280)/A(656) ratio of 10.3. Enzymatic studies revealed that T. pallidum neelaredoxin is able to catalyze a redox equilibrium between superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, a result consistent with it being a superoxide reductase. This finding, the first description of a T. pallidum iron-binding protein, indicates that the syphilis spirochete copes with oxidative stress via a primitive mechanism, which, thus far, has not been described in pathogenic bacteria.", "The antiangiogenic tissue kallikrein pattern of endothelial cells in systemic sclerosis.\nPostnatal angiogenesis relies on a proper response of endothelial cells to angiogenic stimuli. In systemic sclerosis (SSc), endothelial cells are unresponsive to angiogenic factors. Since circumstantial and experimental evidence points to tissue kallikreins as powerful effectors of the angiogenic response, we undertook this study to investigate the kallikrein pattern of normal and SSc endothelial cells in order to identify differences that can account for defective angiogenesis. Expression of 14 tissue kallikreins was studied by a microarray approach, by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and by Western blotting in endothelial cells isolated from the skin of clinically healthy subjects and SSc patients. Cell proliferation was quantified by direct cell counting. Invasion and capillary morphogenesis were evaluated in a Boyden chamber and in culture flasks layered with Matrigel. Cyclic nucleotide production was measured by enzyme immunoassay. MAP kinase and ERK activation were measured by Western blotting. Endothelial cells from SSc patients showed poor expression of kallikreins 9, 11, and 12 compared with endothelial cells from normal subjects. Antibodies against the relevant kallikreins on normal endothelial cells revealed that while kallikreins 9, 11, and 12 induced cell growth, only kallikrein 12 regulated invasion and capillary morphogenesis. Buffering of kallikrein 12 with antibodies resulted in the acquisition of an SSc-like pattern by normal cells in in vitro angiogenesis. Reduction of cAMP and cGMP production and of ERK phosphorylation upon administration of antikallikrein antibodies revealed that the activity of kallikreins 9, 11, and 12 was mediated by kinins. Reduction of tissue kallikreins 9, 11, and 12 may be relevant to reduced angiogenesis in SSc patients.", "Precis: Nitric oxide (NO) is a soluble gas continuously synthesized by the endothelium that contributes importantly to vasodilator tone of the coronary and systemic circulations by activating guanylyl cyclase in vascular smooth muscle. Patients with coronary artery disease, however, have deficient synthesis or increased degradation of NO due to endothelial damage or dysfunction. Reduced NO could contribute to symptoms and progression of coronary artery disease through vasoconstriction, platelet activation, inflammatory cell attachment to the arterial wall, and increased growth of cellular elements of the vessel wall. We have recently determined that nitrite, formed by the auto-oxidation of NO, can be converted to bioactive NO, in part through reactions with deoxyheme proteins that exist not only in red blood cells, but also within the vessel wall. An alternative source of bioactive NO may be via the diet, as nitrates found in vegetables and cured meats may be converted to nitrite by action of nitrate reductases present in oral bacteria. Nitrite may then be converted to NO within the acidic environment in the stomach and absorbed into the bloodstream, or absorbed directly and converted to NO in the bloodstream via reaction with deoxyheme proteins. This study is designed to determine the contribution of dietary nitrate/nitrite to NO adducts in blood and to vascular dilator tone assessed directly in the forearm and indirectly through treadmill exercise testing. Findings in this study may have important clinical implications not only in coronary artery disease, but also in other conditions associated with regional endothelial dysfunction and reduced endothelial NO bioactivity (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, estrogen deficiency), and possibly account for the cardiovascular benefit of diets rich in vegetables shown in epidemiological survey studies.", "Adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization after curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma: a non-randomized comparative study.\nPrevention of recurrence is the most important strategy to improve long-term survival after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This comparative study aimed to evaluate the outcome of adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) after hepatectomy. From February 1996 and September 2001, 721 consecutive patients (adjuvant TACE treatment vs. control group; 145 vs. 576) with R0 resection for HCC were analyzed. The prospective data was analyzed retrospectively. After a median follow-up of 75 months, 89 patients (61.4%) in the adjuvant TACE group and 355 patients (61.6%) in the control group had recurrent disease. There was no significant difference in the tumor recurrence rate between the 2 groups. There was significant difference in the tumor recurrence time between the 2 groups. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 96.5%, 70.0% and 55.9%, respectively, for the adjuvant TACE group and 80.8%, 49.7% and 38.8%, respectively, for the control group. The 1-, 3- and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 79.9%, 54.9% and 48.4%, respectively, for the adjuvant TACE group and 60.2%, 39.8% and 31.5%, respectively, for the control group. The differences in the disease-free survival rates and the overall survival rates between the 2 groups were significant. In subgroup analysis, there was significant survival benefit in the adjuvant TACE group in the subgroup of patients with risk factors of recurrence - large tumor size, presence of satellite tumor nodules and narrow resection margin. Adjuvant TACE improved surgical outcome in those patients with risk factors of HCC recurrence.", "Internal vs external generation of movements: differential neural pathways involved in bimanual coordination performed in the presence or absence of augmented visual feedback.\nIt is commonly agreed that a functional dissociation with respect to the internal vs external control of movements exists for several brain regions. This has, however, only been tested in relation to the timing and preparation of motor responses, but not to ongoing movement control. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study addressed the neuroanatomical substrate of the internal-external control hypothesis by comparing regional brain activation for cyclical bimanual movements performed in the presence or absence of augmented visual feedback. Subjects performed a bimanual movement pattern, either with the help of on-line visual feedback of the movements (externally guided coordination) or with the eyes closed on the basis of an internal representation of the movement pattern (internally generated coordination). Visual control and baseline rest conditions were also added. Results showed a clear functional dissociation within the network involved in movement coordination. The hMT/V5+, the superior parietal cortex, the premotor cortex, the thalamus, and cerebellar lobule VI showed higher activation levels when movements were guided by visual feedback. Conversely, the basal ganglia, the supplementary motor area, cingulate motor cortex, the inferior parietal, frontal operculum, and cerebellar lobule IV-V/dentate nucleus showed higher involvement when movements were internally generated. Consequently, the present findings suggest the existence of distinct cortico-cortical and subcortico-cortical neural pathways for externally (augmented feedback) and internally guided cyclical bimanual movements. This provides a neurophysiological account for the beneficial effect of providing augmented visual feedback to optimize movements in normal and motor disordered patients.", "Free-radical-induced oxidative and reductive degradation of N,N'-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET): Kinetic studies and degradation pathway.\nN,N'-Diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) is widely used as an insect repellent and has therefore been detected as a contaminant in numerous waste and surface waters. In this study we have determined the absolute reaction rate constants of DEET with the hydroxyl radical and the hydrated electron in aqueous solution as (4.95+/-0.18)x10(9) and (1.34+/-0.04)x10(9) M(-1) s(-1), respectively, using pulse radiation. To provide additional information on the radicals formed upon oxidation, transient spectra were measured from 1 to 150 micros, with transient decay rates determined from the time-dependence of the maximum absorption at 330 nm. These data suggest simple decay of the initially formed radical to stable products. Radical-based destruction mechanisms for destruction of DEET are proposed based on the LC-MS determination of the stable compounds produced by 60Co gamma-irradiation of DEET solutions. These data will be useful in evaluating potential advanced oxidation/reduction processes for the control of DEET and understanding its fate and transport in surface water where analogous radical chemistry is operative.", "[Calcified aortic valve stenosis in adults. Analysis of supra- and infra-hissian conduction disorders].\nThe association of intraventricular or atrio-ventricular conductive disorders with a calcified aortic stenosis, is a classical notion demonstrated by the close anatomical relationships between aortic valve and conduction pathways. These conductive disorders have been, for quite some time, analyzed on standard electrocardiograms, but, since a few years, the recording of the bundle of His potential has become the technique of choice. However, studies regarding this subject are few, based on very small and sometimes heterogeneous groups of patients. Sixty six consecutive patients hospitalized for a narrow aortic stenosis have agreed to be subjected, before valve replacement, to a recording of the bundle of His potential. Thirteen of them (19.7%) show a HV interval exceeding 55 ms or a pathological H deflexion (twisted and lasting 35 ms). None of the pre-operative parameters that were analyzed (black-out, left ventricular function, ventriculo-aortic gradient, calculated valvular area, magnitude of valvular and ring calcifications), seem correlated with the increased HV interval. These results cross-check those reported in most of the literature.", "Patient Satisfaction with Outpatient Physiotherapy Services in Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital, Nepal.\nBackground The quality of care provided to recipients of health services is measured by the satisfaction of patient. Patient satisfaction is the extent to which patient feels that their needs and expectations have been met on behalf of their expenses made to get quality health services. Satisfied patients adhere to the treatment plan, seek for further services and provide feedback. Therefore, such study in Nepal would be important and first of its kind to assess the quality of physiotherapy services. Objective To evaluate the level of satisfaction of patient receiving outpatient Physiotherapy services and the relationship between the items within the questionnaire. Method The MedRisk Instrument for Measuring Patient Satisfaction (MRPS) with Physical Therapy Care was administered to 256 patients to identify the level of patient satisfaction. Result There was a high level of satisfaction of patient receiving Outpatient physiotherapy services using MRPS (Mean = 4.18; SD = 0.39). The relationships between individual item scores and Global satisfaction (Item 11) were explored with bivariate correlation analysis. The Internal factors correlated most strongly with the global satisfaction whereas the external factors had the lowest correlation with the global satisfaction. Conclusion Patient satisfaction is an important aspect of the measurement of quality of care. Thus, it must be evaluated timely to provide quality services to the patients. There was high level of satisfaction reported by patient receiving outpatient physiotherapy services in the Dhulikhel Hospital.", "Micromachined hot-wire thermal conductivity probe for biomedical applications.\nThis paper presents the design, fabrication, numerical simulation, and experimental validation of a micromachined probe that measures thermal conductivity of biological tissues. The probe consists of a pair of resistive line heating elements and resistance temperature detector sensors, which were fabricated by using planar photolithography on a glass substrate. The numerical analysis revealed that the thermal conductivity and diffusivity can be determined by the temperature response induced by the uniform heat flux in the heating elements. After calibrating the probe using a material (agar gel) of known thermal conductivity, the probe was deployed to calculate the thermal conductivity of Crisco. The measured value is in agreement with that determined by the macro-hot-wire probe method to within 3%. Finally, the micro thermal probe was used to investigate the change of thermal conductivity of pig liver before and after RF ablation treatment. The results show an increase in thermal conductivity of liver after the RF ablation.", "Role of caspases in human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis.\nIn the present study, we have used an in vitro model of apoptosis using primary human renal proximal tubular epithelial (RPTE) cells to investigate the mechanisms involved in renal cell apoptosis. Treatment of RPTE cells with okadaic acid for 24-48 h induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Apoptosis was accompanied by the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway followed by the activation of caspase-9, -3, and -7. The induction of caspase activity correlated with the proteolytic cleavage of beta-catenin, suggesting that beta-catenin is a caspase substrate. The caspase inhibitor, Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk), resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of apoptosis and beta-catenin cleavage. These data suggest that okadaic acid-induced apoptosis is p38 MAPK and caspase-dependent and that proteolytic cleavage of beta-catenin by caspases is likely to be a downstream molecular event associated with the morphological and cytoskeletal changes induced during apoptosis.", "Insulin in methionine and homocysteine kinetics in healthy humans: plasma vs. intracellular models.\nMethionine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is reversibly converted into homocysteine. Homocysteine is an independent cardiovascular risk factor frequently associated with the insulin resistance syndrome. The effects of insulin on methionine and homocysteine kinetics in vivo are not known. Six middle-aged male volunteers were infused with L-[methyl-2H3,1-13C]methionine before (for 3 h) and after (for 3 additional hours) an euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (150 mU/l) clamp. Steady-state methionine and homocysteine kinetics were determined using either plasma (i.e., those of methionine) or intracellular (i.e., those of plasma homocysteine) enrichments. By use of plasma enrichments, insulin decreased methionine rate of appearance (Ra; both methyl- and carbon Ra) by 25% (P < 0.003 vs. basal) and methionine disposal into proteins by 50% (P < 0.0005), whereas it increased homocysteine clearance by approximately 70% (P < 0.025). With intracellular enrichments, insulin increased all kinetic rates, mainly because homocysteine enrichment decreased by approximately 40% (P < 0.001). In particular, transmethylation increased sixfold (P < 0.02), transsulfuration fourfold (P = 0.01), remethylation eightfold (P < 0.025), and clearance eightfold (P < 0.004). In summary, 1) physiological hyperinsulinemia stimulated homocysteine metabolic clearance irrespective of the model used; and 2) divergent changes in plasma methionine and homocysteine enrichments were observed after hyperinsulinemia, resulting in different changes in methionine and homocysteine kinetics. In conclusion, insulin increases homocysteine clearance in vivo and may thus prevent homocysteine accumulation in body fluids. Use of plasma homocysteine as a surrogate of intracellular methionine enrichment, after acute perturbations such as insulin infusion, needs to be critically reassessed.", "The present invention is directed to a drying apparatus for a metallic belt or strand which has been processed by being passed through a fluid. More specifically, the drying apparatus is for a metallic strand coming from an acid treating plant. The drying apparatus basically comprises two opposed blower systems for directing hot air from above and below the strand. The hot air blowers extend fully across the belt width of the maximum belt or strand which might be dried by the apparatus and also extends some distance in the lengthwise direction of the strand. The hot air is directed to the belt by an air blower which first directs the air through a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger serves to heat the air which is then directed to the blower systems.\nAccording to the prior art, drying apparatus of this type have been constructed by calculating the heat output needed for the maximum belt width and the maximum speed of movement of a belt. In this manner, for belts of less than maximum width, energy in the form of hot air is passed purposelessly into the environment. The spectrum of belt widths in a processing line for such metallic belts ranges between 600 and 1,550 mm. The surrounding air, drawn into an air blower by suction, is generally heated in the heat exchanger to a temperature of between about 373.degree. to 423.degree. K., i.e., 100.degree.-150.degree. C., prior to the air being directed to the blower systems for drying.", "Administration of Fortifier by Finger Feeder During Breastfeeding in Preterm Infants.\nTo evaluate the acceptance, adherence, and feasibility of fortifier administration by finger feeder during breastfeeding and to determine weight, length, and head circumference gains after discharge for preterm infants. Observational pilot study. A Level III NICU and its outpatient clinic in Vienna, Austria. Infants born at younger than 34 weeks gestation were included. Mothers were screened in a tertiary NICU and trained by certified lactation consultants to administer fortifier with a finger feeder during breastfeeding. Data on finger feeder use at home were collected by self-reported feeding diaries and questionnaires. In total, data from 24 mother-infant dyads were analyzed. The acceptance rate was 67%. In 41.7%, more than 50% of meals were fortified. Mothers did not report problems in preparation, but 33% of the infants stopped latching on or drooled milk during finger feeder use. Use of a finger feeder to administer fortifier to preterm infants enabled mothers to exclusively breastfeed their infants and meet their nutritional needs. The development of further methods to augment preterm infant nutrition that do not interfere with breastfeeding is of great interest.", "Diurnal variation in skeletal muscle and liver glycogen in humans with normal health and Type 2 diabetes.\nIn health, food carbohydrate is stored as glycogen in muscle and liver, preventing a deleterious rise in osmotically active plasma glucose after eating. Glycogen concentrations increase sequentially after each meal to peak in the evening, and fall to fasting levels thereafter. Skeletal muscle accounts for the larger part of this diurnal buffering capacity with liver also contributing. The effectiveness of this diurnal mechanism has not been previously studied in Type 2 diabetes. We have quantified the changes in muscle and liver glycogen concentration with 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3.0 T before and after three meals consumed at 4 h intervals. We studied 40 (25 males; 15 females) well-controlled Type 2 diabetes subjects on metformin only (HbA1c (glycated haemoglobin) 6.4\u00b10.07% or 47\u00b10.8 mmol/mol) and 14 (8 males; 6 females) glucose-tolerant controls matched for age, weight and body mass index (BMI). Muscle glycogen concentration increased by 17% after day-long eating in the control group (68.1\u00b14.8 to 79.7\u00b14.2 mmol/l; P=0.006), and this change inversely correlated with homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR] (r=-0.56; P=0.02). There was no change in muscle glycogen in the Type 2 diabetes group after day-long eating (68.3\u00b12.6 to 67.1\u00b12.0 mmol/mol; P=0.62). Liver glycogen rose similarly in normal control (325.9\u00b125.0 to 388.1\u00b130.3 mmol/l; P=0.005) and Type 2 diabetes groups (296.1\u00b116.0 to 350.5\u00b16.7 mmol/l; P<0.0001). In early Type 2 diabetes, the major physiological mechanism for skeletal muscle postprandial glycogen storage is completely inactive. This is directly related to insulin resistance, although liver glycogen storage is normal.", "Outcome of primary repair in extremely and very low-birth-weight infants with esophageal atresia/distal tracheoesophageal fistula.\nThe optimal surgical management of extremely (ELBW) and very low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonates with esophageal atresia and distal tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) (Gross type C) is still debated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the surgical outcome of primary repair in these patients and compare it to \u22651500g neonates. Medical records of neonates with repaired EA from 2002 to 2016 were reviewed. 4 ELBW, 7 VLBW, and 24 \u22651500g infants had type C EA/TEF and underwent primary repair. Anastomotic leakage occurred in 0% ELBW, 0% VLBW and 8.3% \u22651500g patients and anastomotic stricture in 25% ELBW, 28.5% VLBW and 37.5% \u22651500g patients. 50% ELBW, 14.2% VLBW and 20.8% \u22651500g patients underwent secondary fundoplication. One patient of the VLBW group and one patient of the \u22651500g group died postoperatively of causes not related to EA/TEF. In extremely and very low-birth-weight neonates with type C EA/TEF surgical outcome after primary repair is comparable to the outcome in \u22651500g neonates. Primary repair can be performed in most of these patients and staged repair can be restricted to unstable patients. Treatment study level III.", "CD58 and CD59 molecules exhibit potentializing effects in T cell adhesion and activation.\nWe have generated stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transfectants expressing either CD58 or CD59 or both molecules to compare their respective parts played in T cell adhesion and activation. Using a rosetting assay, we have shown the following: 1) The CD59 molecule was directly responsible for adhesive interaction between human T cells and CD59+ CHO transfectants. CD59-mediated adhesion induced 12 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM, n = 25) of rosettes. 2) The CD58 molecule expressed on CD58+ CHO transfectants induced 29 +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM, n = 8) of rosettes. 3) Double transfected CD58+CD59+ CHO cells formed up to 80% of rosettes, largely exceeding the sum of rosettes formed by single transfectants, thus disclosing at least an additive and possibly a synergic action of both molecules in mediating adhesion to T cells. Culturing purified human T cells in the presence of fixed CHO transfectants and submitogenic doses of PHA + rIL-1 alpha showed that: 1) CD59+ CHO transfectants induced sevenfold T cell proliferation enhancement, demonstrating the direct involvement of the CD59 molecule in T cell activation; 2) CD58+ CHO transfectants induced 20-fold T cell proliferation increase; and 3) the enhancement induced by CD58+CD59+ CHO cells was more than 40-fold. These results suggest that CD58 and CD59 molecules present on the surface of accessory cells might exert synergic function in T cell adhesive interactions and in the stimulation of T cell activation.", "Malignant gliomas are rapidly growing primary brain tumors associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Current management is based on cytoreduction through a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite this multidisciplinary approach to treatment, malignant glioma remains a life-threatening disease. This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase II reference agent trial designed to determine the efficacy and safety of temozolomide in the treatment of patients with GBM at first relapse. The reference agent is included to verify that objective responses for procarbazine, can be seen within the definition of the protocol in a contemporaneously randomized group of patients using state-of-the-art techniques, and to allow a contrast of the reference agent to the literature. The primary objectives are to determine the efficacy of temozolomide defined as progression-free survival at 6 months and safety of temozolomide when administered orally. The secondary objectives are: a) to describe the health-related quality of life of all patients enrolled on temozolomide and the reference agent, procarbazine b) to assess population-based pharmacokinetics in patients receiving temozolomide and c) to assess overall survival for all patients enrolled on temozolomide and the reference agent procarbazine. Enrollment has just begun.", "Inhibitory processing during the Go/NoGo task: an ERP analysis of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\nPrevious event-related potential (ERP) research on inhibitory functioning in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) has often failed to use tasks which optimally assess inhibition. We report on an improved measure of inhibitory function, involving inhibition of a prepotent response, in children with AD/HD. Twelve males with AD/HD and 12 control males, aged 7-12 years, completed a cued Go/NoGo task where Go stimuli were presented on 70% of trials. ERP and behavioural measures were collected, together with reading, spelling and full-scale IQ scores. The behavioural performance of children with AD/HD was not significantly different from normal controls, although children with AD/HD made faster responses and more errors. Group differences were apparent in the early processing components (P1, N1, P2) of responses to Warning, Go and NoGo stimuli. For the frontally maximal N2, a NoGo>Go effect was found, consistent with previous work linking this component with inhibitory processing. In control children this effect was particularly strong in the right frontal region, while children with AD/HD showed a much larger NoGo>Go effect, and an earlier N2 peak, than controls, with a focal shift to the left frontal region. Compared with normal controls, children with AD/HD demonstrate early stimulus processing atypicalities, suggesting problems with sensory registration and identification of stimuli. Further, N2 results suggest that children with AD/HD must trigger the inhibition process earlier and more strongly than controls to perform at a comparable behavioural level. The results support the theory that behavioural inhibition is deficient in AD/HD, as children with AD/HD show abnormalities in inhibitory ERP components relating to the effort involved in inhibiting a prepotent response.", "The effects of caffeine and Ca2+ on rigor tension in triton-treated rat ventricular trabeculae.\nVentricular trabeculae from rat heart were chemically skinned with Triton-X 100, which disrupts all cellular membranes including the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Trabeculae developed a maintained rigor contracture when adenosine triphosphate was withdrawn from the bathing medium. In all preparations, the final level of rigor force developed in the presence of caffeine (10-40 mM) was greater than under control conditions. However, caffeine failed to increase rigor tension when applied after contracture had fully developed. The effect of caffeine on rigor was maximal at about 15 mM; concentrations greater or less than 15 mM were less effective. On average, caffeine decreased the time required to develop half-maximum rigor force. The caffeine-induced potentiation of rigor force occurred in the effective absence of Ca2+ (10(-9) M), in solutions strongly Ca(2+)-buffered with [ethylenebis(oxonitrilo)]tetraaceticacid (10-50 mM). In all preparations, rigor force was found to be independent of [Ca2+] over the range 10(-10) M to about 10(-7) M. These results suggest that caffeine affects rigor force by a direct effect on the myofilaments via a mechanism that is independent of Ca2+.", "In vivo knee moments and shear after total knee arthroplasty.\nTibiofemoral loading is very important in cartilage degeneration as well as in component survivorship after total knee arthroplasty. We have previously reported the axial knee forces in vivo. In this study, a second-generation force-sensing device that measured all six components of tibial forces was implanted in a 74-kg, 83-year-old male. Video motion analysis, ground reaction forces, and knee forces were measured during walking, stair climbing, chair-rise, and squat activities. Peak total force was 2.3 times body weight (BW) during walking, 2.5 x BW during chair rise, 3.0 x BW during stair climbing, and 2.1 x BW during squatting. Peak anterior shear force at the tibial tray was 0.30 x BW during walking, 0.17 x BW during chair rise, 0.26 x BW during stair climbing, and 0.15 x BW during squatting. Peak flexion moment at the tray was 1.9% BW x Ht (percentage of body weight multiplied by height) for chair-rise activity and 1.7% BW x Ht for squat activity. Peak adduction moment at the tray was -1.1% BW x Ht during chair-rise, -1.3% BW x Ht during squatting. External knee flexion and adduction moments were substantially greater than flexion and adduction moments at the tray. The axial component of forces predominated especially during the stance phase of walking. Shear forces and moments at the tray were very modest compared to total knee forces. These findings indicate that the soft tissues around the knee absorbed most of the external shear forces. Our results highlight the importance of direct measurements of knee forces.", "Keepers of the secret: desires to conceal a family member's HIV-positive status in Namibia, Africa.\nWhen people learn that they have tested positive for HIV, they may share their news with a family member; and this family listener may want them to keep their diagnosis a secret. This study extends privacy management research (e.g., Petronio, 2002) by investigating variables related to family members' desires to keep HIV-status secrets. Two studies, 2 years apart, included adult-respondents (N = 1,358) in northern Namibia, where HIV is prevalent. Two factors predicted potential co-owners' desires to keep a family member's HIV-positive status secret: (a) the sense of an environment inappropriate for disclosure, and (b) a lack of efficacy to oppose it. These findings suggest that many factors translated from disclosers to co-owners and from (primarily) Western studies of disclosure to southern Africa. From this investigation, one might consider the contexts that redistribute power so that confidants may limit discloser's rights to share his or her own information.", "The severity of chewing disorders is related to gross motor function and trunk control in children with cerebral palsy.\nThe frequency of chewing disorders increases with decreasing level of gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Besides its frequency, the severity of chewing disorders is also important. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between chewing performance level and gross motor function, and trunk postural control in children with CP. The study included 119 children with CP (age 2-10 years). Chewing performance level was determined by the Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale (KCPS). The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) was used to determine the level of gross motor function. Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control (SATCo) was used to measure trunk control. Children with spastic CP with a median age of 4 years were evaluated, of which 50.4% were male. The percentages of patients classified to GMFCS levels I to V were 43.7%, 6.7%, 9.2%, 5.0%, and 35.3%, respectively. The median KCPS score was 3 (min = 0, max = 4). A good correlation was found between KCPS and GMFCS (p < .001, r = 0.70). Negative, excellent correlations between KCPS and SATCo static, SATCo active, and SATCo reactive postural controls were found (p < .001, r = -0.75, r = -0.77, r = -0.79; respectively). The severity of chewing disorders is related to the level of gross motor function and trunk postural control in children with CP. Clinical trial number: NCT03241160.", "Manganese stimulates the incorporation of [3H]inositol into a pool of phosphatidylinositol in brain that is not coupled to agonist-induced hydrolysis.\nMn2+ greatly increases the incorporation of myo-[3H]inositol into phosphatidylinositol (PI) of brain and other tissues by stimulating the activity of a PI-myo-inositol exchange enzyme. This study examined the ability of norepinephrine (NE) and carbachol to stimulate the hydrolysis of [3H]PI formed in the absence and presence of Mn2+-stimulated [3H]inositol exchange. Rat cerebral cortical slices were incubated with myo-[3H]inositol for 60 min in an N-2-hydroxyethyl piperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer without or with MnCl2 (1 mM). The tissue was washed and further incubated with unlabeled myo-inositol and LiCl (10 mM). Prelabeled slices were then incubated with NE (0.1 mM) or carbachol (1 mM) to induce agonist-stimulated [3H]PI hydrolysis. Mn2+ treatment resulted in eight- and sixfold increases in control levels of [3H]PI and [3H]inositol monophosphate [( 3H]IP), respectively. Both NE and carbachol stimulated [3H]IP formation in tissue prelabeled without or with manganese. However, the degree of stimulation (percentage of control values) was greatly attenuated in the presence of Mn2+. In the absence of Mn2+ treatment, NE decreased [3H]PI radioactivity in the tissue to 80% of control values. However, NE did not decrease [3H]PI radioactivity in the Mn2+-treated tissue. These data demonstrate that Mn2+ stimulates incorporation of myo-[3H]inositol into a pool of PI in brain that has a rapid turnover but is not coupled to agonist-induced hydrolysis.", "Immune response to Rhodococcus equi ATCC 33701-secreted proteins in mice and identification of immunogenic recombinant proteins by dot-blotting.\nRhodococcus equi remains a significant pathogen, causing severe pneumonia in foals. The development of vaccines and serologic diagnosis could be greatly facilitated by studying the humoral immune response to this equine pathogen. In this study, a crude extract of R. equi ATCC 33701-secreted proteins combined with the Montanide\u00ae ISA70 adjuvant was found to be highly immunogenic in mice with the highest titer of 99,000 on day 42 after the first subcutaneous immunization. This immune response was dependent on the quantity of proteins injected and the presence of adjuvant. By dot-blotting, eight recombinant secreted proteins were identified to react strongly with sera from immunized mice. Of these eight proteins, four were detected as immunogenic only when administered in conjunction with adjuvant. This screening strategy led to the identification of promising new candidates for vaccine development.", "Oral Administration of (S)-Allyl-l-Cysteine and Aged Garlic Extract to Rats: Determination of Metabolites and Their Pharmacokinetics.\n(S)-Allyl-l-cysteine is the major bioactive compound in garlic. (S)-Allyl-l-cysteine is metabolized to (S)-allyl-l-cysteine sulfoxide, N-acetyl-(S)-allyl-l-cysteine, and N-acetyl-(S)-allyl-l-cysteine sulfoxide after oral administration. An accurate LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of (S)-allyl-l-cysteine and its metabolites in rat plasma, and the feasibility of using it in pharmacokinetic studies was tested. The analytes were quantified by multiple reaction monitoring using an atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometer. Because significant quantitative interference was observed between (S)-allyl-l-cysteine and N-acetyl-(S)-allyl-l-cysteine as a result of the decomposition of N-acetyl-(S)-allyl-l-cysteine at the detector source, chromatographic separation was required to discriminate (S)-allyl-l-cysteine and its metabolites on a reversed-phase C18 analytical column with a gradient mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile. The calibration curves of (S)-allyl-l-cysteine, (S)-allyl-l-cysteine sulfoxide, N-acetyl-(S)-allyl-l-cysteine, and N-acetyl-(S)-allyl-l-cysteine sulfoxide were linear over each concentration range, and the lower limits of quantification were 0.1 \u00b5g/mL [(S)-allyl-l-cysteine and N-acetyl-(S)-allyl-l-cysteine] and 0.25 \u00b5g/mL [(S)-allyl-l-cysteine sulfoxide and N-acetyl-(S)-allyl-l-cysteine sulfoxide]. Acceptable intraday and inter-day precisions and accuracies were obtained at three concentration levels. The method satisfied the regulatory requirements for matrix effects, recovery, and stability. The validated LC-MS/MS method was successfully used to determine the concentration of (S)-allyl-l-cysteine and its metabolites in rat plasma samples after the administration of (S)-allyl-l-cysteine or aged garlic extract.", "Selective galactose culture condition reveals distinct metabolic signatures in pyruvate dehydrogenase and complex I deficient human skin fibroblasts.\nA decline in mitochondrial function represents a key factor of a large number of inborn errors of metabolism, which lead to an extremely heterogeneous group of disorders. To gain insight into the biochemical consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction, we performed a metabolic profiling study in human skin fibroblasts using galactose stress medium, which forces cells to rely on mitochondrial metabolism. Fibroblasts from controls, complex I and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) deficient patients were grown under glucose or galactose culture condition. We investigated extracellular flux using Seahorse XF24 cell analyzer and assessed metabolome fingerprints using NMR spectroscopy. Incubation of fibroblasts in galactose leads to an increase in oxygen consumption and decrease in extracellular acidification rate, confirming adaptation to a more aerobic metabolism. NMR allowed rapid profiling of 41 intracellular metabolites and revealed clear separation of mitochondrial defects from controls under galactose using partial least squares discriminant analysis. We found changes in classical markers of mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction, as well as unexpected markers of amino acid and choline metabolism. PDH deficient cell lines showed distinct upregulation of glutaminolytic metabolism and accumulation of branched-chain amino acids, while complex I deficient cell lines were characterized by increased levels in choline metabolites under galactose. Our results show the relevance of selective culture methods in discriminating normal from metabolic deficient cells. The study indicates that untargeted fingerprinting NMR profiles provide physiological insight on metabolic adaptations and can be used to distinguish cellular metabolic adaptations in PDH and complex I deficient fibroblasts.", "Ethanol-induced vasoconstriction is mediated via redox-sensitive cyclo-oxygenase-dependent mechanisms.\nThe present study investigated the role of ROS (reactive oxygen species) and COX (cyclo-oxygenase) in ethanol-induced contraction and elevation of [Ca2+]i (intracellular [Ca2+]). Vascular reactivity experiments, using standard muscle bath procedures, showed that ethanol (1-800 mmol/l) induced contraction in endothelium-intact (EC50: 306+/-34 mmol/l) and endothelium -denuded (EC50: 180+/-40 mmol/l) rat aortic rings. Endothelial removal enhanced ethanol-induced contraction. Preincubation of intact rings with L-NAME [NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester; non-selective NOS (NO synthase) inhibitor, 100 micromol/l], 7-nitroindazole [selective nNOS (neuronal NOS) inhibitor, 100 micromol/l], oxyhaemoglobin (NO scavenger, 10 micromol/l) and ODQ (selective inhibitor of guanylate cyclase enzyme, 1 micromol/l) increased ethanol-induced contraction. Tiron [O2- (superoxide anion) scavenger, 1 mmol/l] and catalase (H2O2 scavenger, 300 units/ml) reduced ethanol-induced contraction to a similar extent in both endothelium-intact and denuded rings. Similarly, indomethacin (non-selective COX inhibitor, 10 micromol/l), SC560 (selective COX-1 inhibitor, 1 micromol/l), AH6809 [PGF2alpha (prostaglandin F2alpha)] receptor antagonist, 10 micromol/l] or SQ29584 [PGH2(prostaglandin H2)/TXA2 (thromboxane A2) receptor antagonist, 3 micromol/l] inhibited ethanol-induced contraction in aortic rings with and without intact endothelium. In cultured aortic VSMCs (vascular smooth muscle cells), ethanol stimulated generation of O2- and H2O2. Ethanol induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i, which was significantly inhibited in VSMCs pre-exposed to tiron or indomethacin. Our data suggest that ethanol induces vasoconstriction via redox-sensitive and COX-dependent pathways, probably through direct effects on ROS production and Ca2+ signalling. These findings identify putative molecular mechanisms whereby ethanol, at high concentrations, influences vascular reactivity. Whether similar phenomena occur in vivo at lower concentrations of ethanol remains unclear.", "Possible involvement of truncated signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 in the GH pattern-dependent regulation of CYP2C12 gene expression in rat liver.\nThe transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)5a and Stat5b have been implicated in the GH regulation of CYP2C genes in rodent liver. In addition to full-length Stat5 isoforms, truncated Stat5 proteins (Stat5beta), lacking the transactivating domain, have been demonstrated. In this study we found that Stat5beta can be formed by proteolytic cleavage in rat liver nuclei and that the activity of the protease is independent of GH. The GH regulation of the female-specific CYP2C12 gene has recently been shown to be conveyed by two adjacent Stat5-binding elements in the 5'-upstream region. We found that binding of Stat5 in liver nuclear extracts to this site involved simultaneous binding of two Stat5 dimers, most likely both Stat5b homodimers and Stat5a/Stat5b heterodimers. We also investigated Stat5 binding to a potential composite Stat5 element in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of CYP2C12. Several Stat5 complexes were formed on this element including Stat5beta-containing complexes. In transient transfection experiments we could demonstrate that the 3'-UTR element reduced GH activation of a CYP2C12-luciferase reporter construct harboring the 5'-Stat5 elements. We speculate that binding of Stat5beta to the 3'-UTR element could be of relevance for the GH-dependent and sex-specific expression of CYP2C12.", "[Comparative characteristic of preoperative magnetic resonance and intraoperative cholangiography in diagnostics of the common biliary duct disorder].\nThe investigation objective have had constituted comparative characteristic of the magnet resonance cholangiography (MRCHG) and intraoperative cholangiography (IOCHG), which were applied in 186 patients, suffering biliary calculous disease. Basing on results of the performed standard operational investigations, three groups of the general biliary duct (GBD) risk affection were delineated: high, middle and low. In the high risk group were included 82 patients, in whom in GBD its widening and echopositive mass presence were revealed, as well as cholangitis, pancreatitis, obturation jaundice and raising of the cholestatic enzymes activity. The middle risk group was presented by 41 patients, in whom the ultrasound investigations data did not show the changes, but nonspecific raising of the hepatic enzymes activity was registered or they have had jaundice and pancreatitis in anamnesis. In the low risk groups were included 63 patients, in whom preoperative investigations did not show pathologic changes. The GBD affection was diagnosed in 82 patients. The investigation results have shown, that along with lowering of the GBD risk affection revealing, the MRCHG sensitivity lowers (in the groups--93.1, 80 and 57.1%, accordingly), and specificity is raising (90, 96.7 and 98.2%). Conduction of intraoperative cholangiography is indicated to all patients in high and middle risk of GBD affection, in low risk--in necessity. In a distal affection of GBD MRCHG owes low sensitivity and specificity.", "High-speed observation of acoustic cavitation erosion in multibubble systems.\nCleaning and erosion of objects by ultrasound in liquids are caused by the action of acoustic cavitation bubbles. Experiments have been performed with respect to the erosive effect of multibubble structures on painted glass surfaces and on aluminium foils in an ultrasonic standing wave field at 40 kHz. High-speed imaging techniques have been employed to investigate the mechanisms at work, in particular bubble interaction and cluster formation near and at the object surfaces. It was found that different prototype bubble structures can contribute to the erosion process. Some are bound to the surface, which seems to act as a bubble source in this case, while others also exist independently from the object. Cleaning and erosion effects at the pressure antinodes can vary strongly as they depend on the emerging bubble structures. These, in turn, seem to be substantially influenced by properties and the history of the surface.", "Left Ventricular Contraction Pattern in Chronic Aortic Regurgitation and Preserved Ejection Fraction: Simultaneous Stress-Strain Analysis by Three-Dimensional Echocardiography.\nThe role of speckle-tracking echocardiography in the assessment of chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) is not established. Load dependency may encumber the interpretation of strain measurements in the chronically overloaded left ventricle. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of left ventricular (LV) contraction patterns in asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe AR and preserved ejection fractions. In this prospective, cross-sectional study, 31 patients with moderate to severe AR, 15 elite endurance athletes, and 17 healthy control subjects were examined using three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. Global circumferential strain (GCS), global longitudinal strain (GLS), end-systolic circumferential wall stress (ESSc), end-systolic meridional wall stress (ESSm), and the wall stress ratio (ESSc/ESSm) were measured. LV end-diastolic volumes were similar in athletes and patients with AR and significantly larger than in healthy control subjects. Values of GLS in control subjects, athletes, and patients with AR were -18.8 \u00b1 1.9%, -17.3 \u00b1 2.0%, and -16.4\u00b1 2.0%, respectively (control subjects vs athletes and patients, P < .05), whereas values of GCS were -16.9 \u00b1 2.0%, -15.5 \u00b1 1.9%, and -17.9 \u00b1 2.6%, respectively (athletes vs control subjects and patients, P < .01). The ESSc/ESSm ratio was lower in patients with AR (P < .01). When adjusted for ESSm, GLS remained impaired in patients compared with control subjects and athletes (P = .015). On the other hand, GCS was better in patients with AR when adjusted for ESSc (P = .003). In compensated AR, relatively high GCS compensates for reduced GLS in a manner consistent with the preserved ejection fractions observed in these patients.", "Scanning electron microscopic study of the tegumental surface of adult Schistosoma sinensium.\nThe SEM study of tegumental surface of adult Schistosoma sinensium reveals that the male tegument lacks tubercles or bosses; instead it is corrugated with small pits or perforated ridges. On the dorsal surface, spines are present whose number and size progressively increase towards the posterior end of the body. In addition, there are three types of papillae interspersed among the ridges and spines. The first type of papillae has crater-like holes surrounded by a circular doughnut-shaped elevation; some are ciliated and others are non-ciliated. They are generally found on the dorsal and ventral surfaces. The second is sensory papillae which are hemispherical in shape bearing apical cilia. They are found to be concentrated around the oral sucker and on the posterior end of the worm. The third is fungiform papillae without cilia which are found on the posterior end. There are short spines present on the tegument lining the gynecophoral canal of the male worm. The tegument of the female S. sinensium is corrugated with ridges on the ventral surface. Small spines are present on the anterior portion of the dorsal surface. They become larger and increased in number towards the posterior end of the worm. The three types of papillae are present but they are much fewer and less developed than those in the male worm.", "The Impact of Morning versus Afternoon Exercise on Iron Absorption in Athletes.\nThis study examined postexercise inflammatory, hepcidin, and iron absorption responses to endurance exercise performed in the morning versus the afternoon. Sixteen endurance-trained runners (10 male, 6 female) with serum ferritin (sFer) < 50 \u03bcg\u00b7L completed a 90-min running protocol (65% vV\u02d9O2max) in the morning (AM), or the afternoon (PM), in a crossover design. An iron-fortified fluid labeled with stable iron isotopes (Fe or Fe) was administered with a standardized meal 30 min following the exercise and control conditions during each trial, serving as a breakfast and dinner meal. Venous blood samples were collected before, immediately after, and 3 h after the exercise and control conditions to measure sFer, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), and serum hepcidin-25. A final venous blood sample was collected 14 d after each trial to determine the erythrocyte iron incorporation, which was used to calculate iron absorption. Linear mixed-modeling was used to analyze the data. Overall, exercise significantly increased the concentrations of IL-6 (4.938 pg\u00b7mL; P = 0.006), and hepcidin-25 concentrations significantly increased 3 h after exercise by 0.380 nM (P < 0.001). During the PM trial, hepcidin concentrations exhibited diurnal tendency, increasing 0.55 nM at rest (P = 0.007), before further increasing 0.68 nM (P < 0.001) from prerun to 3 h postrun. Fractional iron absorption was significantly greater at breakfast after the AM run, compared with both the rested condition (0.778%; P = 0.020) and dinner in the AM run trial (0.672%; P = 0.011). Although exercise resulted in increased concentrations of IL-6 and hepcidin, iron was best absorbed in the morning after exercise, indicating there may be a transient mechanism during the acute postexercise window to promote iron absorption opposing the homeostatic regulation by serum hepcidin elevations.", "An aminolytic approach toward hierarchical \u03b2-Ni(OH)(2) nanoporous architectures: a bimodal forum for photocatalytic and surface-enhanced raman scattering activity.\nA surfactantless, trouble-free, and gentle wet chemistry approach has been used to interpret the precisely controlled growth of \u03b2-Ni(OH)(2) with the assistance of ammonia and nickel acetate from seedless mild hydrothermal conditions. A thorough investigation of the reaction kinetics and product morphology with varied concentration of NH(3) and different reaction times suggests that a putative mechanism of dissolution, recrystallization, and oriented attachment supports the intelligent self-assembly of nanobuilding blocks. Associated characterizations (FTIR, PXRD, FESEM, EDAX, HRTEM, and Raman) have identified it to be pure \u03b2-Ni(OH)(2) without any signature of contamination. The assembled units result in porous frameworks (nanoflowers and nanocolumns) and are indeed full of communally intersecting nanopetals/nanoplates with both lengths and widths on the order of micrometer to nanometer length scale. The as-synthesized material could also be used as a precursor for nanometric black NiO under calcination. The hydroxide has been found to be a potent and environmentally benign material because it warrants its photocatalytic activity through dye mineralization. Finally, Ni(OH)(2) has been photochemically derivatized with dosages of silver nanoparticles bringing a competent composite authority Ag@Ni(OH)(2), to give a full-proof enhanced field effect of prolific SERS activity. In a nutshell, these results are encouraging and fetch new promise for the fabrication of a low-cost and high-yielding greener synthetic protocol for a functional material with promising practicability.", "Voice quality of psychological origin.\nVariations in voice quality are essentially related to modifications of the glottal source parameters, such as: F0, jitter, and shimmer. Voice quality is affected by prosody, emotional state, and vocal pathologies. Psychogenic vocal pathology is particularly interesting. In the present case study, the speaker naturally presented a ventricular band voice whereas in a controlled production he was able to use a more normal phonation process. A small corpus was recorded which included sustained vowels and short sentences in both registers. A normal speaker was also recorded in similar tasks. Annotation and extraction of parameters were made using Praat's voice report function. Application of the Hoarseness Diagram to sustained productions situates this case in the pseudo-glottic phonation region. Analysis of several different parameters related to F0, jitter, shimmer, and harmonicity revealed that the speaker with psychogenic voice was capable of controlling certain parameters (e.g. F0 maximum) but was unable to correct others such as shimmer.", "The spectrum of laparoscopic surgery.\nLaparoscopic procedures have begun to replace many conventional operations because of the avoidance of major surgery and the rapid recovery of the patient. The majority of these traditional operations will be performed laparoscopically in the future. For example, patients who suffer from achalasia will be able to undergo laparoscopic cardiomyotomy and patients with non-cardiac chest pain of esophageal origin will be able to undergo thoracoscopic myotomy. Likewise, a viable alternative to long-term medication with H2 blockers or omeprazole will be laparoscopic posterior vagotomy and anterior lesser curve seromyotomy. As methods are developed to deal with the extraction of large specimens, many ablative procedures will be undertaken by the laparoscopic route. Extraction techniques must not compromise the need for histopathological examination of the resected specimen in cancer resections. The ultimate spectrum of laparoscopic surgery will be determined by the progress in remote handling technology, overcoming the manipulative restrictions inherent in the current instrumentation. Research evaluating the efficacy of new methods will be essential.", "Prevalence and clinical characteristics of white-coat hypertension based on different definition criteria in untreated and treated patients.\nThe prevalence and associated risks of white-coat hypertension (WCH) are still a matter of debate. We aimed to assess differences in prevalence and associated conditions of WCH defined on the basis of the normality of all daytime, night-time, and 24-h blood pressure (BP), only daytime, or only 24-h BP. We selected 115 708 patients (45 020 untreated and 70 688 treated) from the Spanish Ambulatory BP Monitoring Registry. WCH was estimated in patients with elevated office BP (\u2265140 and/or 90 mmHg) by using normal daytime (<135/85) BP, normal 24-h BP (<130/80), or normal daytime, night-time (<120/70) and 24-h BP. Demographic and clinical data (associated risk factors and organ damage) were compared among groups. Prevalence of WCH was 41.3, 35.2, and 26.1% in untreated, and 45.8, 38.9, and 27.2% in treated patients with elevated office BP, by using the criteria of daytime, 24-h, or all ambulatory periods. Compared with the normotensive group, WCH defined by normal daytime, night-time, and 24-h BP did not significantly differ in terms of other cardiovascular risk factors or organ damage. In contrast, patients from other groups (either only normal daytime BP or 24-h BP) had significantly more prevalence of diabetes, dyslipidaemia, microalbuminuria, left ventricular hypertrophy, reduced renal function, and previous history of cardiovascular disease. Prevalence of WCH is dependent on definition criteria. Only diagnostic criteria which considers the normality of all ambulatory periods identifies patients with cardiovascular risk similar to normotensive patients. These results support using such criteria for a more accurate definition of WCH.", "Temperature-responsive polymeric nanospheres containing methotrexate and gold nanoparticles: A multi-drug system for theranostic in rheumatoid arthritis.\nInflammation plays a crucial role in rheumatoid arthritis progress. In the present work, a novel stealth polymeric nanospheres platform able to carry anti-inflammatory drugs and an imaging agent was developed. Incorporation of gold nanoparticles will allow photoacoustic imaging and near infra-red photothermal application. Through emulsion-diffusion evaporation technique methotrexate and gold nanoparticles were incorporated in the pegylated-poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanospheres. In vitro drug release assays revealed pH and temperature-dependence on gold nanoparticles. Blank nanospheres exhibited negligible in vitro cytotoxicity, while methotrexate-loaded nanospheres hampered monocytes and macrophages viability at a higher level than free methotrexate. Confocal fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry revealed effective nanospheres internalization, and that their cellular uptake was energy dependent mediated by caveolae and clathrin-endocytosis mechanism. Finally, MTX-loaded multifunctional nanospheres containing gold lead to a significant reduction of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 inflammatory cytokines produced by monocytes and macrophages upon in vitro inflammatory stimulation, suggesting a favorable anti-inflammatory activity. These results confirm that the multifunctional nanospheres represent a promising theranostic platform for RA diagnosis and intracellular treatment, by combining methotrexate and gold nanoparticles for a highly effective targeted chemo-photothermal therapy.", "Circulating thyroid hormones in progressive renal failure in the baboon (Papio ursinus).\nIn order to examine the effects of developing renal failure on circulating thyroid hormones, serum concentrations of thyroxine (T4), free T4 (FT4), triiodothyronine (T3) and reverse T3 (rT3) and TBG capacity were measured in 9 baboons before and during the progress of acute (mean survival 12 days), subacute (32 days) and chronic (120 days) renal failure following allogeneic renal transplantation. Irrespective of the rate of development of renal failure, there were significant, non linear (power functions) negative correlations between serum creatinine or urea concentrations and levels of T4, FT4 and T3; rT3 levels remained unchanged, but the T4: rT3 molar ratio fell from 236.5 +/- 61 (+/- SE) to 121.8 +/- 30.9 (p less than 0.05). T4 and T3 levels were invariably subnormal at creatinine concentrations greater than 250 mumol/l (2.8 mg/dl), but FT4 was subnormal only in chronic renal failure. Thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) capacity did not change significantly; thus the TBG: T4 ratio increased from 3.4 +/- 0.2 (basal) to 10.4 +/- 3.4 before death (p less than 0.05). In animals which survived for greater than 25 days after transplantation, a significant linear correlation between FT4 and T3 was found as uremia progressed. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (pH 7.4) of (125I)-T4 labelled preoperative and uremic serum showed a consistent decline in the proportion of tracer bound to TBG, from 67.0 +/- 0.8% to 58.9 +/- 1.0% (p less than 0.001), with a 48% reduction in TBG saturation (p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "Genetics of sex determination: what can we learn from Drosophila?\nThe combined efforts of genetics, developmental and molecular biology have revealed the principles of genetic control of sexual differentiation in Drosophila. In combination with maternal components, a quantitative chromosomal signal, provided by the ratio of X chromosomes to sets of autosomes (X:A), regulates a key gene (Sxl). The functional state, ON or OFF, of Sxl, via a few subordinate regulatory genes, controls a switch gene (dsx) that can express two mutually exclusive functions, M or F. These serve to repress either the female or the male set of differentiation genes, thus directing the cells either into the male or into the female sexual pathway. Investigations of control genes and their regulation show that they have properties of homeotic genes. Their role is to select one of two alternative developmental programs. Their function, or lack of function, is required throughout development to maintain the cells in their respective sexual pathway. Differentiation genes are under negative control by dsx. We discuss the cis- and trans-regulatory elements that are needed for sex-, tissue- and stage-specific expression of the differentiation genes. A comparison of Drosophila to other organisms such as Caenorhabditis, mammals and other insects indicates similarities that we interpret as evidence for a basically invariant genetic strategy used by various organisms to regulate sexual development.", "Novel preventive and therapuetic strategy for post-stroke pneumonia.\nPneumonia is a significant complication of ischemic stroke that increases mortality. Post-stroke pneumonia is defined as newly developed pneumonia following stroke onset. Clinically and chronologically, post-stroke pneumonia is divided into two types of aspiration pneumonia. First, acute-onset post-stroke pneumonia occurs within 1 month after stroke. Second, insidious or chronic-onset post-stroke pneumonia occurs 1 month after the stroke. The mechanisms of pneumonia are apparent aspiration and dysphagia-associated microaspiration. Stroke and the post-stroke state are the most significant risk factors for aspiration pneumonia. The preventive and therapeutic strategies have been developed thoroughly and appropriate antibiotic use, and both pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches for the treatment of post-stroke pneumonia have been studied rigorously. Increases in substance P levels, oral care, and swallowing rehabilitation are necessary to improve swallowing function in post-stroke patients, resulting in a reduction in the incidence of post-stroke pneumonia in a chronic stage. The stroke must be a cause of aspiration pneumonia.", "Type A behavior, tension, and ambulatory cardiovascular reactivity in workers exposed to noise stress.\nRecent negative findings regarding differences in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) reactivity at work between Type A and Type B workers may stem from the failure to note the stressors to which they were exposed. In this naturalistic study, an objective work stressor--varying levels of ambient noise--was individually monitored among 123 normotensive males. We examined the relationship of Type A behavior (assessed by the Thurstone Temperament Schedule) to ambulatory BP and HR reactivity under high and low noise conditions. We also tested the hypothesized mediating function of tension arousal. Results of multiple regression analyses indicated that when workers were exposed to high noise levels (> or = 80 dB(A)), Type A behavior was positively related to diastolic BP (p = 0.029) and HR reactivity (p = 0.0001), even after adjusting for clinic values, time of measurement, worker activities, and body position during measurement. When the same workers were exposed to low noise levels, the results were not significant. This suggests that noise constitutes a stressor for Type A individuals, and highlights the importance of noting the actual stressor-exposure condition. In addition, Type A individuals reported high tension, noted concurrently with the ambulatory measurements. Tension arousal was also related to BP and HR reactivity. Adding the tension variable to the above regressions weakened the relationship between Type A behavior and BP and HR reactivity. Thus, the tension experienced by Type A workers exposed to noise stress may have served as a mediator of cardiovascular reactivity.", "Regulation of disease-associated gene expression in the 3D genome.\nGenetic variation associated with disease often appears in non-coding parts of the genome. Understanding the mechanisms by which this phenomenon leads to disease is necessary to translate results from genetic association studies to the clinic. Assigning function to this type of variation is notoriously difficult because the human genome harbours a complex regulatory landscape with a dizzying array of transcriptional regulatory sequences, such as enhancers that have unpredictable, promiscuous and context-dependent behaviour. In this Review, we discuss how technological advances have provided increasingly detailed information on genome folding; for example, genome folding forms loops that bring enhancers and target genes into close proximity. We also now know that enhancers function within topologically associated domains, which are structural and functional units of chromosomes. Studying disease-associated mutations and chromosomal rearrangements in the context of the 3D genome will enable the identification of dysregulated target genes and aid the progression from descriptive genetic association results to discovering molecular mechanisms underlying disease.", "Combination of jaw and tongue movement training influences neuroplasticity of corticomotor pathways in humans.\nSince humans in daily life perform multiple motor behaviors that often involve the simultaneous activation of both jaw and tongue muscles, it is essential to understand the effects of combined orofacial sensorimotor tasks on plasticity in corticomotor pathways. Moreover, to establish novel rehabilitation programs for patients, it is important to clarify the possible interrelationships in corticomotor excitability between jaw and tongue motor control. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a combination of a repetitive tooth bite task (TBT) and a repetitive tongue lift task (TLT) on corticomotor excitability of the tongue and jaw muscles as assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Sixteen healthy individuals participated in three kinds of training tasks consisting of 41-min TBT, 41-min TLT, and 82-min TBT + TLT. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from the tongue muscle, masseter muscle, and first dorsal interosseous muscle were measured before and after the training tasks. The amplitude of tongue MEPs after training with TLT and TLT + TBT, and masseter MEPs after training with TBT and TLT + TBT, were significantly higher than before training (P < 0.05). Tongue MEPs and masseter MEPs were significantly higher after TLT + TBT than after TBT or TLT (P < 0.05). The present results suggest that a task combining both jaw and tongue movement training is associated with a greater degree of neuroplasticity in the corticomotor control of jaw and tongue muscles than either task alone.", "Analysis of the mechanism of ATP stimulation of calf thymus DNA alpha-polymerase.\nBiochemical kinetic analyses of the ATP stimulation of the A2 form of calf DNA alpha-polymerase show that when DNA or primer termini are the variable substrates, maximum reaction velocity is independent of ATP concentration. When dNTP concentration is the variable substrate, the apparent Km is invariant with ATP. Such results indicate that the increase in the synthetic rate caused by ATP results from an improvement in synthesis initiation at primer termini. The effect of ATP on the DNA binding affinity of alpha-A2-polymerase was examined by using column chromatography. Passage of the polymerase through native DNA-cellulose at 70 mM ionic strength resulted in 40% binding of the enzyme. In the presence of 4 mM ATP, binding increased to 80%. In both cases, the bound polymerase could be eluted by a 370 mM ionic strength wash. An elution profile similar to that observed in the absence of ATP was obtained with 0.1 mM ATP, 4 mM GTP, or 4 mM each of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate or adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). These results suggest that hydrolysis of the gamma-phosphate occurs at millimolar levels of ATP and leads to a higher affinity of polymerase for DNA. To distinguish the effects of ATP on RNA priming from those on DNA synthesis, products synthesized processively by alpha-A2-polymerase were sized by gel filtration. Results indicate that essentially all products made on a gapped fd replicative form template in the presence of four dNTPs and 4 mM ATP result from the extension of preexisting DNA primers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "Antiviral and anticancer activities of 13(E)-labd-13-ene-8alpha,15-diol isolated from Brachyglottis monroi.\nThe antiviral activity of 13(E)-labd-13-ene-8alpha,15-diol (1), isolated from Brachyglottis monroi, was examined against human rhinovirus 2 (HRV2) and 3 (HRV3), and the anticancer activity on human cancer cells (A549 and Hep2). Compound (1) showed strong anti-HRV2 and HRV3 activity with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 2.68 and 0.87 microg/mL, respectively, and a 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC(50)) of 59.45 microg/mL. Ribavirin only showed anti-HRV3 activity with an IC(50) of 30.48 microg/mL and a CC(50) > 100 microg/mL. The addition of compound (1) to HRV-infected HeLa cells directly reduced the formation of visible cytopathic effect (CPE) and it directly interacted with HRV particles. Furthermore, A549 and Hep2 cells incubated with 32 microg/mL of compound (1) for 48 h exhibited antilung and antilaryngeal cancer activities, with a viability of less than 50%. These results suggest that compound (1) may be used as a potential antiviral and anticancer agent.", "Immunolocalization of NAD-dependent 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in human kidney and colon.\nThe inactivation of physiological glucocorticoids by 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD) confers mineralocorticoid specificity to certain aldosterone target tissues. Both NADP, and NAD-dependent isoforms of 11 beta-HSD have been described. An NAD-dependent isoform of 11 beta-HSD (11 beta-HSD2) was recently cloned from human kidney. The present studies were designed to examine the cellular distribution of 11 beta-HSD2 in human kidney and colon, and to determine if the cellular distribution of 11 beta-HSD2 within the human kidney and colon is consistent with a role in conferring mineralocorticoid specificity. Using antibodies against a fusion protein containing a portion of the human 11 beta-HSD2, immunohistochemical staining of human kidney showed intense, specific staining of connecting tubules and cortical and medullary collecting tubules and less intense staining in the cortical thick ascending limb. No immunoreactivity was found in proximal tubules, glomeruli, or blood vessels. Within the collecting tubules staining was heterogeneous. The majority of cells showed intense cytoplasmic staining while alpha-intercalated cells displayed much less immunoreactivity. Within the colon, 11 beta-HSD2 immunoreactivity was found predominantly in surface epithelial cells but not in submucosal tissues. Thus, the distribution of the cloned NAD-dependent 11 beta-HSD2 parallels the distribution of mineralocorticoid receptors within the kidney and colon. These results support the view that the NAD-dependent isoform of 11 beta-HSD (11 beta-HSD2) provides mineralocorticoid specificity by inactivating glucocorticoids in an autocrine fashion.", "Growth rates of metastatic brain tumors in nonsmall cell lung cancer.\nThe purpose of the study was to evaluate the growth kinetics of metastatic brain tumors during chemotherapy and to analyze growth rates and volumetric doubling time of metastatic brain tumors in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with tumor regrowth. NSCLC patients with minimally symptomatic brain metastases who were not treated previously were enrolled. Serial magnetic resonance images (MRI) of 30 metastatic brain tumors in 19 patients were reviewed. Tumor growth rates and volumetric tumor doubling time of tumor regrowth were estimated. All patients were treated with front-line chemotherapy until disease progression. The median tumor growth rate was 12.10 mm(3)/day (interquartile range [IQR], 3.09-36.75). The volume percentage increase/day was 1.67 (IQR, 0.69-4.59). The median volumetric tumor doubling time was 58.48 days (IQR, 32.33-98.48). These findings may help optimize patient management during follow-up. Study results indicated that brain MRI should be obtained at a minimum of 2-month intervals to screen for metastatic brain tumors.", "Gene expression profiles of Arabidopsis Cvi seeds during dormancy cycling indicate a common underlying dormancy control mechanism.\nPhysiologically dormant seeds, like those of Arabidopsis, will cycle through dormant states as seasons change until the environment is favourable for seedling establishment. This phenomenon is widespread in the plant kingdom, but has not been studied at the molecular level. Full-genome microarrays were used for a global transcript analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana (accession Cvi) seeds in a range of dormant and dry after-ripened states during cycling. Principal component analysis of the expression patterns observed showed that they differed in newly imbibed primary dormant seeds, as commonly used in experimental studies, compared with those in the maintained primary and secondary dormant states that exist during cycling. Dormant and after-ripened seeds appear to have equally active although distinct gene expression programmes, dormant seeds having greatly reduced gene expression associated with protein synthesis, potentially controlling the completion of germination. A core set of 442 genes were identified that had higher expression in all dormant states compared with after-ripened states. Abscisic acid (ABA) responsive elements were significantly over-represented in this set of genes the expression of which was enhanced when multiple copies of the elements were present. ABA regulation of dormancy was further supported by expression patterns of key genes in ABA synthesis/catabolism, and dormancy loss in the presence of fluridone. The data support an ABA-gibberelic acid hormone balance mechanism controlling cycling through dormant states that depends on synthetic and catabolic pathways of both hormones. Many of the most highly expressed genes in dormant states were stress-related even in the absence of abiotic stress, indicating that ABA, stress and dormancy responses overlap significantly at the transcriptome level.", "Diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease in elderly subjects using 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring.\nTo evaluate the relationship between the parameters of 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) among elderly subjects. Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring was carried out in 20 elderly subjects without apparent GERD symptoms (controls) and 69 suspected GERD subjects. Normal values of the parameters from 20 elderly controls were obtained. Percent of total time, percent of supine time and percent of upright time in which the pH was < 4 (indicating reflux) were less than 3.3%, 1.4%, 5.5%, respectively. The number of reflux episodes and episodes lasting longer than 5 minutes were less than 65 and 2 times respectively. The values obtained in 66 GERD suspected subjects were significantly different from those in normal controls. The differences of reflux parameters between the esophagitis group and non-esophagitis group, such as percent of total time with pH < 4, percent of supine time with pH < 4 and number of reflux lasting longer than 5 minutes were also significant. About 51.6% patients (34/66) with reflux symptoms but without endoscopic evidence of esophagitis were definitely diagnosed as GERD by esophageal pH monitoring. Duration of esophageal acid exposure correlated with the severity of GERD.", "Successful management of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type I in pregnancy.\nWe report the successful management of a pregnancy with preexisting nephrotic syndrome due to biopsy-proven primary membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type I. A 21-year-old Turkish woman with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type I was followed up by the obstetrics and gynecology, and nephrology departments of a university hospital throughout her pregnancy starting from the 25th week of gestation. Due to progression of intrauterine growth retardation and fetal distress, a cesarean section was performed in the 33rd week of gestation. Although creatinine was unchanged, proteinuria increased with relatively stable albumin levels 3 months after delivery and her treatment was adjusted accordingly. If the mother is not suffering from hypertension or renal insufficiency, specific therapy for membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type I during pregnancy provided by a nephrologist together with regular obstetric care may allow the patient to have a viable fetus, which might be growth retarded if proteinuria is increased.", "[Dumbbell-shaped double-leaf flap for the repair of penetrating wound of palm with tissue defect].\nThe penetrating wound of palm with the defect of tissues was usually caused by blunt crushing of gun-shot injury. It was difficult to treat clinically. In order to repair the skin defect of palm and dorsum in one operation, 2 kinds of dumbbell-shaped double-leaf flap were desigened. From February 1993 to March 1996, 5 cases with penetrating wound of palm were treated by this method in which the interosseous posterior artery flap in 4, and the superficial epigastric flap in 1. There were 4 males and 1 female with the ages ranging from 15 to 47 years old. The results were as follows: total survival of the flap in 4 cases and partial necrosis of skin margin of the distal leaf in 1 case. The appearance and function of the flap were satisfactory after a follow-up from 4 months to 3 years. It was concluded that the interosseous posterior artery flap had a long vascular pedicle with its constant anatomical distribution, and the 2nd stage of division of the pedicle of the flap was not necessary. It was a perfect flap in repairing the penetrating wound of the palm with small skin defect. The superficial epigastric flap was cumbersome in appearance and was necessary to divide the pedicle of the flap in 2nd staged operation. It was suitable in repairing the penetrating wound with large skin defect. Regarding the operative technique, a meticulous debridement and the appropriate flap area were required, and the blood vessel of the flap should not be compressed by the surrounding tissues. The advantages of this operation provided a simple method to handle, high rate of survival, and one-staged operation.", "Structures and rearrangement reactions of 4-aminophenol(H2O)1+ and 3-aminophenol(H2O)1+ clusters.\nIn this paper the structures of 4-aminophenol(H2O)1+ and 3-aminophenol(H2O)1+ clusters are investigated in molecular beam experiments by different IR/UV-double resonance techniques as well as the mass analyzed threshold ionization spectroscopy yielding both inter- and intramolecular vibrations of the ionic and neutral species. Possible structures are extensively calculated at the level of density functional theory (DFT) or at the ab initio level of theory. From the experimental and theoretical investigations it can be concluded that in the case of 4-aminophenol(H2O)1 one O-H...O hydrogen-bonded structure exists in the neutral cluster but two structures containing either an O-H...O or a N-H...O hydrogen-bonded arrangement are observed in the spectra of the ionic species. This observation is a result of an intramolecular rearrangement reaction within the ion which can only take place if high excess energies are used. A reaction path via the CH bonds is calculated and explains the experimental observations. In the case of 3-aminophenol(H2O)1+ only one O-H...O bound structure is observed both in the neutral and ionic species. Ab initio and DFT calculations show that due to geometrical and energetical reasons a rearrangement cannot be observed in the 3-aminophenol(H2O)1+ cluster ion.", "Predictors of HIV-related risk behaviors among heterosexuals in alcoholism treatment.\nTo determine which measures of alcohol and drug use are associated with HIV-related sexual risk and protective behaviors. Entrants (N = 743, 72% male) to alcoholism treatment clinics underwent a structured interview including an assessment of demographics, substance abuse characteristics and sexual behaviors. Associations were examined between alcohol- and drug-related behaviors, and demographic variables, with the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviors. Those more likely to use alcohol or drugs when having sex, and those who expect to have high-risk sex when they drink alcohol, were more likely to engage in high-risk sexual behavior. Measures of severity of alcohol or drug problems alone were not consistently related to high-risk or protective behaviors. Several other concurrently used measures (such as the Addition Severity Index and alcohol expectancies) showed more consistent association with high-risk behaviors. There was no apparent reduction in the likelihood of practicing risk-reducing behaviors among those more severely addicted and those who combined alcohol and/or drugs with sex. This study suggests that sexual risk and protective behaviors are not consistently associated with severity of addiction problems. Some measures of alcohol and drug use (i.e., the ASI Drug Composite Score and the Enhanced Risk subscale of the alcohol expectancy measure) were more consistently related to the specific risk behaviors measured than were others (e.g., the ASI Alcohol Composite Score), while most measures showed little or no association with protective behaviors.", "Evaluating the preoperative breast cancer characteristics affecting the accuracy of axillary ultrasound staging.\nWe evaluate the preoperative breast cancer (BC) characteristics that affect the diagnostic accuracy of axillary ultrasound (US) and determine the reliability of US in the different subgroups of BC patients. Axillary US assessments in women with invasive BC diagnosed between 2009 and 2016 in a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. The diagnostic accuracy of axillary US was obtained using surgical nodal histology as the gold standard. Preoperative breast tumor sonographic and histological factors affecting axillary US diagnostic accuracy were examined. Of the 605 newly diagnosed invasive BC cases reviewed, 251 (41.5%) had nodal metastases. Axillary US sensitivity was 75.7%, specificity 92.9%, positive predictive value 88.4%, negative predictive value 84.4%, and false-negative rate 24.3%. Lower US sensitivity was seen with invasive lobular cancer (ILC) (P = .043), grade I/II, (P = .021), unifocal (P = .039), and smaller tumors (P < .001). US specificity was lower in grade III (P < .001), estrogen receptor (ER)-negative (P < .001), progesterone receptor (PR)-negative (P = .004), HER2-positive (P = .015), triple-negative (P = .001), and larger breast tumors (P < .001). US has moderate sensitivity and good specificity in detecting metastatic axillary lymph nodes. Based on preoperative cancer characteristics, US was less sensitive for nodal metastases from ILC, unifocal, lower grade, and smaller breast tumors. It was also less specific in grade III, ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2-positive, triple-negative, and larger breast tumors. Caution is suggested in interpreting the US axillary findings of patients with these preoperative tumor features.", "In search of a good death: observations of patients, families, and providers.\nDespite a recent increase in the attention given to improving end-of-life care, our understanding of what constitutes a good death is surprisingly lacking. The purpose of this study was to gather descriptions of the components of a good death from patients, families, and providers through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. Seventy-five participants-including physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, hospice volunteers, patients, and recently bereaved family members-were recruited from a university medical center, a Veterans Affairs medical center, and a community hospice. Participants identified six major components of a good death: pain and symptom management, clear decision making, preparation for death, completion, contributing to others, and affirmation of the whole person. The six themes are process-oriented attributes of a good death, and each has biomedical, psychological, social, and spiritual components. Physicians' discussions of a good death differed greatly from those of other groups. Physicians offered the most biomedical perspective, and patients, families, and other health care professionals defined a broad range of attributes integral to the quality of dying. Although there is no \"right\" way to die, these six themes may be used as a framework for understanding what participants tend to value at the end of life. Biomedical care is critical, but it is only a point of departure toward total end-of-life care. For patients and families, psychosocial and spiritual issues are as important as physiologic concerns.", "[Epidemiology of COPD in France].\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a frequent and disabling disease but epidemiologic data remain fragmentary. The objective of this work was to bring together and describe the French epidemiologic data about COPD. This review of the literature was performed by querying the NLM PubMed database in French and in English with the key words \"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\", \"epidemiology\", \"mortality\", and \"France\". The studies including French data were selected. Four prevalence studies and one mortality study were identified. Prevalence was estimated between 1.0 and 11.1% in the general population. The mean mortality rate between 2000 and 2002 was 84.3/100,000 in men and 19.1/100,000 in women. Smoking is the best documented risk factor and a dose-response relationship has been established. The attributable risk fraction for occupational exposure is assessed at 15 to 20%. Prevalence studies are rare and do not always include objective measures of respiratory function. There are no specific French data in populations of smokers. COPD is a major public health issue. The main risk factor is smoking but the risk fraction attributable to occupational exposure is substantial. Epidemiologic knowledge of COPD should advance as the results of studies and screening program for at-risk subjects currently underway as part of the national COPD plan become available.", "Growth-stimulating effect of dienogest, a synthetic steroid, on rodent, canine, and primate mammary glands.\nWe observed hyperplasia of the mammary gland in female beagle dogs, but not in female rats and monkeys, in 91-day toxicity studies on dienogest. In order to elucidate a possible mechanism for its development and to account for this species difference, we determined the plasma level of growth hormone (GH) in dogs, rats, and monkeys treated orally with dienogest for 91 days. As a result, dogs with mammary hyperplasia showed a prominent, dose-dependent increase in their GH level; and, contrarily, rats and monkeys without the hyperplasia of this organ failed to show any such increase. These results were supported by evidence from immunohistochemical and morphometric analysis of the pituitary gland. In addition, dienogest and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) stimulated the growth of canine mammary epithelial cells in the presence of estradiol in vitro, but had no effect on rat and human mammary epithelial cells incubated under the same conditions. In conclusion, dienogest with progestational activity caused proliferation of the mammary gland in beagle dogs by increasing the secretion of GH, as do other progestational compounds. This change may be partially dependent on the direct effect of the drug.", "Length grading machines, or grain separators, are typically used to separate a stream of grain containing various types and sizes of grain into its constituent parts, for example, wheat, durum, oats, barley and rice, and/or to separate such grains from other seed contaminants. These machines employ a rotating member, or cylinder, having lifting pockets located along an interior surface thereof, for example, formed by indentations; the pockets, according to their size, receive and lift particular lengths, or sizes of granules out of a stream of grain having been fed into the cylinder as the cylinder rotates. A trough, called a liftings trough, is mounted within the cylinder, to receive the separated granules, which are lifted by the lifting pockets; the trough may include a conveyor, for example, a screw conveyor, to transport the separated granules out from the machine.\nIn existing length grading machines, lifting troughs have been made larger to handle an increased amount of lifted granules in order to increase separation process efficiency. However, such an enlarged liftings trough, rather than providing the desired increased efficiency, can, by restricting the flow of granules entering the rotating cylinder, cause inlet leakage and pinching that results in a reduced efficiency.", "Glucotoxicity and beta-cell failure in type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nType 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide with a trend of declining age of onset. It is characterized by insulin resistance and a progressive loss of beta-cell function. The ability to secrete adequate amounts of insulin is determined by the functional integrity of beta-cells and their overall mass. Glucose, the main regulator of insulin secretion and production, exerts negative effects on beta-cell function when present in excessive amounts over a prolonged period. The multiple metabolic aberrations induced by chronic hyperglycemia in the beta-cell include increased sensitivity to glucose, increased basal insulin release, reduced response to stimulus to secrete insulin, and a gradual depletion of insulin stores. Inadequate insulin production during chronic hyperglycemia results from decreased insulin gene transcription due to hyperglycemia-induced changes in the activity of beta-cell specific transcription factors. Hyperglycemia may negatively affect beta-cell mass by inducing apoptosis without a compensatory increase in beta-cell proliferation and neogenesis. The detrimental effect of excessive glucose concentrations is referred to as 'glucotoxicity'. The present review discusses the role of glucotoxicity in beta-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus.", "Home Screening Questionnaire: its validity in assessing home environment.\nTo develop a quick, practical tool to identify home environments likely to be suboptimal for the development of children, we adapted segments of the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Inventory, which assesses the environments of children from birth to 6 years, and devised the Home Screening Questionnaire (HSQ). Whereas the HOME Inventory requires a home visit, the HSQ consists of two forms, one for children from birth to 3 years, another for 3 to 6 years, that are completed by parents without a home visit. The questions are formulated at the third to sixth grade reading level and can be completed in 15 to 20 minutes. Scoring and interpretation by a professional takes 5 minutes. HSQ questions were answered by more than 1500 parents of low-income families. Between 81% and 86% of the environments determined to be of concern by the HOME Inventory were identified by the briefer and less expensive HSQ. Thus the HSQ readily lends itself to use by health care providers who serve low-income families.", "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has recently emerged as a new human disease with a mortality rate as high as 15%. The genome of the putative etiological agent, SARS-associated coronavirus (SCV), contains a spike glycoprotein that is implicated in viral attachment and entry by homology to similar proteins in related coronaviruses. These spike glycoproteins contain two regions of hydrophobic heptad repeat sequences characteristic of the viral trimer-of-hairpins structural motif. Formation of a trimer-of-hairpins is an essential step in the membrane fusion process of other enveloped viruses, including HIV-1, Ebola virus and respiratory syncytial virus. Moreover, for these unrelated viruses, polypeptides and small molecules that disrupt the formation of this crucial structure are potent inhibitors of viral infectivity. The studies proposed here test the trimer-of-hairpins structural hypothesis for SCV and develop membrane fusion assays to test possible inhibitors of SCV spike glycoprotein. The specific aims are: 1) To generate and biophysically characterize polypeptides derived from the heptad repeat regions of SCV spike glycoprotein, and to solve the structure of particularly stable constructs using x-ray crystallography; and 2) To develop a cell-cell fusion assay and/or a pseudoviral infectivity assay to assess the fusion activity of the SCV spike glycoprotein, and to test polypeptides derived from the heptad repeat regions for potential inhibitory activity. These experiments will explore the structure and function of the SCV spike glycoprotein, essential information for the future development of antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.", "China's bullying over Taiwan reaches beyond its borders, from conferences to a sport event that celebrates sexual and gender diversity, which, ironically, was once \"silenced\" on the authoritarian regime's highly-controlled Internet and social media earlier this year. The Gay Games 2018 is going to take place in Paris from August 4 to 12, and will welcome 650 teams from 91 countries. Taiwan is expected to send 18 teams to compete. In a screenshot image taken on July 26 from the webpage that showcases the numbers of participating teams and the name of the countries they represent, the reference to Taiwan is missing, and is replaced by the city name of Taipei. The rest are sporting names of their countries. It is the second bullying incident in just a week in the field of sports, following the stripping of the city of Taichung's right to host the 2019 East Asian Youth Gamesunder Beijing's influence.", "Interplay of Intermolecular and Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds on Complex Formation: The 3-Aminopropanol-Water van der Waals Complex.\nThis combined experimental and theoretical study answers the question whether the intramolecular hydrogen-bond strength in amino alcohols is dependent on the ring size. For this purpose, the rotational spectrum of the 3-aminopropanol-H2O van der Waals complex was recorded using Fourier-transform microwave spectroscopy and fit to the rotational, quadrupole coupling, and centrifugal distortion constants of the Watson A-reduction Hamiltonian. The experimental results are consistent with an ab initio conformation calculated at the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level that involves the lowest energy 3-aminopropanol monomer and consists of a hydrogen bonding network. The calculated global minimum ab initio complex however comprises a higher energy monomer conformation of 3-aminopropanol. Upon complex formation with water, the O-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N intramolecular hydrogen bond and OCCN backbone conformation of the lower energy monomer remain unchanged, in contrast to 2-aminoethanol. This behavior is consistent with the increasing strength of the intramolecular hydrogen bond of linear amino alcohols as a function of increasing chain length.", "Gene expression analysis of human renal biopsies: recent developments towards molecular diagnosis of kidney disease.\nThe analysis of renal tissue from kidney biopsies by histology, electron microscopy and immunohistology represents the current standards used to establish a specific diagnosis in nephrology. Recent progress in gene expression-based tissue analysis may provide fundamentally novel information in renal biopsy interpretation. In this review, progress towards the routine application of this approach is summarized. Renal disease is characterized by closely interrelated mechanisms of inflammation, repair, scarring and atrophy affecting over 20 different intrinsic renal cell types. The renal biopsy sample represents a 'snapshot' of these dynamic processes. A central question for molecular diagnosis is whether specific gene expression patterns can adequately define segments of these disease processes. Can molecular markers be extracted as effectively as has been shown in oncology? Several studies have been able to correlate renal gene expression patterns with clinical parameters, renal histological findings and patient follow-up data. In small populations, molecular markers have been able to provide novel diagnostic, prognostic and differential therapeutic information beyond conventional histology. A growing number of renal gene expression projects are generating targets for the integration of molecular approaches into kidney biopsy evaluation. If these molecular makers can pass rigorous testing for their diagnostic value, they should become an indispensable part of the management of the renal patient.", "NF-\u03baB activation in organs from STZ-treated rats.\nNuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor comprised of various subunits (p50 (NF-\u03baB1), p52 (NF-\u03baB2), p65 (RelA), RelB, and c-Rel). Activation of certain NF-\u03baB subunits appears to foster an inflammatory state that may promote the development of disease. Thus characterizing the specific NF-\u03baB subunits may provide insight into the pathogenesis of certain diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine if 1 month of a diabetic state, induced by streptozotocin (STZ) treatment, alters the constitutive level of NF-\u03baB activation, its subunit composition, or the content of NF-\u03baB-related proteins in rodent liver, kidney, spleen, and heart. Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by a single tail vein injection of STZ (55 mg\u00b7kg-1 body weight). After 30 days, the heart, liver, spleen, and kidney were assessed for NF-\u03baB activation and subunit composition with electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and p50 and p65 subunit content was assessed with Western blotting. In diabetic animals, the constitutive level of NF-\u03baB activation was reduced in liver, but was unchanged in kidney, spleen, and heart. EMSA supershifts showed the predominant subunit in the activated NF-\u03baB complexes from both diabetic and control animals to be p50, although the p65 subunit was detected in NF-\u03baB complexes from diabetic hearts. The content of p50 was unaltered in all diabetic tissues examined, whereas the content of p65 was increased only in hearts from diabetic animals. These findings support the idea that a diabetic state may induce specific changes in NF-\u03baB subunit composition in certain tissues.", "Optimization of bone growth and remodeling in response to loading in tapered mammalian limbs.\nHow bones respond dynamically to mechanical loading through changes in shape and structure is poorly understood, particularly with respect to variations between bones. Structurally, cortical bones adapt in vivo to their mechanical environments primarily by modulating two processes, modeling and Haversian remodeling. Modeling, defined here as the addition of new bone, may occur in response to mechanical stimuli by altering bone shape or size through growth. Haversian remodeling is thought to be an adaptation to repair microcracks or prevent microcrack propagation. Here, we examine whether cortical bone in sheep limbs modulates periosteal modeling and Haversian remodeling to optimize strength relative to mass in hind-limb midshafts in response to moderate levels of exercise at different growth stages. Histomorphometry was used to compare rates of periosteal growth and Haversian remodeling in exercised and sedentary treatment groups of juvenile, subadult and young adult sheep. In vivo strain data were also collected for the tibia and metatarsal midshafts of juvenile sheep. The results suggest that limb bones initially optimize responses to loading according to the varying power requirements associated with adding mass at different locations. In juveniles, exercise induces higher rates of periosteal modeling in proximal midshafts and higher rates of Haversian remodeling in distal midshafts. Consequently, distal element midshafts experience higher strains and, presumably, have lower safety factors. As animals age, periosteal modeling rates decline and Haversian remodeling rates increase, but moderate levels of mechanical loading stimulate neither process significantly.", "Continuous and simultaneous on-line measurements of VO2 and VCO2 during endotracheal anesthesia.\nA single method was developed for the continuous measurement of oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) during endotracheal anesthesia. The total vented flow from a Bain circuit was measured during anesthesia in 28 adult patients and was found to attain at least 97% of a 6-L/min fresh gas inflow (FGI). Therefore, the circuit overflow was assumed to approximate the FGI. Total volume of vented oxygen was calculated by multiplying FGI by oxygen concentration in the vented (mixed expired) gas. VO2 was assessed as the difference between the oxygen volumes entering and leaving the circuit. VCO2 was derived from the product of FGI and mixed expired CO2 concentration. VO2 measured on the Bain circuit correlated with measurements made on a non-breathing circuit (n = 60 pairs, r = 0.99). A good correlation was also found between VCO2 obtained on both circuits (n = 60 pairs, r = 0.99).", "Isolation and characterization of an arginine ester hydrolase from Bothrops jararacussu venom which induces contractions of the isolated rat uterus.\nThe isolation and partial characterization of a serine protease with arginine ester hydrolase activity from Bothrops jararacussu snake venom are described. The purification procedure consisted of a gel filtration of the crude venom on Sephadex G-75 followed by an ion-exchange chromatography of the active fraction on DEAE-cellulose and a rechromatography on Bio-Rex 70 resin. The esterase fraction (DI-III), M(r) = 25,000 by SDS-PAGE, showed proteolytic activity on fibrinogen and casein. After 2 hr incubation, the A alpha and B beta chains of fibrinogen were intensely hydrolysed, while the gamma chain kept apparently intact, even after 20 hr of incubation. In spite of that, DI-III did not clot fibrinogen. DI-III induced edema in the rat paw. Although unable to release bradykinin, it induced contractions of the isolated rat uterus. DI-III did not catalyse the hydrolysis of bradykinin. Its arginine ester hydrolase activity was completely inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate after 1 hr incubation, but not by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride under the same conditions.", "[Radiological diagnostics of pediatric lungs].\nPediatric lung diseases are a common clinical problem. Besides the clinical examination and laboratory tests, imaging studies are the mainstay in the diagnostics of pediatric lung diseases. Thorough consideration of radiation protection based on optimized equipment also includes the protection of relatives and medical staff. The high impact of radiation protection in children necessitates a different choice of imaging modalities compared to adults. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as adjunct or complementary imaging methods are of greater value than computed tomography (CT). The suspicion of pneumonia is the most common reason for chest imaging examinations in children. An anteroposterior or posteroanterior view chest X-ray is sufficient in most cases and sometimes in combination with ultrasound. The latter can also be used alone for follow-up examinations if the clinical presentation does not change. Additionally, ultrasound is applied to examine unclear structures seen on chest X-rays, such as the thymus or pulmonary sequestration in adjunct with color-coded duplex sonography. A chest X-ray is also the method of choice to examine the various forms of respiratory distress syndrome, such as wet lung disease or surfactant deficiency syndrome in newborns. Fluoroscopy is used in older children with suspected ingestion and/or aspiration of foreign bodies and CT is mostly used for staging and follow-up of thoracic and pulmonary structures in pediatric oncology. Recent technical advances, e.g. iterative reconstruction, have dramatically reduced the CT dosage. Apart from some indications (e.g. tumors and sequestration) MRI is rarely used in children; however, its potential for functional analyses (e.g. perfusion and ventilation) may increase the application in the near future.", "Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor from wild rice (OrbHLH2) improves tolerance to salt- and osmotic stress in Arabidopsis.\nSalt stress adversely affects plant growth and development. Some plants reduce the damage of high-salt stress by expressing a series of salt-responsive genes. Studies of the molecular mechanism of the salt-stress response have focused on the characterization of components involved in signal perception and transduction. In the present work, we cloned and characterized a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) encoding gene, OrbHLH2, from wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), which encodes a homologue protein of ICE1 in Arabidopsis. OrbHLH2 protein localized in the nucleus. Overexpression of OrbHLH2 in Arabidopsis conferred increased tolerance to salt and osmotic stress, and the stress-responsive genes DREB1A/CBF3, RD29A, COR15A and KIN1 were upregulated in transgenic plants. Abscisic acid (ABA) treatment showed a similar effect on the seed germination or transcriptional expression of stress-responsive genes in both wild type and OrbHLH2-overexpressed plants, which implies that OrbHLH2 does not depend on ABA in responding to salt stress. OrbHLH2 may function as a transcription factor and positively regulate salt-stress signals independent of ABA in Arabidopsis, which provides some useful data for improving salt tolerance in crops.", "Iliac crest bone graft. Osteotome versus saw.\nThe strength of saw-harvested vs. osteotome-harvested Smith-Robinson iliac crest grafts from five fresh frozen cadavers was compared. Matched pairs of grafts were harvested, one with a saw and the other with an osteotome from equivalent locations on the two iliac crests of each pelvis. Grafts were tested to failure in axial compression, and load-displacement curves were recorded for each test. Yield load and displacement, ultimate load, and stiffness were calculated, and statistical analysis was performed with the Student t test and three-way analysis of variance. Evaluation of the 66 pairs of grafts revealed that saw-harvested grafts were consistently stronger than were matched grafts harvested with an osteotome. The middle third of the iliac crest produced significantly stronger grafts, and those harvested from younger donors were significantly stronger than those obtained from older donors. Of even greater clinical relevance, saw-harvested grafts were stiffer than osteotome-harvested grafts. Based on these findings, it is recommended that iliac crest grafts harvested for spine fusion be obtained with an oscillating saw rather than with an osteotome.", "Spectrophotometric flow injection determination of dissolved titanium in seawater exploiting in-line nitrilotriacetic acid resin preconcentration and a long path length liquid waveguide capillary cell.\nA sensitive spectrophotometric method for the determination of dissolved titanium (Ti) in seawater is developed. It involves in-line preconcentration and a long path length liquid waveguide capillary cell (LWCC). Nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) resin is used to preconcentrate Ti from \u223c25 mL seawater sample at pH 1.7, and elution is accomplished with 0.8 mol L-1 hydrochloride acid. The eluted Ti solution is buffered to pH 6.0 with 1.0 mol L-1 ammonium acetate and mixed with 1.5 mmol L-1 Tiron solution. The mixture is then injected into LWCC and measured by spectrophotometry at 420 nm. Before the preconcentration step, the sample is treated with 7 mmol L-1 ascorbic acid to reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II), in order to eliminate the Fe interference. The method is not interfered by Fe(III) and Cu(II) present in seawater samples at concentrations 50-fold higher in relation to Ti, and by Cd(II), Pb(II), Cr(VI), Mn(II), Al(III), Zn(II), and Ni(II) at concentrations 100-fold higher in relation to Ti. It is time efficient (7.5 minutes per sample), sensitive (0.10 nmol L-1 detection limit), precise (1.40% measurement RSD at 1.00 nmol L-1 Ti) and is characterized by a linear range of 0.50-5.00 nmol L-1 Ti. The method was applied to analysis of natural water samples collected from the Jiulongjiang Estuary, Fujian, China.", "Reproduction of nearby sources by imposing true interaural differences on a sound field control approach.\nIn anechoic conditions, the Interaural Level Difference (ILD) is the most significant auditory cue to judge the distance to a sound source located within 1 m of the listener's head. This is due to the unique characteristics of a point source in its near field, which result in exceptionally high, distance dependent ILDs. When reproducing the sound field of sources located near the head with line or circular arrays of loudspeakers, the reproduced ILDs are generally lower than expected, due to physical limitations. This study presents an approach that combines a sound field reproduction method, known as Pressure Matching (PM), and a binaural control technique. While PM aims at reproducing the incident sound field, the objective of the binaural control technique is to ensure a correct reproduction of interaural differences. The combination of these two approaches gives rise to the following features: (i) an accurate reproduction of ILDs is achieved at the head positions considered by the method, (ii) the ILD variations in the vicinity of those positions are smoothed, thus lowering the ILD error, and (iii) the true wavefront is preserved. Given the properties of the presented method, intended distance and directional perception is expected.", "Transmen in San Francisco: what do we know from HIV test site data?\nThe HIV epidemic has disproportionately affected marginalized populations. Societal marginalization contributes to the lack of appropriate prevention programs focusing on these populations, which in turn may contribute to ongoing HIV transmission. Transmen (female-to-male transgender persons) may also be a marginalized population at risk for HIV infection. Unfortunately, few studies that focus on transmen have been conducted. We considered the available existing data sources that may include members of the transmen population in San Francisco to describe what is known and what remains to be understood with respect to their risk for HIV. Data used for this descriptive analysis were collected at HIV test sites in 2009. In 2009, 59 unduplicated test seekers identified as transmen. While behavioral risk factors present in this study point to the high potential for HIV risk, there may still be low HIV prevalence and time to intervene. Lest we be caught off guard as another marginalized sexual minority experiences the tragedy of a rapid HIV epidemic, more detailed, specifically designed studies are needed to complete what we do not know about this population.", "Differential effects of hypophysectomy upon analgesia induced by two glucoprivic stressors and morphine.\nPain threshold elevations induced in rats following acute exposure to stressful cold-water swims and to inescapable foot shocks are significantly attenuated by hypophysectomy. The present study investigated the effects of hypophysectomy upon the dose-dependent and time-dependent analgesia induced by morphine and by the glucoprivic agents, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) and insulin. Two reflex pain tests, the tail-pinch and the flinch-jump were employed. In normal rats, insulin induced prolonged (180 min) analgesia at doses of 16 U/kg on the tail-pinch test and 256 U/kg on the flinch-jump test. However, the same agents induced small and brief pain threshold elevations in hypophysectomized animals. By contrast, though 2-DG increased both measures in both groups, its effects were more marked in hypophysectomized rats. Hypophysectomized rats also exhibited a potentiated analgesic effect on both tests following high doses of morphine. On the other hand, low doses of morphine transiently increased tail-pinch thresholds in normal, but not hypophysectomized subjects. These data provide further evidence of multiple pain-inhibitory mechanisms in which the pituitary plays a complex, but integral part.", "Capillary electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and UV-visible absorption studies on electrolyte-induced fractionation of gold nanoclusters.\nWe describe a novel and simple electrolyte-induced fractionation method to separate a polydisperse water-soluble gold nanocluster (Au NC) product. Different particle sizes of Au NC fractions can be easily centrifuged down as a function of the electrolyte concentration or lipophilicity of the solution. The changes in the absorption characteristic of the Au NC fractions under different electrolyte/ethanol conditions demonstrate the change in particle size distribution of the Au NC. Small gold nanoclusters, Au10, Au11, Au12, and Au15, were separated from the Au10-Au50 polydisperse Au NC product under various phosphate/ethanol conditions. The core size separation of Au NC was evaluated by their migration trends in capillary zone electrophoresis, UV-visible absorption, and mass spectra. The electrolyte-induced fractionation not only provides a convenient method to separate small Au NC mixture but also assists in the study of the photophysical properties of smaller Au NCs that are present with the larger Au NCs in a polydisperse Au NC product.", "Cell wall-related genes studies on peach cultivars with differential susceptibility to woolliness: looking for candidates as indicators of chilling tolerance.\nThe results obtained indicate that a \u03b2-xylosidase gene may act as good indicator of chilling tolerance and provide new insights into the complex issue of peach fruit woolliness. The storage of peaches at low temperatures for prolonged periods can induce a form of chilling injury (CI) called woolliness, characterized by a lack of juiciness and a mealy texture. As this disorder has been associated with abnormal cell wall dismantling, the levels of 12 transcripts encoding proteins involved in cell wall metabolism were analysed in cultivars with contrasting susceptibility to this disorder selected from five melting flesh peach cultivars. The resistant ('Springlady') and susceptible ('Flordaking') cultivars displayed differences in the level of expression of some of the selected genes during fruit softening and in woolly versus non-woolly fruits. From these genes, the level of expression of PpXyl, which encodes for a putative \u03b2-xylosidase, was the one that presented the highest correlation (negative) with the susceptibility to woolliness. PpXyl expression was also analysed in a cultivar ('Rojo 2') with intermediate susceptibility to woolliness, reinforcing the conclusion about the correlation of PpXyl expression to the presence of woolliness symptom. Moreover, the level of expression of PpXyl correlated to protein level detected by Western blot. Analyses of the promoter region of the PpXyl gene (1637 bp) isolated from the three cultivars showed no differences suggesting that cis-elements from other regions of the genome and/or trans elements could be responsible of the differential PpXyl expression patterns. Overall, the results obtained indicate that PpXyl may act as a good indicator of woolliness tolerance and that the regulation of expression of this gene in different cultivars does not depend on sequences upstream the coding sequence.", "Phenotyping of subjects for large scale studies on patients with IBS.\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a complex condition with multiple factors contributing to its aetiology and pathophysiology. Aetiologically these include genetics, life-time events and environment, and physiologically, changes in motility, central processing, visceral sensitivity, immunity, epithelial permeability and gastrointestinal microflora. Such complexity means there is currently no specific reliable biomarker for IBS, and thus IBS continues to be diagnosed and classified according to symptom based criteria, the Rome Criteria. Carefully phenotyping and characterisation of a 'large' pool of IBS patients across Europe and even the world however, might help identify sub-populations with accuracy and consistency. This will not only aid future research but improve tailoring of treatment and health care of IBS patients. The aim of this position paper is to discuss the requirements necessary to standardize the process of selecting and phenotyping IBS patients and how to organise the collection and storage of patient information/samples in such a large multi-centre pan European/global study. We include information on general demographics, gastrointestinal symptom assessment, psychological factors, quality of life, physiological evaluation, genetic/epigenetic and microbiota analysis, biopsy/blood sampling, together with discussion on the organisational, ethical and language issues associated with implementing such a study. The proposed approach and documents selected to be used in such a study was the result of a thoughtful and thorough four-year dialogue amongst experts associated with the European COST action BM1106 GENIEUR (www.GENIEUR.eu).", "Medication continuation and compliance: a comparison of patients treated with clozapine and haloperidol.\nThis study compares medication continuation and regimen compliance with the atypical antipsychotic medication clozapine versus the conventional antipsychotic haloperidol. Data from a 15-site double-blind, randomized clinical trial (N = 423) were used to compare patients with DSM-III-R schizophrenia assigned to clozapine or haloperidol in terms of duration of participation while taking the randomly assigned study drug (continuation) and the proportion of prescribed pills that were taken (compliance). Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the relationship of baseline characteristics and measures of clinical change to continuation for the entire sample and for patients assigned to each medication. Patients assigned to clozapine continued taking the study drug for a mean of 35.5 weeks as compared with only 27.2 among patients assigned to haloperidol (F = 4.45, df = 1,422; p = .0001). No differences were found between the groups in the proportion of prescribed pills that were returned at any timepoint. Among patients assigned to haloperidol, poorer continuation was associated with being older and greater continuation with receiving public support. Among patients on clozapine treatment, continuation was poorer among African American patients and greater among patients who showed reduced clinical symptoms and akathisia. Continuation with clozapine was greater even after adjusting for these factors. Continuation with medication is greater with clozapine than haloperidol and is partly explained by greater symptom improvement and reduced side effects. No differences were found in regimen compliance.", "Putting Co-Exposures on Equal Footing: An Ecological Analysis of Same-Scale Measures of Air Pollution and Social Factors on Cardiovascular Disease in New York City.\nEpidemiologic evidence consistently links urban air pollution exposures to health, even after adjustment for potential spatial confounding by socioeconomic position (SEP), given concerns that air pollution sources may be clustered in and around lower-SEP communities. SEP, however, is often measured with less spatial and temporal resolution than are air pollution exposures (i.e., census-tract socio-demographics vs. fine-scale spatio-temporal air pollution models). Although many questions remain regarding the most appropriate, meaningful scales for the measurement and evaluation of each type of exposure, we aimed to compare associations for multiple air pollutants and social factors against cardiovascular disease (CVD) event rates, with each exposure measured at equal spatial and temporal resolution. We found that, in multivariable census-tract-level models including both types of exposures, most pollutant-CVD associations were non-significant, while most social factors retained significance. Similarly, the magnitude of association was higher for an IQR-range difference in the social factors than in pollutant concentrations. We found that when offered equal spatial and temporal resolution, CVD was more strongly associated with social factors than with air pollutant exposures in census-tract-level analyses in New York City.", "NeuronRead, an open source semi-automated tool for morphometric analysis of phase contrast and fluorescence neuronal images.\nNeurons are specialized cells of the Central Nervous System whose function is intricately related to the neuritic network they develop to transmit information. Morphological evaluation of this network and other neuronal structures is required to establish relationships between neuronal morphology and function, and may allow monitoring physiological and pathophysiologic alterations. Fluorescence-based microphotographs are the most widely used in cellular bioimaging, but phase contrast (PhC) microphotographs are easier to obtain, more affordable, and do not require invasive, complicated and disruptive techniques. Despite the various freeware tools available for fluorescence-based images analysis, few exist that can tackle the more elusive and harder-to-analyze PhC images. To surpass this, an interactive semi-automated image processing workflow was developed to easily extract relevant information (e.g. total neuritic length, average cell body area) from both PhC and fluorescence neuronal images. This workflow, named 'NeuronRead', was developed in the form of an ImageJ macro. Its robustness and adaptability were tested and validated on rat cortical primary neurons under control and differentiation inhibitory conditions. Validation included a comparison to manual determinations and to a golden standard freeware tool for fluorescence image analysis. NeuronRead was subsequently applied to PhC images of neurons at distinct differentiation days and exposed or not to DAPT, a pharmacological inhibitor of the \u03b3-secretase enzyme, which cleaves the well-known Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the Notch receptor. Data obtained confirms a neuritogenic regulatory role for \u03b3-secretase products and validates NeuronRead as a time- and cost-effective useful monitoring tool.", "Development and validation of a new technique for estimating a minimum postmortem interval using adult blow fly (Diptera: Calliphoridae) carcass attendance.\nUnderstanding the onset and duration of adult blow fly activity is critical to accurately estimating the period of insect activity or minimum postmortem interval (minPMI). Few, if any, reliable techniques have been developed and consequently validated for using adult fly activity to determine a minPMI. In this study, adult blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) of Cochliomyia macellaria and Chrysomya rufifacies were collected from swine carcasses in rural central Texas, USA, during summer 2008 and Phormia regina and Calliphora vicina in the winter during 2009 and 2010. Carcass attendance patterns of blow flies were related to species, sex, and oocyte development. Summer-active flies were found to arrive 4-12 h after initial carcass exposure, with both C. macellaria and C. rufifacies arriving within 2 h of one another. Winter-active flies arrived within 48 h of one another. There was significant difference in degree of oocyte development on each of the first 3 days postmortem. These frequency differences allowed a minPMI to be calculated using a binomial analysis. When validated with seven tests using domestic and feral swine and human remains, the technique correctly estimated time of placement in six trials.", "ABSTRACT Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) rapidly secrete type I interferon (interferon ?/?, IFN) in response to virus-derived nucleic acids, facilitating both innate and adaptive antiviral responses. Conversely, aberrant IFN production by pDCs is associated with autoimmune diseases, establishing pDCs as important emerging therapeutic targets. The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular control of pDCs lineage, including its development, homeostasis and function in various immune responses. In the previous award cycles, we have identified E protein transcription factor TCF4 (E2-2) and several other factors as important regulators of pDC development. The proposed work will build upon these findings to address major unanswered questions in pDC biology. In Aim 1, we will use high-dimensional single-cell analysis methods to characterize the stage and regulation of pDC lineage specification, as well as the functional heterogeneity of mature pDCs. In Aim 2, we will use genetic approaches to dissect transcriptional control and regulation of the unique IFN-producing capacity of pDCs. Collectively, the proposed studies should yield a comprehensive molecular view of pDC development and function, paving the way for therapeutic approaches focused on this cell type.", "Long-term treatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with dexamethasone attenuates MAP kinase activation induced by insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I).\nBone formation is reduced in hyperglucocorticoid states, e.g. Cushing's syndrome or long-term treatment with synthetic glucocorticoids during rheumatic diseases. possibly related to decreased sensitivity of the target to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). In this study, we have sought to identify postreceptor-mechanisms for glucocorticoid-induced resistance to insulin-like peptides in a model system. Treatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with 100 nM dexamethasone for 48h reduced IGF-I-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase). The level of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) was reduced in dexamethasone-treated cells, as measured by Western blot; however, the pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated protein subsequent to stimulation with IGF-I (1 min) was not altered. No inhibitory effect of dexamethasone was observed on the level of phosphotyrosine in IRS-1 in extracts from IGF-I-treated cells. The amount of IGF-I-induced association of insulin receptor substrate-1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was increased in steroid treated cells. Addition of IGF-I increased the synthesis of lipid, glycogen and protein, and the reduction of a tetrazolium dye, MTS, in untreated cells. The response to IGF-I in terms of glycogen synthesis was blunted, whereas the effect of IGF-I was unaffected for the other three parameters in cells pretreated with dexamethasone. These findings indicate that the activation of MAP kinase may be dissociated from IGF-I-induced anabolic pathways and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. The results agree with the previously proposed role for the activation of MAP kinase in the regulation of glycogen synthesis. Furthermore, they suggest that dexamethasone-induced reduction of IRS-1 expression may be important for the impaired activation of MAP kinase by insulin-like peptides in steroid-treated cells.", "Focal contact formation of vascular smooth muscle cells on Langmuir-Blodgett and solvent-cast films of biodegradable poly(ester amide)s.\nThe ability of biomaterials to support the adhesion of cells is a necessary condition for their use in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. Waveguide evanescent field fluorescence (WEFF) microscopy is a relatively new microscopic technique that allows the number of cell adhesions to a waveguide surface be measured by imaging the interfacial contact region between the cells and their substratum. In this work, the adhesion of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs) to ultrathin films (20 nm) of poly(ester amide)s (PEAs) prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technology on waveguides was investigated and compared with conventional vinculin immunostaining on solvent cast PEA films. Cell culture was conducted both in the presence and absence of serum to evaluate the effect of nonspecific protein adsorption that mediates cell adhesion. WEFF microscopy analyses revealed that the cationic PEA enhanced the number of attachment sites compared with the control waveguides regardless of the culture medium. Although differences in cell adhesions between different PEAs were suggested by the results, no statistically significant differences were found. Similar results were observed with presently and previously reported vinculin immunostaining studies, further validating the use of WEFF microscopy to quantify cell adhesions. Moreover, the focal adhesions of the HCASMCs to the PEA surfaces indicate these PEAs can promote integrin signaling, which is vital in cell survival, migration, and proliferation, and ultimately in scaffold-guided vascular tissue engineering.", "Identification, detection and transmission of a new vitivirus from Mentha.\nMentha x gracilis 'Variegata' is an ornamental clone with a phenotype caused by virus infection. Several clones were ordered from mail-order nurseries in an attempt to identify a virus consistently associated with symptoms. One of these clones did not exhibit typical 'Variegata' symptoms, and steps were taken to identify any agents causing the 'off-type' symptoms. One of the viruses identified in the atypical 'Variegata' clone is a previously unknown virus, a member of the family Flexiviridae. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis indicate that the virus, designated as mint virus-2, is related to members of the species Grapevine virus A, Grapevine virus B and Heracleum latent virus, placing it in the genus Vitivirus. A detection protocol for the virus has been developed, and the mint aphid (Ovatus crataegarius) was able to transmit the virus in the presence of a helper virus but not from single infected plants.", "Adoption of a research-based practice for treatment of pressure ulcers.\nEvaluation of a skin care protocol for the treatment of pressure ulcers in this institution showed that practitioners did adopt research-based practice. This change in practice was associated with a corresponding decrease in costs for treatment. More pressure ulcers received treatment after implementation of the protocol. Furthermore, the majority of pressure ulcers were being treated with wound care modalities identified by research as supportive of healing. Use of antiseptic agents harmful to the healing process declined as did use of topical agents with little research base to support their efficacy. The shift to practice patterns that were more consistent with research findings was associated with a corresponding decrease in costs for pressure ulcer treatment. Factors in this situation that lead to the positive outcome of knowledge utilization were an organizational model that promoted accountability of individual practitioners, staff participation in decision making, agency regard for research, and consultation with a nurse expert. Informal individual utilization of knowledge related to the treatment of pressure ulcers reinforced use of the research-based practice and expedited formal implementation of a policy/procedure related to their treatment. The process of knowledge utilization that occurred in this institution provides a prototype of how research can be translated into practice. Although limited to one specific clinical problem, the results of this process can be applied to any clinical condition where there are sufficient research findings to support development of recommendations for practice.", "Carnosol inhibits cell adhesion molecules and chemokine expression by tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells through the nuclear factor-\u03baB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.\nInflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are gastrointestinal disorders associated with chronic inflammatory processes. Carnosol has been demonstrated to possess anti-inflammatory properties. This study examined the suppressive effect of carnosol on the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and chemokines in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the possible underlying mechanism. The effect of carnosol on CAM and chemokine expression in HUVECs was identified by western blotting and ELISA, respectively. nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB activation of HUVECs was analyzed using the TransAM NF-\u03baB Family kit. The effect of carnosol on the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1-induced activation of the NF-\u03baB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, and was subsequently analyzed using western blotting. Carnosol not only inhibited TNF-\u03b1-induced protein expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and E-selectin in HUVECs, but also suppressed interleukin (IL)-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 expression. In addition, carnosol inhibited the TNF-\u03b1-induced phosphorylation of p-65 and I\u03baB-\u03b1, as well as the activation of NF-\u03baB. The same result was observed in TNF-\u03b1-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p-38. It was demonstrated that carnosol inhibited TNF-\u03b1-induced CAM and chemokine expression in HUVECs. The underlying mechanism may be associated with the blocking of the NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways. These results indicate that carnosol may be a novel therapeutic agent for targeting endothelial cells in IBDs.", "Clinical evaluations of resin-modified glass-ionomer restorations.\nThis paper collates some of the existing data on the clinical evaluations of resin-modified glass-ionomer cements (RMGICs) since their introduction two decades ago. The relevant literature was considered and data reviewed under the headings of retention, marginal characteristics, material deterioration, secondary caries, color stability, as well as pulpal and biological effects. The retention for RMGICs is generally good, with an annual failure rate over 13 years reported as being under 3%. However, more data is required on their performance in carious situations. Regarding marginal characteristics, they exhibit margins that are likely to deteriorate over time. From the limited data on the surface characteristics, they appear to exhibit some wear and loss of anatomic form, particularly in the mid to long term. Despite the fact that the studies reviewed for secondary caries varied in the initial caries status of lesions restored, the overwhelming conclusion is that this does not seem to be a problem. While their initial color match may be favorable, it appears that they change over time and may not be color stable. In the absence of more clinical data, it is difficult to draw conclusions on the pulpal and biological effects. The existing information primarily reports postoperative sensitivity, which fortunately does not seem to be an issue with RMGICs, and limited histopathology of the pulp, with mixed opinions. The RMGICs appear to perform well in terms of retention, and secondary caries as well as postoperative sensitivity are not a problem. However, this is not necessarily true of their marginal characteristics, surface properties and color stability. More and long-term clinical research is required to establish compelling evidence of their behavior, particularly in terms of retention in carious cavities, surface properties and biological effects.", "Role of the tectorial membrane revealed by otoacoustic emissions recorded from wild-type and transgenic Tecta(deltaENT/deltaENT) mice.\nDistortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were recorded from wild-type mice and mutant Tecta(deltaENT/deltaENT) mice with detached tectorial membranes (TM) under combined ketamine/xylaxine anesthesia. In Tecta(deltaENT/deltaENT) mice, DPOAEs could be detected above the noise floor only when the levels of the primary tones exceeded 65 dB SPL. DPOAE amplitude decreased with increasing frequency of the primaries in Tecta(deltaENT/deltaENT) mice. This was attributed to hair cell excitation via viscous coupling to the surrounding fluid and not by interaction with the TM as in the wild-type mice. Local minima and corresponding phase transitions in the DPOAE growth functions occurred at higher DPOAE levels in wild-type than in Tecta(deltaENT/deltaENT) mice. In less-sensitive Tecta(deltaENT/deltaENT) mice, the position of the local minima varied nonsystematically with frequency or no minima were observed. A bell-like dependence of the DPOAE amplitude on the ratio of the primaries was recorded in both wild-type and Tecta(deltaENT/deltaENT) mice. However, the pattern of this dependence was different in the wild-type and Tecta(deltaENT/deltaENT) mice, an indication that the bell-like shape of the DPOAE was produced by a combination of different mechanisms. A nonlinear low-frequency resonance, revealed by nonmonotonicity of the phase behavior, was seen in the wild-type but not in Tecta(deltaENT/deltaENT) mice.", "Involvement of nitric oxide in pentylenetetrazole-induced kindling in rats.\nWe investigated the role of nitric oxide (NO) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling in rats. Seizures were induced by single administration of PTZ, which was associated with an increase in levels of NO metabolites (NOx) in the hippocampus. Pretreatment with a neuronal NO synthase inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), diminished the PTZ-induced increase in NOx levels without affecting the seizure intensity. Repeated administration of PTZ produced a gradual increase in the seizure intensity, leading to the development of kindling. In the kindled rats, PTZ at a dose of 40 mg/kg increased NOx levels in the hippocampus, whereas it had no effect in control animals. Cotreatment of 7-NI with PTZ blocked the development of kindling and attenuated the PTZ-induced increase in NOx levels. A significant increase in BDNF levels was observed in the hippocampus of the kindled rats, which returned to the control levels following seizures induced by PTZ. 7-NI reduced the hippocampal BDNF levels in control rats and suppressed the increase of BDNF levels in the kindled rats. Our findings suggest that NO plays a role in the development of PTZ-induced kindling and that BDNF may contribute to the NO-dependent plastic changes in neuronal excitability.", "Colorectal cancer screening: practices and opinions of primary care physicians.\nThe Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC), in 2001, concluded that there is good evidence to include annual or biennial fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and fair evidence to include flexible sigmoidoscopy in the periodic health examination of asymptomatic adults more than 50 years of age. Mailed survey of Alberta primary care physicians to determine current colorectal cancer (CRC) screening practices, familiarity with the new guideline, and opinions about, and barriers to, screening average-risk patients. Response rate was 58.0% (n = 965). Less than half (41.9%) were familiar with the new Canadian guideline. The majority (74.7%) recommended that asymptomatic patients undergo screening; however, only 35.6% offered screening to at least 75% of average-risk patients. Few (9.4%) rated fecal occult blood as an \"excellent or very good\" screening test. Most (64.1%) physicians would choose colonoscopy if they themselves were to undergo screening. Concerns were raised about cost-effectiveness, inconsistencies of current recommendations, and resources. Although supportive of colorectal cancer screening of average-risk patients, few physicians recommend screening for the majority of their patients. Clarification of inconsistencies between guidelines, resource issues, and the availability of efficacious screening tests is required for wider acceptance of the new Canadian guideline.", "Loss of heterozygosity at microsatellite marker sites for tumour suppressor genes in oesophageal adenocarcinoma.\nLoss of cell cycle control is an important step in the development of human tumours. A number of tumour suppressor genes are involved in cell cycle control, including p16, p53 and Rb. The aim of this study was to seek evidence of deletions of these genes in oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Paired (tumour and normal squamous epithelium) frozen tissue samples from 12 patients were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for loss of heterozygosity (LoH) at five microsatellite marker sites (two each for p16 and Rb, one for p53). Aneuploid tumour cell populations were sorted by flow cytometry prior to PCR, to eliminate stromal cell contamination. Of the 12 tumours, 11 (92%) had LoH at one or more loci. LoH at the p53 locus occurred in nine of 12 tumours, at one or both p16 loci in seven of 11 tumours, and at one or both Rb loci in eight of 12 tumours. Five tumours had LoH at two tumour suppressor gene loci, and a further four tumours had LoH at loci for all three genes. Allelic deletions of p53, p16 and Rb are common in oesophageal adenocarcinoma, and may be important in the development of this disease.", "Characteristics of Retinal Structural and Microvascular Alterations in Early Type 2 Diabetic Patients.\nTo investigate early retinal structural and microvascular changes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and to analyze relationships among the retinal structure, microvasculature, and choroid. Seventy-seven patients with type 2 DM (40 with no diabetic retinopathy [DR], 37 with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy [NPDR]), and 34 control subjects were enrolled. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, operating in radial 18-line mode, obtained macular images of the eight intraretinal layers and the choroid. The same system was equipped with Angiovue to obtain angiography images of the whole, superficial, and deep retinal capillary layers (WRCL, SRCL, and DRCL) in a 3-mm-diameter area around the macula. Algorithms quantified the thicknesses of the intraretinal layers and choroid as well as fractal dimensions (Dbox values) of the retinal capillary layers. Pearson's correlation was used to analyze the relationships. The choroidal thickness was significantly decreased in all the regions of the DM patients with no DR (P < 0.05). Compared to controls, the Dbox values of the SRCL and DRCL were significantly decreased in diabetic patients with no DR; however, only the nerve fiber layer in this group was slightly thinner than in the controls (P < 0.05). In the two diabetic groups, there was a weak correlation between the ganglion cell complex thickness and the SRCL (P < 0.05). In DM, changes of retinal microvasculature might occur earlier than changes in retinal structure. Thinning of the choroid may be the earliest sign in the diabetic patients with no clinical DR.", "[Use of PCR methods for identification of Listeria monocytogenes in milk].\nThe aim of this work was to estimate the limit of Listeria monocytogenes cfu in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for a DNA fragment of listeriolysine O (hly A) gene. The PCR method, with used primers selected in areas of the listeriolysin O gene, allows to differentiate L. monocytogenes strains from other Listeria species. The amplified fragment (456 bp) of hly A gene was obtained for all strains L. monocytogenes and no other Listeria species. The PCR method with the selected primers allowed to detect 50-500 cfu L. monocytogenes/ml suspended in water or milk. Among 20 samples of raw milk from cows, 10 samples contained > 50 cfu L. monocytogenes/ml. Obtained results indicate that the PCR assay of L. monocytogenes identification is technically simple and may be conduct with minimal time. So, it could be recommended as quick diagnostic method in identification L. monocytogenes in milk.", "Nonlinearity of spatial summation in simple cells of areas 17 and 18 of cat visual cortex.\n1. Nonlinearity of spatial summation in areas 17 and 18 of cat visual cortex was compared with the type of spatial nonlinearity that differentiates X and Y cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and retina. The comparisons were made to examine to what extent the information from X and Y cells may remain separated in higher visual centers. 2. Responses of simple cells in areas 17 and 18 were recorded while stationary, optimally oriented sinewave gratings were sinusoidally modulated within the receptive field of the cell. Both the spatial frequency and spatial phase of the stimulus were varied. 3. Y cells in the retina and LGN are defined by the presence of a specific form of spatial nonlinearity. When tested with contrast-modulated sinewave gratings of spatial frequencies about three-fold greater than the optimal, their responses are dominated by a frequency-doubled component. The amplitude of the frequency-doubled component is not dependent on the spatial phase of the stimulus. 4. Many simple cells in the cortex showed a form of spatial nonlinearity similar to the defining nonlinearity found in retinal and geniculate Y cells. A frequency-doubled response dominated at spatial frequencies more than threefold greater than the optimal spatial frequency. When this response was present, it was phase independent. 5. More than 50% of the simple cells in area 18 showed the Y-like spatial nonlinearity. Fewer than 10% of the simple cells in area 17 showed the Y-like spatial nonlinearity. 6. The virtual absence of Y-like nonlinearity in area 17 and its relative abundance in area 18 suggest that the functional separation between the parallel X and Y pathways remains distinct within areas 17 and 18 of cat visual cortex.", "West Nile virus.\nWest Nile (WN) virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus and human, equine, and avian neuropathogen. The virus is indigenous to Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia, and has recently caused large epidemics in Romania, Russia, and Israel. Birds are the natural reservoir (amplifying) hosts, and WN virus is maintained in nature in a mosquito-bird-mosquito transmission cycle primarily involving Culex sp mosquitoes. WN virus was recently introduced to North America, where it was first detected in 1999 during an epidemic of meningoencephalitis in New York City. During 1999-2002, the virus extended its range throughout much of the eastern parts of the USA, and its range within the western hemisphere is expected to continue to expand. During 1999-2001, 142 cases of neuroinvasive WN viral disease of the central nervous system (including 18 fatalities), and seven cases of uncomplicated WN fever were reported in the USA. Most human WN viral infections are subclinical but clinical infections can range in severity from uncomplicated WN fever to fatal meningoencephalitis; the incidence of severe neuroinvasive disease and death increase with age. Serology remains the mainstay of laboratory diagnosis. No WN virus-specific treatment or vaccine is available. Prevention depends on organised, sustained vector mosquito control, and public education.", "Immunohistochemical expression of RBP2 and LSD1 in papillary thyroid carcinoma.\nTo investigate the prognostic significance of LSD1 and RBP2 expression in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma. LSD1 and RBP2 expressions were detected by immunohistochemistry in surgically resected samples from thyroid adenoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma and paracancerous tissues. To be members of histone demethylases, LSD1 and RBP2 were both localized mainly to the thyroid cell nucleus. Despite the fact that both RBP2 and LSD1 expressions were higher in papillary thyroid carcinoma than in paracancerous tissues (U=-3.855, p=0.000; U=-5.575, p=0.000) and thyroid adenoma (U=-1.972, p=0.049; U=-3.190, p=0.001), they did not show us statistical correlation (r=-0.149, p=0.270). Like LSD1 (U=-2.286, p=0.022), RBP2 expression was less frequently in paracancerous tissues than in thyroid adenoma (U=-1.985, p=0.047). Neither LSD1 nor RBP2 expression was significantly associated with age, gender, stage status, tumor size, and lymph node metastases (p>0.05). Both LSD1 and RBP2 are well related with the occurrence and malignant transformation of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Though the positive expression of both LSD1 and RBP2 can be used to estimate the potentiality of thyroid carcinoma and help for the adjuvant treatment, LSD1 is a more sensitive molecular marker than RBP2 on thyroid cancer diagnosis.", "Body mass index and risk of pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nThe aims of our meta-analysis were to examine the pattern and gender's influence on body mass index (BMI) - pneumonia relationship. Published studies were searched from PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library databases using keywords of pneumonia, BMI and epidemiologic studies. Random-effects analysis was applied to estimate pooled effect sizes from individual studies. The Cochrane Q-test and index of heterogeneity (I(2) ) were used to evaluate heterogeneity, and Egger's test was used to evaluate publication bias. Random-effects meta-regression was applied to examine the pattern and gender's influence on BMI-pneumonia relationship. A total of 1,531 studies were initially identified, and 25 studies finally were included. The pooled relative risk (RR) and meta-regression model revealed a J-shaped relationship between BMI and risk of community-acquired pneumonia (underweight, RR 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-2.2, P < 0.01; overweight, 0.89, 95%CI, 0.8-1.03, P, 0.1; obesity, 1.03, 95% CI, 0.8-1.3, p. 8) and U-shaped relationship between BMI and risk of influenza-related pneumonia (underweight, RR 1.9, 95% CI, 1.2-3, P < 0.01; overweight, 0.89, 95% CI, 0.79-0.99, P, 0.03; obesity, 1.3, 95% CI, 1.05-1.63, p. 2; morbidity obesity, 4.6, 95% CI, 2.2-9.8, P < 0.01); whereas, no difference in risk of nosocomial pneumonia was found across the BMI groups. Gender difference did not make significant contribution in modifying BMI-pneumonia risk relationship.", "Resorcinol-formaldehyde resins as metal-free semiconductor photocatalysts for solar-to-hydrogen peroxide energy conversion.\nArtificial photosynthesis is a critical challenge in moving towards a sustainable energy future. Photocatalytic generation of hydrogen peroxide from water and dioxygen (H2O + [Formula: see text]O2 \u2192 H2O2, \u0394G\u00b0 = 117 kJ mol-1) by sunlight is a promising strategy for artificial photosynthesis because H2O2 is a storable and transportable fuel that can be used directly for electricity generation. All previously reported powder photocatalysts, however, have suffered from low efficiency in H2O2 generation. Here we report that resorcinol-formaldehyde resins, widely used inexpensive polymers, act as efficient semiconductor photocatalysts to provide a new basis for H2O2 generation. Simple high-temperature hydrothermal synthesis (~523 K) produces low-bandgap resorcinol-formaldehyde resins comprising \u03c0-conjugated and \u03c0-stacked benzenoid-quinoid donor-acceptor resorcinol couples. The resins absorb broad-wavelength light up to 700 nm and catalyse water oxidation and O2 reduction by the photogenerated charges. Simulated sunlight irradiation of the resins stably generates H2O2 with more than 0.5% solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency. Therefore, this metal-free system shows significant potential as a new artificial photosynthesis system.", "[Effects of aluminum stress on ecophysiological characteristics of male and female Populus cathayana seedlings].\nThis paper studied the sex-specific differences of male and female Populus cathayana seedlings in their ecophysiological characteristics and photosynthesis under the stress of aluminum (216 mg Al(3+) x kg(-1)). Under the effects of aluminum, the malonaldehyde (MDA) and soluble protein (Pr) contents of the male and female seedlings increased significantly (P < 0.001), and the males had a significantly lower MDA content and a significantly higher Pr content than the females. The peroxidase (POD) activity of the males increased but the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased significantly, while the POD and SOD activities of the females had no significant variation. The net photosynthetic rate (Pn) of both male and female seedlings decreased significantly (P = 0.001), and the transpiration rate (Tr) of the female seedlings decreased (P = 0.007) and the instant water use efficiency (WUEi) increased significantly, while no significant variations were observed in the Tr and WUEi of the male seedlings. The total chlorophyll and chlorophyll a contents and chlorophyll a/b ratio of the females decreased significantly, resulting in a significantly higher chlorophyll a/b ratio of the males. The specific leaf area (SLA) of the females decreased but that of the males increased significantly. No significant variation was observed on the leaf- and stem dry mass. Comparing with the females, the males had higher Pr and chlorophyll contents and higher active antioxidant enzymes activity to maintain higher Pn, and thus, had greater resistance against aluminum stress.", "Influence of different benzodiazepines on the experimental morphine abstinence syndrome.\nThe abuse of benzodiazepines by narcotic addicts has been well documented. However, the pharmacological basis of this abuse is not clear. In this study the effects of different benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam: 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg; nitrazepam: 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg; diazepam: 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg; chlordiazepoxide: 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg; and triazolam: 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg) on the morphine withdrawal syndrome in mice have been compared. Drugs were administered 30 min before naloxone-induced withdrawal. All benzodiazepines tested induced similar changes in some of the signs of morphine abstinence: decreased jumping behavior and increased wet dog shake frequency. Jumping behavior was particularly decreased by triazolam and wet dog shakes were mainly increased by flunitrazepam and nitrazepam. Forepaw treading was reduced by flunitrazepam, diazepam and triazolam, increased by nitrazepam and not changed by chlordiazepoxide. Tremor was effectively reduced by diazepam but less reliably by the other benzodiazepines. Teeth chattering was reduced by flunitrazepam and diazepam. These results indicate that benzodiazepines can interfere with the expression of the morphine withdrawal syndrome.", "[Medical treatment of hypertrophic myocardiopathy. Comparison of propranolol and verapamil].\nIt remains difficult to make a reasoned choice between betablockers and calcium antagonists in the medical treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In order to help in making this choice, we compared the effects of 320 mg of propranolol and 480 mg of verapamil, prescribed in a random order for an average period of 2.5 months in 24 patients. In 15 patients the two therapeutic sequences were preceded and followed by a clinical examination and an exercise stress test after withdrawal of all treatment. The overall functional status correlated to oxygen consumption was unchanged by the two drugs, but patients felt better more often with verapamil. These was no significant change in maximal power developed during exercise testing although verapamil increased it by 9 p. 100 throughout with a corresponding increase in oxygen consumption. Two parameters were significantly changed by both drugs: the maximal heart rate fell from 161 +/- 22 to 122 +/- 18 with propranolol, and to 145 +/- 28 with verapamil; the oxygen pulse (equivalent to the systolic index) increased from 10.9 +/- 2.2 to 14.8 +/- 3.9 with propranolol, and to 13.7 +/- 2.4 with verapamil. There were no changes in the blood pressure profiles during exercise. Side effects were observed with both drugs; muscular weakness was the biggest problem with propranolol and sinus node dysfunction with verapamil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "Viscoelastic nature of isolated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit cuticles: a mathematical model.\nViscoelastic behaviour of isolated tomato fruit cuticle (CM) is well known and extensively described. Temperature and hydration conditions modify the mechanical properties of CM. Mechanical data from previous transient-creep analysis developed in tomato fruit cuticle under different temperature and hydration conditions have been used to propose a rheological model that describes the viscoelastic nature of CM. As a composite material, the biomechanical behaviour of the plant cuticle will depend not only on the mechanical characteristics of the individual components by themselves but also on the sum of them. Based on this previous information, we proposed a two-element model to describe the experimental behaviour: an elastic hookean element connected in parallel to a viscous element or Voigt element that will describe the mechanical behaviour of the isolated CM and cutin under the studied conditions. The main parameters of the model, E(1) and E(2) will reflect the elastic and viscoelastic behaviour of the cuticle. Relationship between these physical parameters and the change in CM properties were discussed in order to elucidate the rheological processes taking place in CM. This model describes both the influence of temperature and hydration and the behaviour of the isolated cutin and the inferred contribution of the cuticle fraction of polysaccharides when the whole cuticle is tested.", "The Optimal Length of Stay Associated With the Lowest Readmission Risk Following Surgery.\nIndex length of stay (LOS) and readmissions are viewed as important quality measures. However, these metrics represent competing demands as an inordinate reduction in LOS may lead to unplanned readmissions. We sought to assess the optimal LOS associated with the lowest 90-d readmission rate following discharge after common surgical procedures. This was a retrospective study relying on Tricare claims. We identified all eligible adult patients (18-64 y) receiving a series of common surgical procedures between 2006 and 2014. We used a generalized additive model with spline regression to determine the optimal LOS associated with the lowest 90-d risk of readmission. Ninety-day readmission rates varied from 6.03% to 34.69%. Most procedures exhibited a logit linear relationship, with the lowest risk of readmission evident on postoperative day-1 and increasing thereafter. Among the more invasive procedures (e.g., esophagectomy and radical cystectomy), a U-shaped relationship was realized, indicating that expedited discharge would increase the potential for readmission as would any extended hospital LOS. For these procedures, the ideal index LOS appeared to be 6-7 d for radical cystectomy and 12-13 d for esophagectomy. Our results support the practice of discharging patients as soon as clinically feasible after hip and knee arthroplasty, lumbar spine surgery, hernia repair, appendectomy, nephrectomy, and colectomy. Among esophagectomy or radical cystectomy, there is a well-defined optimal index admission period and discharge outside this window appears to be detrimental. Our results suggest that invasive procedures appear to possess a unique \"signature\" when it comes to optimal LOS.", "A priori typology-based prediction of benthic macroinvertebrate fauna for ecological classification of rivers.\nWe evaluated a simple bioassessment method based on a priori river typology to predict benthic macroinvertebrate fauna in riffle sites of rivers in the absence of human influence. Our approach predicted taxon lists specific to four river types differing in catchment area with a method analogous to the site-specific RIVPACS-type models. The reference sites grouped in accordance with their type in NMS ordination, indicating that the typology efficiently accounted for natural variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages. Compared with a null model, typology greatly increased the precision of prediction and sensitivity to detect human impairment and strengthened the correlation of the ratio of observed-to-expected number of predicted taxa (O/E) with the measured stressor variables. The performance of the typology-based approach was equal to that of a RIVPACS-type predictive model that we developed. Exclusion of rarest taxa with low occurrence probabilities improved the performance of both approaches by all criteria. With an increasing inclusion threshold of occurrence probability, especially the predictive model sensitivity first increased but then decreased. Many common taxa with intermediate type-specific occurrence probabilities were consistently missing from impacted sites, a result suggesting that these taxa may be especially important in detecting human disturbances. We conclude that if a typology-based approach such as that suggested by the European Union's Water Framework Directive is required, the O/E ratio of type-specific taxa can be a useful metric for assessment of the status of riffle macroinvertebrate communities. Successful application of the approach, however, requires biologically meaningful river types with a sufficient pool of reference sites for each type.", "Determination of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in human serum by fluorescence labelling and high-performance liquid chromatography.\nA method is described for the determination of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in human blood serum. The problems of sensitivity and selectivity encountered with previous techniques were avoided by the formation of a highly fluorescent Diels-Alder adduct following solid-phase extraction of the vitamin. After excess of reagent had been eliminated, quantification was achieved by high-performance liquid chromatography. The recovery of the vitamin from serum was 76.4 +/- 1.76%. The precision of the method was determined, and the relative standard deviations were 8.38% at a concentration of 47.0 x 10(-9) mol dm-3, 6.74% at a concentration of 99.8 x 10(-9) mol dm-3 and 3.79% at a concentration of 146.8 x 10(-9) mol dm-3. The detection limit for the adduct was 2.93 x 10(-14) mol injected, for a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1, and serum concentrations of 0.25 x 10(-9) mol dm-3 could easily be quantified. No interference from endogenous or exogenous substances was observed.", "Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and healing of hip fracture in Alzheimer's disease patients: a retrospective cohort study.\nThis study was designed to assess effects of cholinergic stimulation using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), a group of drugs that stimulate cholinergic receptors and are used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD), on healing of hip fractures. A retrospective cohort study was performed using 46-female AD patients, aged above 75 years, who sustained hip fractures. Study analyses included the first 6-months after hip fracture fixation procedure. Presence of AChEIs was used as predictor variable. Other variables that could affect study outcomes: age, body mass index (BMI), mental state or type of hip fracture, were also included. Radiographic union at fracture site (Hammer index), bone quality (Singh index) and fracture healing complications were recorded as study outcomes. The collected data was analyzed by student's-t, Mann-Whitney-U and chi-square tests. No significant differences in age, BMI, mental state or type of hip fracture were observed between AChEIs-users and nonusers. However, AChEIs-users had better radiographic union at the fracture site (relative risk (RR),2.7; 95%confidence interval (CI),0.9-7.8), better bone quality (RR,2.0; 95%CI,1.2-3.3) and fewer healing complications (RR,0.8; 95%CI,0.7-1.0) than nonusers. In elderly female patients with AD, the use of AChEIs might be associated with an enhanced fracture healing and minimized complications.", "Intermolecular ligation mediates efficient cotransformation in Phytophthora infestans.\nThe processing of DNA molecules during transformation was characterized in the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. Linear and circular forms of non-replicating transformation vectors supported similar rates of stable transformation. Remarkably, digestion of plasmids within the selectable marker genes neomycin phosphotransferase (npt) or hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt) had little effect on the recovery of drug-resistant transformants, and the cleaved sites were shown to be reconstituted in the transformants. An assay for the transient expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) in protoplasts treated with partial or disrupted GUS genes demonstrated that active genes could be reconstituted through intramolecular and/or intermolecular ligation between compatible ends, while incompatible ends were inefficiently joined. Stable transformation studies also demonstrated that complementing portions of incomplete npt or hpt genes joined through homologous recombination. Based on the indication of efficient ligation between DNA molecules during transformation, an efficient procedure for cotransformation was developed. The frequency of cotransformation between vectors expressing selected genes (npt or hpt) and nonselected sequences (GUS, beta-galactosidase, or streptomycin phosphotransferase) approached unity when the plasmids were linearized with the same restriction enzyme before transformation. In contrast, cotransformation between circular plasmids or those cut with different enzymes occurred infrequently (10%). Hybridization analysis of DNA from cotransformants demonstrated that linearized plasmids became colocalized within genomic DNA, while circular plasmids typically inserted at unliked sites.", "[The diagnostic value of immunologic findings in the differentiation of chronic liver diseases].\nVarious types of virus induced and non-virus induced chronic active hepatitis (CAH) as well as chronic non-suppurative destructive cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis have to be distinguished. Classical autoimmune type \"lupoid\" CAH is characterized by antinuclear antibodies (ANA), liver membrane antibodies (LMA) and smooth muscle antibodies (SMA). A second subgroup of autoimmune type CAH is characterized by anti liver kidney-microsomal antibodies (LKM) which are directed against a specific cytochrome p-450 isoenzyme. A third subgroup of autoimmune type CAH is identified by auto-antibodies to a soluble cytoplasmic liver antigen (SLA). Autoimmune type CAH profits from immuno-suppressive therapy, i.e. corticosteroids alone or in combination with azathioprin. Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is nowadays treated with Interferon when HBV-DNA is detectable in serum, duration of liver disease is less than 5 years and superinfection with HDV and HIV can be excluded. PBC is diagnosed through the detection of antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) and its PBC specific subtypes anti p 62 (M2) and anti p 48. Aetiology and pathogenesis of PBC are still unknown. Liver transplantation is an established therapy for endstage PBC. This is also true for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).", "Interdisciplinary Management of a Class III Anterior Open Bite Malocclusion in a Patient With Cerebral Palsy.\nDentofacial disharmony in patients with cerebral palsy (CP) can lead to low self-esteem and functional limitations. However, medical and behavioral challenges in patients with developmental disorders often prevent dental practitioners from offering the necessary treatment. This report describes the clinical interdisciplinary management of a 20-year-old man with CP, including orthodontic, periodontal, and orthognathic surgery therapy. The patient presented with the chief complaint of having difficulty chewing, was wheelchair dependent, had poor orofacial muscle control, and exhibited a Class III malocclusion with a skeletal anterior open bite. The lower midline was shifted 3 mm to the right, there was severe maxillary spacing, and the patient had gingival overgrowth. A combined orthodontic, periodontal, and orthognathic surgery treatment approach was chosen to meet the patient's interdisciplinary needs. Because of his physical limitations, it was necessary to avoid complicated and prolonged orthodontic treatment mechanics. Interdisciplinary therapy improved the patient's oral function, periodontal health, and facial esthetics and led to a good occlusion, which remained stable 1 year after treatment. Regardless of the treatment challenges, combined orthodontic and surgical therapy in the present patient with CP led to favorable treatment results and improved the patient's self-esteem, confidence in social interactions, and speaking and chewing abilities."]
